  <string id="120538">I can&apos;t face them!</string>
  <string id="120539">Fear holds me.</string>
  <string id="120540">I... I can&apos;t do this!</string>
  <string id="120541">This is not a pleasure to be a part of!</string>
  <string id="120542">Such horror!</string>
  <string id="120543" soundid="181150">Be serious. This worries me. The world seems to be filling up with wayward spirits. That it affected the Forest Shadow is very disturbing.</string>
  <string id="120544" soundid="181151">That is very sweet of you to say. We should get back to what we need to do. Is there anything else you need?</string>
  <string id="120545">Don&apos;t feel bad for being special. In my eyes, you have no choice.</string>
  <string id="120546">You let that slip to interest me. Tell me about it.</string>
  <string id="120547">You know you can ask me for anything as long as I have your company.</string>
  <string id="120548">Tell me about that. How... sensitive are you?</string>
  <string id="120550">You stand out. I prefer that. I know the feeling.</string>
  <string id="120551">I&apos;ve always been interested in you. Tell me what you remember.</string>
  <string id="120552">And I value you a great deal as well. What did you want to talk about?</string>
  <string id="120553">We can put things right if we stay together.</string>
  <string id="120554">If you depend on me, I consider that a privilege, not a burden.</string>
  <string id="120555">I welcome that admission. What is on your mind?</string>
  <string id="120578" soundid="181193">It would seem that my past is catching up to me, and you are destined to be swept along. You have faced your first spirit opponents far sooner than I intended.</string>
  <string id="120579" soundid="181194">Dawn Star can explain the nature of such creatures. I must go and make sure everything is in place. I thought I had more time, but perhaps you are ready.</string>
  <string id="120581" soundid="181196">Do not be so quick to thank me. My influence caused this attack. You were not meant to see this yet, but now there is no choice. I will explain at the school.</string>
  <string id="120582" soundid="181197">You have done well, but more than this awaits you. See to your fellow villagers and students and return to me at the school. We have... a great deal to discuss.</string>
  <string id="120583" soundid="181198">You would have fought, and you would have died. You are not ready, but you soon will be. There is no choice left to us. I will explain at the school.</string>
  <string id="120587">Thank you for your assistance, Master Li.</string>
  <string id="120590">Why did you step in? I could have fought him.</string>
  <string id="120597" soundid="187931">Ah, you&apos;re one of them, are you? Follower of the Way of the Closed Fist? Whatever your motives, I think we both understand the language of silver.</string>
  <string id="120598" soundid="187932">Ha. You know, I honestly didn&apos;t think you&apos;d do it.</string>
  <string id="120601" soundid="187933">You make an interesting point. These people complained when the old town was flooded, and now they complain about just the opposite.</string>
  <string id="120602" soundid="187934">A businessman with plenty of silver to spare might be able to restore the old town, and control most of the land around here.</string>
  <string id="120603" soundid="187935">Yes, I think Tien&apos;s Landing would do quite well under my... guidance. The next few years will be interesting times.</string>
  <string id="120604" soundid="187936">A philosopher with a head for business. Will wonders never cease?</string>
  <string id="120605" soundid="187937">Yes, of course. I will remember your help. I have a feeling crossing you would be the act of an idiot.</string>
  <string id="120606">I prefer something useful. Your weapon, for example.</string>
  <string id="120607">Physical strength is the quality I am interested in.</string>
  <string id="120608">I am interested in improving my mind.</string>
  <string id="120609">I am concerned with spiritual matters.</string>
  <string id="120610">Have you encountered any interesting gems?</string>
  <string id="120611" soundid="181269">I&apos;m eager to try another attempt at this map. The route is rough, but there is something about it that inspires me. I need to see the whole thing for it to make sense.</string>
  <string id="120612" soundid="181270">Ready for another attempt at the map we found in the Furnace? I&apos;m sure completing it will jog my memory even more.</string>
  <string id="120613" soundid="181271">Yes, I&apos;m glad you want to make another attempt. This is very serious. We could rescue the greatest inventor the Empire has ever known. More or less.</string>
  <string id="120614" soundid="181272">Well, that was a bit bumpy. Still, I can tighten up a bolt or two and we&apos;ll be ready to try again! We really should try again, you know?</string>
  <string id="120805" soundid="181463">Lead on. I will follow. What choice do I have?</string>
  <string id="120806" soundid="181464"></string>
  <string id="120807" soundid="181465">Direct me where you wish. I have no say in the matter. That is what you wanted, isn&apos;t it? Unquestioning, meaningless obedience?</string>
  <string id="120808" soundid="181466">I follow as directed. I am capable of nothing else. You sustain me now.</string>
  <string id="120809" soundid="181467">I am thoroughly surprised that I even considered entering this place without being bound to your will. What was I thinking?</string>
  <string id="120810" soundid="181468"></string>
  <string id="120811" soundid="181469">Ya Zhen: What is it now? Hurry with your preparations so we can move on to more... interesting things.</string>
  <string id="120812" soundid="181470">Chai Ka: You are progressing as only you are able. The fate of the Empire is yours to decide.</string>
  <string id="120813" soundid="181471"></string>
  <string id="120816" soundid="181474">Direct me as you must, but do not expect me to like it. I am just a tool to you.</string>
  <string id="120817" soundid="181475">We have to find Master Li and stop him. We can&apos;t let this continue.</string>

  <string id="122782">Here&apos;s some general chit chat coming down the pipe.</string>
  <string id="122783">I&apos;m done.</string>
  <string id="122784">Over a thousand years ago, Emperor Sagacious Tien united the lands that make up the Jade Empire.</string>
  <string id="122785">Use Chi Strikes (press the &lt;ChiStrike&gt; key in combat) to add damage to your attacks.</string>
  <string id="122786">Use Chi to heal yourself (&lt;ChiHeal&gt;), deal more damage (&lt;ChiStrike&gt;), and power magic and transformation styles.</string>
  <string id="122787">Sometimes it is better not to pick up a power-up immediately. It may come in handy later in the battle.</string>
  <string id="122788">When wounded and outnumbered in combat, an Area Attack (&lt;FastAttack&gt; + &lt;StrongAttack&gt;) can buy you enough time to use Chi Heal.</string>
  <string id="122789">Demons are immune to Support styles such as Storm Dragon and Heavenly Wave.</string>
  <string id="122790">Sometimes it is helpful to leap out of the heat of battle and regroup. Use evades (&lt;Block&gt; + &lt;Up&gt;, &lt;Left&gt;, &lt;Down&gt;, or &lt;Right&gt;) to find a better position in combat.</string>
  <string id="122791">Use followers to supplement your preferred styles. A close quarters fighter can complement a character that uses magic at range.</string>
  <string id="122792">A follower assigned to Support mode is ignored by enemies. You are enhanced by their meditations, but you must fight solo.</string>
  <string id="122793">Use &lt;FightStyle1&gt;, &lt;FightStyle2&gt;, &lt;FightStyle3&gt;, or &lt;FightStyle4&gt; to quickly change styles. Press and hold &lt;FightStyle1&gt;, &lt;FightStyle2&gt;, &lt;FightStyle3&gt;, or &lt;FightStyle4&gt; to assign a style. The game will pause during selection, even in combat.</string>
  <string id="122794">Weapon styles are powerful, but they drain your Focus and cannot damage spirits. Versatility is the key to victory.</string>
  <string id="122795">Weapon styles like Fortune&apos;s Favorite or Golden Star are helpful when you&apos;re surrounded. </string>
  <string id="122796">Use Support styles like Heavenly Wave to set your opponents up for devastating Martial-style attacks.</string>
  <string id="122797">All spirits are immune to Support and Weapon styles, but vulnerable to Martial and Magic styles.</string>
  <string id="122798">Harmonic combos are great for finishing off opponents. Read each Martial or Support style&apos;s description to learn its role in harmonic combos.</string>
  <string id="122799">Blocking (&lt;Block&gt;) can save your life when fighting enemies who use projectile attacks.</string>
  <string id="122800">Chi Heal (&lt;ChiHeal&gt;) can make all the difference in combat. Be sure to use it before it is too late.</string>
  <string id="122801">Focus mode (&lt;Focus&gt;) is powerful but taxing. Use it sparingly to escape difficult situations.</string>
  <string id="122802">Your magical weapons drain Focus (the yellow bar) as you use them. Be careful not to run out of Focus at critical moments.</string>
  <string id="122803">Some enemies are immune to certain types of attacks, so vary your tactics in combat by switching styles.</string>
  <string id="122804">Support styles do no damage, but they have significant effects that weaken opponents without consuming your Chi or Focus.</string>
  <string id="122805">Raise or lower difficulty to fit the level of challenge you want. Press &lt;Menu&gt; and select Difficulty from the Options screen at any time.</string>
  <string id="122806">Books and scrolls grant experience and valuable insight into the history of the Empire.</string>
  <string id="122807">Techniques are training aids that permanently modify stats. Choose carefully; powerful increases may be balanced by penalties elsewhere.</string>
  <string id="122808">The Way of the Closed Fist was originally put forth by a philosopher named Bladed Thesis, who felt that strength was the ultimate virtue. 
</string>
  <string id="122809">Pause the game (&lt;CombatPause&gt;) at any time to switch styles or plan your next move.</string>
  <string id="122810">Refer to the Journal for a summary of your active quests, or to review what you have completed.</string>
  <string id="122811">If an opponent is too challenging, adjust difficulty from the Options screen. This change may even be done during combat.</string>
  <string id="122812">Followers in Support mode are ignored by enemies. Your abilities are enhanced but all opponents focus on you.</string>
  <string id="122813">Meditating at Chi and Focus shrines before important battles can give you the edge you need.</string>
  <string id="122814">Surplus essence gems can be sold to merchants for silver.</string>
  <string id="122815">Equipping the right combination of gems can give you a significant boost in certain fights.</string>
  <string id="122816">Violence isn&apos;t the only solution to a problem. Sometimes persuasion can get you out of a tough spot.</string>
  <string id="122817">Explore to find gems to place into your Dragon Amulet. These gems will enhance your abilities.</string>
  <string id="122818">Look for chests and other breakable objects that contain silver or gems. Be careful, some may be rigged with traps.</string>
  <string id="122819">New friends and enemies can come from anywhere. Be mindful in your dealings with the people you meet.</string>
  <string id="122820">Speak to the arena&apos;s fighters to find out more about them and the arena itself.</string>
  <string id="122821">Some styles are difficult to grasp if you do not first understand the particular moral philosophies that make them work.</string>
  <string id="122822">With the way to the underworld blocked, death is only the beginning.</string>
  <string id="122823">Despite their differences, Dawn Star and Silk Fox can be quite powerful if they work together.</string>
  <string id="122824">You are restored to life, but your task is not yet complete.</string>
  <string id="122825">Each of your followers has a unique strength. You will need to rely on them to succeed.</string>
  <string id="122826">Once again Dirge is the site of a major siege. This time, you and your followers are the targets.</string>
  <string id="122827">Doubt can cripple even the most powerful warrior.</string>
  <string id="122828">Your last visit to the palace was a violent one. This time your enemy is more powerful, but so are you.</string>
  <string id="122829">The calm before the storm. With his army repelled, your former Master awaits you in his palace.</string>
  <string id="122830">Your choices will dictate the fate of the Empire. Choose your actions wisely, and keep the consequences in mind.</string>
  <string id="122831">All demons are immune to Support styles, and some are immune to Magic styles.</string>
  <string id="122832">The Long Drought was a dark time in the Empire&apos;s history, but some whisper that darker times are yet ahead.</string>
  <string id="122833">Phoenix Gate, the biggest city in the Prosperous East, is the center of trade in the Jade Empire.</string>
  <string id="122834">The Wall once surrounded and protected a young Jade Empire. Now it stands as a testament to Imperial drive and ambition.</string>
  <string id="122835">The Horselords of the Plain of Barren Hope threatened the Jade Empire&apos;s northern border until Zeng Sai, their greatest warlord, fell to the Imperial Army.</string>
  <string id="122836">The Golden Delta is at once the source of the Empire&apos;s richest farmland and its poorest people.</string>
  <string id="122837">The Outlanders of the Mysterious East wear suits of metal armor and speak in a strange, lilting language unknown in the Jade Empire.</string>
  <string id="122838">The bloodlust of the mad Emperor Zian was so consuming that he sent the Imperial Army after his own subjects in an attempt to slake his murderous impulses.</string>
  <string id="122839">The spiritual teachings of Lao Tsi serve as the basis from which much of Jade Empire society springs.</string>
  <string id="122840">The Celestial Bureaucracy governs the heavens and assigns each spirit its station in creation.</string>
  <string id="122841">Even the mightiest of spirits have strict roles to play. Those who act outside their station often become demons and torment mankind.</string>
  <string id="122842">Women in the Jade Empire enjoy all of the rights of the Empire&apos;s men. Many of the Empire&apos;s finest warriors are women.</string>
  <string id="122843">Elephant demons are viciously territorial guardians, but only for spirits or sorcerers strong enough to inspire loyalty.</string>
  <string id="122844">Horse demons are sadistic creatures that call forth searing flames to torment their victims.</string>
  <string id="122845">Emperor Sun Hai&apos;s withdrawal from the public eye leads some to wonder if he is truly still in control at all.</string>
  <string id="122846">While most demons ignore their given station and enjoy tormenting mortals, some are truly honorable and want only the best for creation.</string>
  <string id="122847">The night before a battle is always restless.</string>
  <string id="122848">Theater in the Jade Empire is rare and entertaining, but only the most skillful of satirists can effect any real insightful message.</string>
  <string id="122849">Magic in the Jade Empire is elemental or spiritual in nature. Anything else is usually considered superstition.</string>
  <string id="122850">While some ogres may seem musclebound and stupid, most possess the skill to craft and use reasonably advanced arms and armor.</string>
  <string id="122851">As hideous and dangerous as they are, ogres are not demons. They are natural creatures made warlike by their territorial nature.</string>
  <string id="122852">The Jade Empire&apos;s use of an explosive substance called dragon powder makes opposing its military a deadly proposition.</string>
  <string id="122853">The Jade Empire was formed when Sagacious Tien united many provinces under his rule, making for a land of diverse names, languages, and cultures.</string>
  <string id="122854">The Lotus Assassins were once known as the Lotus Order, monks dedicated to the protection and spiritual development of the presiding emperor.</string>

  <string id="123298">
Travelers in the Great Southern Forest often report strange sightings and bizarre phenomena. Aside from the hospitality of the Pilgrim&apos;s Rest Inn, the forest is nearly entirely wilderness, and the verdant canopy of the forest hides wonderful and fearsome creatures unlike any seen anywhere else in the Empire. 

The strangest tales are those of a shadow among the trees that seems to follow visitors to the forest. Philosophers hoping to reflect in the peace of the forest often report feeling watched, and patrons of the Pilgrim&apos;s Rest Inn claim to have seen a strange silhouette darting among the trees. Despite the apparently otherworldly nature of this figure, those who witness it sense no aggression and attribute it to the mysteries of the forest.</string>
  <string id="123300">The Physical Universe: A Rebuttal</string>
  <string id="123301">
The world that we live in is not as simplistic as Philosopher Jiang would suggest in his treatise on the physical universe. His hypotheses regarding divine regulation of weather and seasons, though interesting, is nothing more than children&apos;s tales made overly complicated. Recent research, led by Scholar Dongow, has proven that our seasons and weather are much more than the careless whims of distant celestial beings. Our universe is made up of very real, very tangible components that can be carefully quantified and qualified.</string>
  <string id="123302">The Physical Universe: The Philosopher&apos;s Viewpoint</string>
  <string id="123303">
Though Scholar Shao Shiang has raised several interesting points in his rebuttal to my treatise on the physical world, his lack of respect for the divine is of greater concern than his lack of understanding of the physical world around him. I agree that there are many aspects to our world that cannot be explained by divine influence alone. We learn and continue to thrive at the mercy of the celestial beings. Without their guidance, and indeed, their blessing, we would quickly discover that research and understanding of our physical world alone are not nearly enough for us to survive.</string>
  <string id="123304">The Physical Universe: The Scholar&apos;s Hypothesis</string>
  <string id="123305">
To suggest that I, of all people, do not understand the significance or the importance of the celestial beings is preposterous. I pay my tributes at the temple because I honor those who gave us our minds and our curiosity. Philosopher Jiang ignores the crux of the problem by hiding behind his arguments of divine belief. The scholars have made some recent discoveries, such as the way in which clouds are formed. But the philosophers, lead by Jiang, dismiss these theories without even hearing them out. How can we progress as a society if we refuse to accept new ideas and new concepts? The philosophers would have us cling to our traditions, even at the cost of our own prosperity.</string>
  <string id="123307">The Physical Universe: A Final Word</string>
  <string id="123308">
Scholar Shao Shiang has once again missed the central point of the philosophers&apos; argument. We do not wish to stall development, nor do we seek to stop people from learning. Philosophers see the work of the divine in the physical world and oppose those who defy tradition only because they find those customs inconvenient or outdated. Learning and respect for the past need not be mutually exclusive; we seek only to learn in a way that does not dishonor the celestial beings that give us our very lives.</string>

  <string id="123420">Since I keep forgeting where I put everything the night before, I&apos;m writing this checklist to myself... to help get me through mornings.

1. Do you have your axes? If not, you&apos;re probably dead.
2. Do you have your clothes? Are you wearing them? If you don&apos;t see your clothes nearby, you&apos;ll probably never find them, so don&apos;t waste time looking. If you really need clothes for some reason, take what you need from the nearest dead bodies.
3. Are you in a bed? Is there someone with you? I&apos;ve learned from past mistakes, waking up with someone usually turns out badly. Get your clothes and leave quietly.
4. Is anyone still alive nearby? Don&apos;t be shocked. Sometimes I pass out before I start fighting. Since the people nearby probably won&apos;t be up for a fight for some time, it&apos;s best just to move on and find another place to stay for the day.</string>

To Kill a Spirit

A wise monk once asked, &quot;How can you kill a thing that is already dead?&quot; The answer is simple: You cannot. You can, however, disperse a spirit. This is not the same as killing, but it has a similar effect. It is important to remember that spirits are virtually immune to man-made weapons. You must confront spirits with martial, magic, or transformation styles. Never underestimate the strength of spirits. They may appear insubstantial, but they can still be deadly to the living.</string>

Being a collection of the indignities suffered by Minister Sheng at the hands of the backward shanty town of Tien&apos;s Landing: 

His hat has been soiled.
A parchment was stolen from him before a speech at a community gathering.
His cat was viciously threatened.
A chair at his table was placed backward.
His finger was slammed in a door not once, but thrice.
An egg was thrown at him by an unknown assailant.

It was suggested that he perform acts of deliberate indecency upon himself.
He was forced to suffer the interminable and petty gripes of the people.
His hair was accused of being impermanent and false.
The honor of his family was impugned.
He suffered a disabling attack by a pack of bees. 
His reputation was maligned by brigands. Brigands!
A local dog evacuated in the Minister&apos;s shoe. 
He was given a gift of turtle eggs by a visiting merchant.
It was suggested that he would be able to trace his lineage to a simple courtesan.
He was referred to as &quot;smelly.&quot;
He slipped in mud, no doubt placed in his path by jealous townsfolk.
Sailors burned down his office.</string>
