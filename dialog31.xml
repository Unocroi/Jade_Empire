  <string id="113695">
The pride, perfection, and achievement of an individual are represented in many ways: the honing of the mind, civic achievements and glory gained for the Empire, the development of the spirit and one&apos;s inner energies, and the training of the body. Through the body the practitioner imposes his will upon himself and, through that, upon the universe. Through use of his body, the martial artist achieves transcendence and strength, overcoming all obstacles, both physical and spiritual.</string>

The great Wheel of Life turns eternal, bringing one through life, into death, then back around again into life. Though the new life is always different, the core essence, the spirit, of a person remains the same. This spirit, breathed into each person, is eternal. To achieve harmony with the universe, one must perfect their harmony with the spirit. Indeed, the spirit in each individual is a reflection of that greater universe. It is a reflection of the Wheel of Life and the Great Dragon that created it.</string>

  <string id="114100" soundid="173609">Well, two actually, but you need to choose which one you&apos;ll take. Master Li wants you to stay focused on your first weapon.</string>
  <string id="114101" soundid="173610">Anything? *Everything.*</string>
  <string id="114102" soundid="173611">I don&apos;t know where your master acquired these, but he has honored me with the care of two legendary weapons.</string>
  <string id="114103" soundid="173612">You may arm yourself with either the legendary long sword, Fortune&apos;s Favorite, or the famed staff, Golden Star.</string>
  <string id="114104" soundid="173613">They say this blade was created in the forge of Smiling Fortune, blacksmith to the gods. Crafted for his son, this blade eventually found its way into the hands of men.</string>
  <string id="114105" soundid="173614">How your master found it, I cannot say, but this ancient long sword is yours if you wish it.</string>
  <string id="114106" soundid="173615">They say Golden Star was forged as a gift to a water spirit of the Silkworm River.</string>
  <string id="114107" soundid="173616">A young noble convinced the Great Eastern Serpent to fly him to the stars, where he dipped this staff in the tail of a comet.</string>
  <string id="114108" soundid="173617">It could be pure fantasy, but this staff certainly isn&apos;t. It&apos;s strong and has an excellent reach. Your foes will tremble if they see you wielding it.</string>
  <string id="114109" soundid="173618">One more thing you need to know. These weapons strike with deadly precision, but to wield them safely you must focus with each strike.</string>
  <string id="114110" soundid="173619">Master Li has been training you so that you&apos;d be ready for this kind of weapon, and the drain won&apos;t be crippling, but you will get tired over time.</string>
  <string id="114111" soundid="173620">I&apos;m afraid not. She would not be able to handle one of these weapons quite yet.</string>
  <string id="114112" soundid="173621">I&apos;ll explain why in a moment, but suffice it to say that very few people have your aptitude for maintaining focus in battle.</string>
  <string id="114113" soundid="173622">In time, Dawn Star will be able to handle a weapon like this, but don&apos;t discount the blade I gave her. Master Li wanted her to have the keenest steel I could find.</string>
  <string id="114115" soundid="173624">A monk&apos;s spade is a deadly adaptation of a simple tool. It&apos;s a graceful weapon, wielded like a staff, but with a bladed end. Most deadly.</string>
  <string id="114116" soundid="173625">This monk&apos;s spade is ancient, and some say it was even used by our first Emperor, Sagacious Tien. Whether that&apos;s true or not, this is a fine, fine weapon.</string>
  <string id="114124" soundid="173633">Not that I can recall, but Gujin, there are already bandits here in Two Rivers!</string>
  <string id="114125" soundid="173634">In something of a foul mood, are we? Nothing you can do to cheer her up, Dawn Star?</string>
  <string id="114126" soundid="173635">Not right now, Gujin! There&apos;s already bandits here in Two Rivers!</string>
  <string id="114127" soundid="173636">You know you came here with Master Li as just a babe. I came not long after, and I&apos;ve been holding onto a weapon for you ever since.</string>
  <string id="114129">Where did Master Li find these weapons?</string>
  <string id="114130">Is there anything special about these weapons?</string>
  <string id="114193">Tell me about the long sword, Fortune&apos;s Favorite.</string>
  <string id="114195">I will take Fortune&apos;s Favorite.</string>
  <string id="114196">Let me hear about the staff, Golden Star.</string>
  <string id="114199">I will take Golden Star.</string>

  <string id="114728" soundid="174352">Hmm... somewhere near one. I disregard the designs each time.</string>
  <string id="114729" soundid="174353">I thought the smaller flyers were earlier versions of the Dragonfly. Are you saying that you built this one without reference and just labeled it &quot;better?&quot;</string>
  <string id="114730" soundid="174354">Flyers are a product of inspiration. You don&apos;t glorify the new form by reusing parts or ideas. The Dragonfly is safe because I made it safe.</string>
  <string id="114731" soundid="174355">Besides, if the danger increased as you went back, that begs the existence of some primal contraption so perilous only the void beyond the heavens can hold it.</string>
  <string id="114734">A valid concern. Kang, what precautions have you made for safety?</string>
  <string id="114737">I don&apos;t care, it works well enough as it is.</string>
  <string id="114739">How do you make improvements if you start fresh each time?</string>
  <string id="114744">Everyone quiet. Silk Fox, please mind your tone.</string>
  <string id="114745">That&apos;s enough everyone. Dawn Star, I&apos;m sure Silk Fox meant no insult.</string>
  <string id="114746">Heavens help us, the Black Whirlwind has the best understanding of the situation.</string>
  <string id="114749">Let them fight, Zu. Brains and brawn, the epic struggle.</string>

Upon the Plain of Barren Hope roam the tribes of the Horselords, vicious nomads who frequently raid the borders of the Empire. These nomads are raised from birth in the saddle of their horses and can ride them as if the two were part of the same animal. Indeed, one of their chief gods, a vicious half-horse warrior, combines both of these aspects. He wields a composite recurve bow and a light cavalry lance. Philosophers debate whether the horselords themselves take their weapons from their god or their god took them as his own after seen the successes his people had with them.</string>

A collection of logs, notes and records maintained by the Yun family up until roughly fifteen years ago. One entry catches your eye.

&quot;My son seems utterly disinterested in the temple, and I worry that he pays no attention to the lessons I try to impart. The key, of course, remains in knowing that the seasons which most affect a forest are summer and winter, and the colors associated with these two seasons. If I am right and my lessons fly from his head as quickly as they can, then I fear for his safety should he attempt the ritual incorrectly. These furnaces are an ancient magic, and ancient magics draw dark attentions.&quot;

Another note, entered a bit later, reads, &quot;As I feared, my son pays little heed. Perhaps I will install something to remind him. Violet is not our family color, but I hope it can be a potent reminder.&quot;</string>

  <string id="115395">The Use of the Spear</string>
  <string id="115396">
The spear is the deadliest of weapons in the hands of a master. No other weapon can compare. Its length and reach allow a skilled user to strike with impunity from a distance, far from any retaliation, while the power of its strike is formidable. All the user&apos;s energy is focused on one tiny little point, allowing him to strike with blinding speed and punch through almost any armor. Additionally, the force with which an enemy approaches the user may be turned against him, adding to the power of the thrust. This is doubly valuable against a mounted enemy.</string>
  <string id="115397">The Hidden Leaf</string>
  <string id="115398">
In the Year of the Thousand Axes, there arose a warrior of such power and skill that none of his enemies, even champions of the Empire, could face him. He was Leaf. He was not a bloody man, and he disdained fighting for its own sake. He was the protector of a section of the Great Southern Forest. His duty was not to enforce law or order in his domain, but to protect something hidden, something secret, farther in the forest. It is not known what it was he was guarding, for one day he simply disappeared. Challenges went unanswered, and logging gradually reduced that section of the forest to fields.</string>
  <string id="115399">Text of War</string>
  <string id="115400">
In the art of war, it is not enough to have superiority in numbers, or strength in arms. True victory, lasting victory, is a cultural thing. To stop a conflict, you must not only defeat armies, you must defeat the will to fight. You must appease your enemy, convince them they have won, or eradicate them utterly. A nation with an expansive population, therefore, benefits from extermination. With a surplus of peasants, a newly cleared land can be rapidly repopulated, and, with an infrastructure of buildings already in place, made productive in short order. In the reign of Emperor Yuan Xi this was demonstrated most admirably in the marshlands to the south.</string>

  <string id="115462">Horse Lord Tactics</string>
  <string id="115463">
Unlike the ordered armies of the Jade Empire, the Horselords favor lightly armored units of horsemen, who can move rapidly over the field of battle. Moving like a rushing tide, small groups of horsemen harry all angles of their opponents&apos; flanks. Armed with bows, almost to a man, these mounted archers can rain destruction upon unprepared foes. While the Horselord tactics are surprisingly effective, their men lack the discipline of the Imperial Army; for all the damage they can inflict the horselord forces have difficulty holding strategic locations. For now, the Jade Empire exists in an uneasy peace with the Horselords, leaving the savages to their arid lands north of the Seat of Heaven Province.</string>
  <string id="115464">The Tricksters</string>
  <string id="115465">
The fox spirits are among the most wily and deceptive of all the minions of heaven. They think nothing of playing games with mortals, and they often follow no rules at all. Though some are said to serve honorably in the Celestial Bureaucracy, many more have made their mark in more sinister ways. Tales of demons snatching children from their beds, husbands and wives led astray, and good men led into lives of excess and murderous depravity are all the work of these spirits. Never, should you value your life, trust one of this breed completely, no matter how honorable their intentions seem.</string>
  <string id="115466">The Old Tongue, Vol. 1</string>
  <string id="115467">
&quot;Tho Fan,&quot; or The Old Tongue, was the native language of one of many kingdoms struggling for supremacy before the Empire was unified by Sagacious Tien, our first Emperor. As the wars raged, constant shifts in territorial leadership spread the use of the Old Tongue. By the time Sagacious Tien formed the Empire, the Old Tongue was so widely spread that it became a second official language of the Jade Empire.</string>
  <string id="115468">The Old Tongue, Vol. 2</string>
  <string id="115469">
There is no word in the Old Tongue for language. It merely is. There is no word for their people, since all of the original speakers of that language were &quot;the people.&quot; The closest word they had was &quot;us.&quot; Similarly, their word for their homeland was the same word they applied to the entire world.

In time, the true center of the world, the Jade Empire, emerged and breached the mountain surrounding this isolated civilization. As is often the case, savages cannot understand the benefits of a superior culture and must be forcibly educated in it for their own good. The wisdom of the emperors prevailed, and those people joined the growing Jade Empire.</string>
  <string id="115470">The Old Tongue, Vol. 3</string>
  <string id="115471">
The speakers of Tho Fan joyfully took to their new status as people of the Empire. After a small period of persecution, they became equals in our grand design and part of our glorious destiny. Indeed, they became such an integral part of the Empire that they spread to every corner of it, focusing mainly in the south and the Prosperous East. 

The Old Tongue became the second language of the Empire over the subsequent centuries and is spoken nearly everywhere. Indeed, most citizens of the Empire can understand and speak all the major languages, and even some of the regional dialects, with ease. The language reforms of Empress Heavenly Flower gave all citizens a common written language, which applied equally to all major tongues. In this way, centuries later, all who can read and write are understood everywhere in the Empire.</string>
  <string id="115472">The Celestial Order, Vol. 1</string>
  <string id="115473">
The world is a place of order. When order is not enforced, chaos reigns. Chaos is the natural state of the world. The order that currently exists is the result of the power of the Great Dragon. Out of this streaming chaos, the Great Dragon created the world, perfect in every way. But nature, the forces of the universe, demand balance. For every bit of order, there must be corresponding chaos. That first world, that perfect world, was pure order. It could not last.

The perfect order choked life and did not allow growth, and so chaos was allowed back into the world.</string>
  <string id="115474">The Celestial Order, Vol. 2</string>
  <string id="115475">
The Great Dragon loosed chaos upon the world he had created, separating man from the beasts and laying the foundation for the eventual order that would unite humanity: this glorious Jade Empire. The great animal spirits of the past were cast out from the human communities, and Man was forever separated and elevated above the common beasts. Man was now the guardian of order, imposing his will on nature and shaping it to his desire.

But balance must exist in all things. Man was a bastion of order, with chaos in his heart. For as long as the world remains in chaos, man will always war and strive against his fellow man. This is the way of nature. Until the Great Dragon returns to bring the world to order or humanity brings itself above the cycle of nature, this is the way it will always be.</string>
  <string id="115476">The Celestial Order, Vol. 3</string>
  <string id="115477">
The Celestial Bureaucracy is made up of all the servants that the Great Dragon left behind to administer creation. According to the priests and augers, they know nothing of their creator or where it has gone. The Great Dragon has transcended heaven, they say. They, in their faithfulness, remain behind.

Or so they say. Over the millennia, many have fallen from their duties and have become part of the chaos in the world. This, we can only suppose, is part of creation as well. But as representatives of order, humanity suffers most from the attentions of these chaotic spirits and demons.</string>
  <string id="115478">The Nature of the Spirit, Vol. 1</string>
  <string id="115479">
Mankind has long known that we are not alone in this world. Descended from heaven, risen from the ground, present all around us are spirits. These beings often go unseen, but when they choose to interact with us, the effect is usually profound. But what are these beings? Are they people who have died? Are they servants created at the beginning of the world by the Great Dragon? Are they something else entirely? Or are they all of the above?

In my research I have managed to find and communicate with a number of them. I contacted some through priests or relatives, when it was a spirit returned from the dead. But other encounters were much stranger.</string>
  <string id="115480">The Nature of the Spirit, Vol. 2</string>
  <string id="115481">
One encounter brought vividly to mind was deep in a mine along the ridges near the Land of Howling Spirits. I was searching for a spirit I had seen the previous day, a spirit of moss and fungus that dwelt in this abandoned mine. Years earlier the mines were so prosperous that several communities depended on them for their livelihood, but collapses, fires, and unexplained disappearances in the mines led people to become more and more fearful of them. A local monk ventured in one night after hearing a disturbance, and he was never seen again. Thereafter, miners repeatedly reported hearing screams in the deepest tunnels in the voice of that young monk.</string>
  <string id="115482">The Nature of the Spirit, Vol. 3</string>
  <string id="115483">
The folktales surrounding the disappearance of the monk did not disturb me. The mines had been inactive for a century or more, and the surrounding villages had long since decayed. Any spirit that fed upon humans or human emotion or pain would have left in search of easier prey. Or so I had thought.

As I searched for the moss spirit that had brought me to the depths of that mine, I began to wonder if the legends were true after all. If the spirit or whatever it was that had driven away the miners could reside there still. In my mind, I began to hear the whispers in the dark and the screams and cries of those who lost their lives ages ago.</string>
  <string id="115484">The Nature of the Spirit, Vol. 4</string>
  <string id="115485">
It is said in the journals of the lost monks of the Jinzhi sect that there are spirits of every desire. By summoning that desire within themselves, men can commune with the spirit, summoning it to them. I can&apos;t imagine what kind of spirit must have been summoned in the dank of that mine. Darkness on all sides, only the slight flickering of that lamp. A great unknowable fear welled up within me. Those ancient monks knew too much, I think. They communed with their own dark desires too often. In that place, I, too, faced my fears. The circumstance and research that led me to that point scarcely prepared me for what I faced. The Dweller in the Depths spoke to me.</string>
  <string id="115486">The Nature of the Spirit, Vol. 5</string>
  <string id="115487">
It is clear to me now what manner of creatures these spirits are, and it is also clear what their goals are. For all that their lies portray them to be, the Celestial Bureaucracy is nothing more than the subjugation of man by the eternal beings of that court. The Dweller has shown me many things, many dark and terrible truths I could not have seen before, but which are clear to me now.

When I return, I know what they will say. The Emperor, the one closest to heaven, is their tool, their puppet. I know they will send him against me, fearing the power of my knowledge. Oh yes, I know. They will burn my works, but I must make copies, as the Dweller said, spreading my dark knowledge far enough that it will never be destroyed.

Remember this, reader: To a spirit, any spirit, the life of a human is worthless. We are tools and toys for their amusement alone.</string>
  <string id="115488">Music and the Arts</string>
  <string id="115489">
Music and the other arts are vital parts of life in the Jade Empire. As with any truly civilized people, even the common man can enjoy the benefits of music in his daily life. Only the music of the Jade Empire itself truly satiates this primal urge. The lesser, more savage peoples that surround us know nothing of true culture, and their primitive beatings and wailing cannot touch the soul as truly as have the masterpieces of Water Swallow or the heart-wrenching tragedy of Falling Star. For this reason, if not others, it is our duty as a cultured people to bring civilization and joy of the arts to those less advanced and gifted societies.</string>
  <string id="115490">Perception</string>
  <string id="115491">
What do you see? Is it what you think? Or is that just what you want to think? Isn&apos;t it much more pleasant to always see what you like, rather than what you don&apos;t? Would it be that much of a problem? Why not always view the world as perfect, discarding this tedious, fragile mortal shell for the bliss of the mind? This is the power that some spirits can offer. True enlightenment, true freedom from guilt and fear and the shackles of daily life. The priests and officials tell you that spirits are only there to tempt and steal and inflict pain, but that is part of *their* vision. It is their way of controlling you. The spirits are not our enemies, they are our saviors. Only by accepting their vision as truth can we be free.</string>

  <string id="115595">You encountered two masters involved in a game of yi, a strategic game in which white and black pieces struggle to control territory on a board. It seems their games extend to the world around them, as both have offered to train you in their style, but only if you can prove that you follow one of their competing philosophies.</string>

Knowing one&apos;s proper place in the order of creation is a step toward enlightenment. Accepting one&apos;s place and fulfilling one&apos;s own purpose leads to greater resolve and strength. This gem has been in the hands of people who know that order brings peace, both inner and outer. A like-minded individual can draw strength from it.

Some realize that to be a productive member of society one must set aside one&apos;s own selfishness and greed. One must band with others of a like mind to achieve the best possible, not for one&apos;s self, but for the greater whole. The solidarity of heroes flows through this gem, empowering the wielder with their purpose.

No matter what a person&apos;s path in life, fate, destiny, and human desire decide how far one goes. Whether on a path of peace or of power, the will must exist in balance with the needs of the body, the mind, and the spirit. When all are one, then true mastery can be achieved. This gem allows its wielder to balance the forces within, strengthening the whole.</string>

When one is at peace, one can achieve a form of transcendence. The goal of every true master and every true scholar is to surpass the physical form and unite one with one&apos;s own spirit. In that moment of transcendence, all limits fall away, and a person can perform at levels never before thought possible. </string>

This gem makes its wielder capable of great physical feats that are normally only possible with years of training. The sudden improvement to the user&apos;s physical abilities disrupts inner balance, however, and so the gem also siphons essence from its wielder&apos;s spiritual and mental capabilities, weakening those aspects to fuel the wearer&apos;s unyielding body.</string>

This gem imparts great wisdom and mental abilities to its wearer, but it teaches a lesson of its own: that great and sudden power is only available at a great price. The wielder&apos;s mental capacity is greatly strengthened, but at the cost of his or her physical and spiritual abilities.</string>

The first victor of the Imperial Arena was the supremely cunning and vicious Gao Mahn. Undefeated for 15 years, he earned the lasting favor of the people and the Emperor himself. In recognition of his deeds, he was given wealth, property and this gem. Unfortunately, warriors cannot adjust to peace easily, and he soon squandered his prizes and reportedly died of a very conspicuous illness in a waterfront whorehouse.</string>

A musician who traveled the breadth of the Empire was once the owner of this gem. He carried it with him for years. His fame spread ahead of him, and he was welcomed in all corners of the Empire. No one knows what became of him, for Imperial Edict erased his legacy for crimes unknown. Surely, despite his other obvious strengths, he must have committed some folly that secured his downfall.</string>

The Grandfather River flows through the Empire, taking with it a tale of years too long for human memory. Sailors of merchant vessels on the river speak of the ghost of a woman crying out in agony. She has been named the Grandfather&apos;s Daughter. Only once has she come ashore, and legends say she left behind a single tear in the form a gem. Every single owner of that gem, as the legends go, has felt her pain and sorrow throughout his life, his body wracked by pain but his mind and spirit made sharper by its clarity.</string>

In the reign of the Empress Sun Lin, arts flourished, especially dancing and poetry. The Empress surrounded herself with beautiful young women, masters in their respective art forms. The most admired, and most talked about was the dancer called the Divine Rose. When the Empress&apos; life was cut short, Divine Rose was heartbroken and wept for days, dying from grief shortly thereafter. Legends say that her tears of grief are what gave power to this gem, imbuing it both with her grief and with her passion.</string>

Master Gambler Wu Pin was the scourge of betting houses across the Empire. Rumor has it that one would never know he was present until it was too late, because he would always lose every single game until the very end, when he would reach into his pocket and finger his lucky gem, which would bolster his intuition and bring him victory in the final, and most expensive, gamble.</string>

The Yung family was well respected in the Imperial City and had a tradition of dedicating their lives to public service. They served as town guards and city officials for many generations. They were renowned for their force of personality, able to get what they wanted from others through reputation and physical presence. Passed down from father to son through each generation was an heirloom, a simple gem that was always prominently worn. The gem, Gentle Persuasion, was eventually gambled away by an unlucky heir, and the fates conspired to disgrace the family shortly after.</string>

Protector Lo Wan was an enforcer for an openly secret society that offered &quot;protection&quot; to merchants and citizens throughout the Empire. In return for regular payments, the surprising number of &quot;accidents&quot; that occur were greatly reduced. Coincidentally, these &quot;accidents&quot; often occurred in the presence of Protector Lo Wan, and he became very persuasive in getting more business for his organization. As his star rose, so did his tastes. His penchant for gaudy jewelry eventually led to his acquiring this gem, and, at the time of his death at the hands of a crowd of angry merchants, some of his skill was imprinted in it.</string>

One of the reasons behind the formation of the Order of the Lotus was the potential influence of a rising priesthood. The personal magnetism and radiance of the Priestess Wu Lin made her an object of desire and near-worship throughout the Empire. In the hands of one with less devotion to the Empire, these powers of persuasion could have had a disastrous effect on the balance of power in the land. For this reason, members of the Order of the Lotus wore featureless masks so that their physical blessings would not give them too much power.</string>

Never has a man or woman had greater fortune than a lowly farmer named Jun Bin. His mother gave him an amulet on the day of his birth, and he only removed it at the end of his life. He never knew misfortune and, indeed, could not understand it when others tried to explain it to him. He was kind but distracted, neither loved nor hated. The evils and ills of the world just never touched him, as if he was always in exactly the right place to avoid danger and harm. Such goes against the order of the Heavens, though, and the one time he removed the amulet, the Heavens struck him down.</string>
  <string id="116000" soundid="175981">Ha! That&apos;s the way. Keep showing that kind of spirit and you might just survive.</string>
  <string id="116001" soundid="175982">Ha! Luck will have nothing to do with it.</string>
  <string id="116002" soundid="175983">No spine in the children born in this wet time, Vo. None at all.</string>
  <string id="116003" soundid="175984">You know as well as I that this one was born at the end of the Long Drought, Jian.</string>
  <string id="116004" soundid="175985">Yes, there is that. Well, at least you had the gumption to test yourself against me without hesitation. Let us return to our game. My &quot;pupil&quot; will return later, I&apos;m sure.</string>
  <string id="116005" soundid="175986">You begin to understand what I have to teach, but I do not think you yet understand enough of the Way of the Closed Fist.</string>
  <string id="116006" soundid="175987">Continue to broaden your understanding of the Way, and I will consider you. For now, I will not.</string>
  <string id="116007" soundid="175988">You do not seek my training. You understand nothing of the Way of the Closed Fist</string>
  <string id="116008" soundid="175989">Perhaps you should talk to my counterpart. She would likely coddle your adherence to the weak Way of the Open Palm.</string>

  <string id="116022" soundid="176003">Impress me and show me that you understand more than the basics of the Way of the Closed Fist, and I will consider teaching you the mysteries of Tempest.</string>

  <string id="116024" soundid="176005">If we had a board with us, it would be easier to turn away, but Mistress Vo and I have long since moved past needing such novelties.</string>
  <string id="116025" soundid="176006">Yi is played on a board marked with nineteen horizontal and vertical lines. The objective is to place a series of stones to control the most territory by the game&apos;s end.</string>
  <string id="116026" soundid="176007">It is an ancient game, known by many names, but we prefer to call it by one of its oldest monikers.</string>
  <string id="116027" soundid="176008">You should learn it sometime. It helps to focus the mind and to understand that every action must have a purpose.</string>
  <string id="116028" soundid="176009">Desperation, mostly. Neither Vo nor I have the time to carry around our boards, or the exquisite slate pieces. Our lives are too full of battle to risk such things.</string>
  <string id="116029" soundid="176010">So we have learned to make this a contest of the mind. To hold the game at the front of our thoughts.</string>
  <string id="116030" soundid="176011">How long has it been since I realized what a fool you are, Jian?</string>
  <string id="116031" soundid="176012">Pfaw! Thirty years ago, you decided to embrace &quot;harmony.&quot; Why did I teach you anything, I wonder?</string>
  <string id="116032" soundid="176013">Because you saw potential in me, the same way I now see potential in you. The Way of the Closed Fist must become a tiring way to live at your age, Jian.</string>
  <string id="116033" soundid="176014">Come back when you feel you understand the Way of the Closed Fist. I might consider teaching you a little something, if you do.</string>
