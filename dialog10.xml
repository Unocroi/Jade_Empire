  <string id="45624" soundid="138332">What if I guarantee your name will live in the heart of each and every citizen in the Jade Empire?  It is a glory beyond mere heroics. You would be eternal.</string>
  <string id="45625" soundid="138333">I do not seek power as my brother did. I will correct the violence inherent in Man. I will make certain there are no more wars, no more droughts.</string>
  <string id="45626" soundid="138334">Everyone will be content in their roles. And they will hold in their hearts the warrior who sacrificed everything so that they might prosper. You could make that happen.</string>

  <string id="45629" soundid="138337">Your name will forever be lauded. In the end, is that not the only immortality worth having?</string>
  <string id="45633" soundid="138338">Forever. Not a man, woman, or child will go a day without acknowledging your sacrifice. Many have struggled for utopia; you will be the heart of it.</string>

  <string id="45635" soundid="138340">Then let it be done. You give yourself to a far greater glory than you could ever know.</string>

  <string id="45637" soundid="138342">Tell me, what use are heirs to a god? I will set the Empire on a path of never-ending stability and glory. I am beyond this.</string>
  <string id="45638" soundid="138343">That it was Dawn Star only reinforces this truth. I would have recognized her, had I cared to. What use are heirs to a god?</string>
  <string id="45639" soundid="138344">Ah, so even *you* know when to cast aside those who have moved beyond usefulness. Then you understand why you, too, must fall.</string>
  <string id="45640">I&apos;m listening.</string>
  <string id="45643">I will be eternal anyway. The power is mine when you die!</string>
  <string id="45645">I fall, but my name lives on forever? Why would I agree?</string>
  <string id="45647">Forever remembered as a hero by all?</string>
  <string id="45648">Then I agree.</string>
  <string id="45649">No, you will not win. Let&apos;s end this. Master versus student.</string>
  <string id="45650">For the Jade Empire and the name of &lt;FullName&gt;, I agree.</string>
  <string id="45653">She deserves better. I can&apos;t allow this.</string>

  <string id="45979" soundid="55246">These soldiers passed through my village a few weeks ago. One of them angered the Lotus Assassin who was in charge, and the Assassin killed him!</string>
  <string id="45980" soundid="55247">As I was coming back in from the fields, they grabbed me to fill his place. They put this uniform on me--blood stains and all--and told me I was in the army! </string>
  <string id="45981">If you are frightened, we are probably not meant to be.</string>
  <string id="45982">You cling to traditions that should be left behind. Clearly you want more. I can provide that.</string>
  <string id="45985">I admire your respect for tradition, even as it holds you back from what you want.</string>

  <string id="45987">It is merely a game. You toy with me; I toy with you.</string>

  <string id="46006">Perhaps it is not meant to be. What do you say to that, Silk Fox?</string>
  <string id="46007">Go. Leave here, and never return.</string>
  <string id="46008">You&apos;re of no more use to me. Time to die.</string>
  <string id="46009">You wear the uniform of the Imperial Army.</string>
  <string id="46011">Answer my questions if you want to live.</string>
  <string id="46013">Lying cur! You die now!</string>
  <string id="46016">When we take control? That&apos;s different than just exposing Death&apos;s Hand.</string>
  <string id="46022">[Intuition] If you don&apos;t demand what you want, despite the consequences, you cannot claim it is worthwhile.</string>

  <string id="46205">To find Master Li and Death&apos;s Hand, you must make your way to the Pirate Lair. Only Ru the Boatswain can take you there. You found Ru and convinced him to take you there. He will wait for you by his small pier in Tien&apos;s Landing.</string>

  <string id="46216" soundid="165536">Yes, I hunt Gao the Greater, though I will not say why. It is a personal matter.</string>
  <string id="46217" soundid="165537">I will not say. Not until Gao the Greater has paid in full.</string>
  <string id="46218" soundid="165538">I won&apos;t be stopped now that I&apos;m this close, and luckily you&apos;re here. That will make it easier to reach the upper levels where he hides himself away.</string>
  <string id="46219" soundid="165539">As I said, Gao the Greater took something valuable from me, and he deserves to have that favor repaid.</string>
  <string id="46220">You are off to the palace with Silk Fox to confront her father, Emperor Sun Hai.</string>
  <string id="46221" soundid="165540">A good question. It&apos;s always wise to be on your guard in places like this. Rest assured, I have no intention of harming you.</string>
  <string id="46222" soundid="165541">You&apos;re here for your reasons and I&apos;m here for mine. Somehow, I doubt they conflict. Besides, we&apos;ll need each other&apos;s help to get through that door.</string>
  <string id="46236" soundid="127427">Ah, Miss Chan. A tragedy, really, and one that happens all too often. It&apos;s always the pretty ones who go.</string>
  <string id="46237">Captain Ing offered a reward to whoever could close the Great Dam, allowing his ship to leave the Beggar&apos;s Pier. You destroyed the Great Dam, trapping Captain Ing and his men in Tien&apos;s Landing.</string>
  <string id="46238" soundid="62644"></string>
  <string id="46239" soundid="62645">Stranger, forgive me for being so forward, but if you are wise you will turn around and leave this cursed and miserable town.</string>
  <string id="46240">On Beggar&apos;s Pier in Tien&apos;s Landing, Captain Ing offered a reward to whomever could close the Great Dam. You closed the Great Dam and collected your reward from a grateful Captain Ing.</string>
  <string id="46241" soundid="62646">Mother and I are getting out of this town. If you have any sense, you&apos;ll do the same.</string>
  <string id="46242" soundid="62647">Hush, daughter! You must treat strangers with respect. Once we are outside of town, we must be very careful with everyone we meet.</string>
  <string id="46254" soundid="126727">There are several customers who owe me money, but with the dam open, times are hard. I can&apos;t expect them to pay me when they can&apos;t even feed their families.</string>
  <string id="46255" soundid="126728">And if they don&apos;t pay me, I can&apos;t afford the raw materials to make my woodwork. It&apos;s a difficult situation, but I&apos;m trying to make the best of it.</string>
  <string id="46256" soundid="126729">No, no. That won&apos;t be necessary. I don&apos;t want to cause any trouble for my customers. I&apos;m sure they&apos;ll pay me eventually. At least, I hope so.</string>
  <string id="46257">The Forest Shadow is destroyed, and her influence over the forest has been removed. Without it, the forest will never recover from its twisted corruption.</string>
  <string id="46258">The Forest Shadow has agreed to temporarily remove her influence over the forest in the hopes that this will lure whatever corruption dwells within the inn into revealing itself.</string>
  <string id="46259">Investigating the temple proved to be fruitless, as a black wall blocks your path into its inner chambers. Perhaps the missing hunter knows something more, if he&apos;s even still alive.</string>
  <string id="46260">You have found hunter Shau, and he&apos;s clinging to a gem which precipitated the attack at the temple. If you could get a hold of it, perhaps you can lure the creature that attacked you out of hiding.</string>
  <string id="46261">The demon that attacked you has fled into the temple and disappeared after recovering from your assault. Clearly this will take more drastic measures to resolve.</string>
  <string id="46263">The inn&apos;s patrons and staff barely seem human any more, and there is no sign of Lord Yun or his retinue. </string>
  <string id="46264">The inn&apos;s patrons and staff barely seem human any more, and there is no sign of Lord Yun or his retinue.</string>
  <string id="46265">Henpecked Hou has told you about a large series of caves beneath this inn. With the front doors sealed, it seems there&apos;s only one possible route for escape.</string>
  <string id="46266">The cannibal master was not what he seemed. A loutish warrior being kept to act as consort for something called &quot;The Mother,&quot; he has joined you and opened a path to another cave deeper in the warren.</string>
  <string id="46268">You have cleansed the temple, and Chai Ka has opened a gate for your passage to the realm of the creature that attacked you. According to your follower, though, she is no demon, but actually a spirit of this forest.</string>
  <string id="46269">You have defeated the demon known as the Cannibal Mother and eliminated her taint on the both the forest and the Pilgrim&apos;s Rest Inn. With the spirit&apos;s help, the Great Southern Forest will quickly recover from its corruption.</string>
  <string id="46270">You have defeated the demon known as the Cannibal Mother and wiped out the Cannibals infesting the Inn. Her influence will be felt for generations, though. With the Forest Shadow dead, this forest will always remain a dark and twisted place.</string>
  <string id="46271">It seems this forest is trapping all who enter its borders. A hunter has asked for your help in escaping, and suggested that you talk to Lord Yun, the noble responsible for the Great Southern Forest, at the Pilgrim&apos;s Rest Inn.</string>
  <string id="46272">You have found and spoken to Lord Yun. He is willing to help you reach the Imperial City, but will be unable to aid you until you find a way to open the forest again.</string>
  <string id="46273">You have discovered that the true source of the forest&apos;s corruption lies in the Pilgrim&apos;s Rest Inn. If it can be dealt with, a path to the Imperial City may yet open up.</string>
  <string id="46274">You have returned to the inn only to be attacked by a group of sub-human creatures. There is no sign of Lord Yun or his proposed aid to reach the Imperial City, but there are strange noises coming from below the inn.</string>
  <string id="46275">You have escaped from the caves and defeated the &quot;mother&quot; of the cannibals. The forest should open, but you still lack a wind map, and it would be an awfully long walk to the Imperial City.</string>
  <string id="46276">Using the Lotus Assassin&apos;s wind maps, you have escaped the Great Southern Forest.</string>
  <string id="46277" soundid="126730">You might be right. I&apos;m a fine craftsman, but I&apos;m not much for business. I extend credit too easily, and then I can&apos;t bring myself to collect. It&apos;s just not in my nature.</string>
  <string id="46278" soundid="126731">A noble offer, but I must refuse. Prospects for my shop are poor right now. I can&apos;t allow you to risk losing your investment. No, things will have to work out on their own.</string>
  <string id="46279" soundid="126732">No, no. I&apos;m nobody. You don&apos;t want to talk to me. You should speak to Minister Sheng. He&apos;s much more important than a simple merchant about to go out of business.</string>

  <string id="47088">This will be your last breath.</string>
  <string id="47089">No one gets away from me!</string>
  <string id="47090">Fight fast. Fight dirty.</string>
  <string id="47091">You won&apos;t be able to beat me!</string>
  <string id="47092">This is your final fight.</string>
  <string id="47097">I can&apos;t be beaten like that.</string>
  <string id="47098">That... that was a dirty trick.</string>
  <string id="47099">Now you&apos;re feeling pain!</string>
  <string id="47114" soundid="56695"></string>
  <string id="47115" soundid="56696"></string>
  <string id="47116" soundid="56697"></string>
  <string id="47117" soundid="154206">I don&apos;t really remember what happened next. I might have passed out. No one&apos;s ever threatened me before!</string>
  <string id="47119" soundid="154208">Women! That&apos;s the one I forgot? I must be getting sober if I&apos;m forgetting that one.</string>
  <string id="47120" soundid="156036">He fought like a monster... for a little guy.</string>
  <string id="47121" soundid="156037">Better than I&apos;ve been in a while. All this &quot;best behavior when you&apos;re in the city&quot; business was wearing on my nerves.</string>
  <string id="47122" soundid="156038">Good point, but he was particularly plucky. It&apos;s nice when they stick around longer so you can practice your moves.</string>
  <string id="47125" soundid="156039">Not the first time I&apos;ve gone up against one of Kai Lan&apos;s thugs, you know. Not at all.</string>
  <string id="47126" soundid="156040">That&apos;s unfair! These axes don&apos;t sharpen themselves, you know.</string>
  <string id="47127" soundid="156041">Remember I told you I used to fight in the arena? Well, I was the best there was, then my brother came to the city and decided he&apos;d join the arena too.</string>
  <string id="47128" soundid="156042">The arena was about the same as it is now. Qui and Kai Lan were there, and Lucky Cho, too, but he was just a runt back then.</string>
  <string id="47130" soundid="154219">I did some harsh things while with the Lotus Assassins, but they no longer follow a path I recognize. They are a mirror of Death&apos;s Hand, and he embodies corruption.</string>
  <string id="47131" soundid="154220">You will see, as you get close to him. He draws out the worst in everyone and displays it for all to see.</string>
  <string id="47132" soundid="154221">Ignorance does not make truth go away, it only hides it. Perhaps we will talk again when I see more of where your path will lead you.</string>
  <string id="47133" soundid="154222">You have no concept of the devotion of his followers. Perhaps we will talk again when I see more of where your path will lead you.</string>
  <string id="47134" soundid="154223">The Princess has offered an exchange for passage to the palace. I do not agree with what she is asking, but it may be your only option.</string>
  <string id="47135" soundid="154224">You say that as if I wander the street randomly murdering. No, most trigger the end of their lives through their own action. My participation is mere formality.</string>
  <string id="47136" soundid="154225">They are as powerful as fear allows them to be. Not the specific information you are looking for, I&apos;m sure, but you did ask about my *feelings.*</string>
  <string id="47137" soundid="154226">If their tactics have not changed, everyone fears them as children fear the shadows, never knowing what might come.</string>
  <string id="47138" soundid="154227">They are not outlaws! Their orders come from Death&apos;s Hand, and he is the will of the Emperor!</string>
  <string id="47139" soundid="154228">At least, that is how it was meant to be. Pardon my outburst. Every act of the Assassins has the approval of the Emperor. We were supposed to reflect his glory.</string>
  <string id="47140" soundid="154229">That is why some actions... should never have been ordered.</string>
  <string id="47141" soundid="154230">The Lotus Assassins were once the Order of the Lotus under Prince Kin, spiritual advisor to the Emperor. During and after the attack on Dirge... changes were made.</string>
  <string id="47142" soundid="154231">As flames seared the sky, enemies of the Emperor faced a new threat... Death&apos;s Hand. He assumed command of our order, and we began silencing people.</string>
  <string id="47143" soundid="154232">Some were killed only to serve as warnings. Others... others had done nothing except be near his enemies.</string>
  <string id="47147" soundid="154233">I am no stranger to death. That alone is not enough to disturb me. But I see only weakness in targeting innocents... peripheral to the real enemy.</string>
  <string id="47148" soundid="154234">Weakness suggests losing the right to rule. Can you see how that shook my faith in the Empire? You seem to see why I had concerns... perhaps you might understand.</string>
  <string id="47149" soundid="154235">I have not said everything, and I have not yet decided if I will, but I see something in you that may set things right. We will see. For now, what else do you need?</string>
  <string id="47150" soundid="154236">I see. Your interpretation of &quot;the Way,&quot; or &quot;the low road,&quot; or whatever you choose to call it, allows the killing of those that have not earned their fate?</string>
  <string id="47151" soundid="154237">Strength is a tool meant to be used, but to murder the families of opponents you cannot reach, people once close to you... I see no strength in that.</string>
  <string id="47152" soundid="154238">I don&apos;t think you would make good use of what I know. I will continue to assist you, but my secrets will remain my own. I have nothing else to say.</string>
  <string id="47153" soundid="154239">If that is all the thought you intend to put forward, I will reveal nothing more of what I know, aside from what will assist in the short term.</string>
  <string id="47154" soundid="154240">You would not make honorable use of anything I might say. Now, if you are done dismissing me, we should continue to the Imperial City.</string>
  <string id="47155" soundid="154241">You don&apos;t strike me as the kind who would make honorable use of what I would say, anyway.</string>
  <string id="47156" soundid="154242">It is a foolish idea. You do not understand the seductive nature of the Assassins and what they do to recruits. </string>
  <string id="47157" soundid="154243">It does not take much to make a person forget who they are. With a little effort, they can be pushed past any morals they might have claimed.</string>
  <string id="47158" soundid="154244">Cloaked in service and honor, even the most depraved of barbarity soon becomes unremarkable.</string>
  <string id="47159" soundid="154245">A naive assumption. Perhaps you can avoid direct participation, but their fanaticism will still affect you. The rot that is Death&apos;s Hand permeates the complex.</string>
  <string id="47160" soundid="154246">Perhaps you think so, but the enemy is fanatical. The rot begins high up, and it is embodied in the shell that is Death&apos;s Hand.</string>
  <string id="47163" soundid="154247">He was made our leader during the razing of Dirge. He replaced Sun Kin, who, along with the Glorious Strategist, never returned from that campaign.</string>
  <string id="47164" soundid="154248">I did not serve Death&apos;s Hand long, but when the orders came, he never questioned. The connection is more direct than loyalty... and he instills that in his Lotus Assassins.</string>
  <string id="47165" soundid="154249">That is how so many were driven to kill without cause, and why I decided no more.</string>
  <string id="47167" soundid="154250">There was more to that event--you are right to sense it--but I have kept my silence for so long that I must carefully consider the repercussions of breaking it.</string>
  <string id="47168" soundid="154251">I don&apos;t seek justification. There is more to that event than I have said, but I have kept silent for so long that  I must carefully consider the repercussions of speaking.</string>
  <string id="47169" soundid="154252">I must inevitably deal with my demons. Your destiny demands it. But I must also know that those demons will be put to rest, not exploited.</string>
  <string id="47170" soundid="154253">For many years, I did nothing. If I had known Master Li was the Glorious Strategist, so much could have been resolved, one way or another.</string>
  <string id="47171" soundid="154254">In the end, I will have to trust that you are enough his student to find a way to protect what I cannot.</string>
  <string id="47172" soundid="154255">So you claim. I am not accustomed to words having such weight. We should... we should resume your mission. You have far to go.</string>
  <string id="47173" soundid="154256">I suppose you are. I am with you, and we will see what comes. Let&apos;s get back to your mission. We have far to go.</string>
  <string id="47176">I see nothing in what they do that would scare off a killer like you.</string>
  <string id="47179">I have no further interest in your riddles, Zu.</string>
  <string id="47183">They sound more like outlaws than an arm of the Emperor.</string>
  <string id="47187" soundid="56836"></string>
  <string id="47188" soundid="56837"></string>
  <string id="47189" soundid="56838"></string>
  <string id="47190" soundid="56839">You look so peaceful, even though I know that what you&apos;ve been through must have been terrible.</string>
  <string id="47192" soundid="56841">Yes, it is, isn&apos;t it?</string>
  <string id="47193" soundid="56842">But tomorrow that will be gone... shattered. The time we have now may never come again.</string>
  <string id="47194" soundid="56843">The time we have left is small. I wonder sometimes... I wonder what I would do if I knew that I would lose you tomorrow.</string>
  <string id="47195" soundid="56844">And then I remember that I have already lost you once, and I could never suffer that pain again.</string>
