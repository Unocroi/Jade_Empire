  <string id="70946">Horse Demons

Words are only wasted describing these equine horrors, for their appearances are all too easily recalled from the nightmares of childhood. All the legends talk of these beasts&apos; fiery manes and terrifying strength, but few sources delve beyond the lore to seek out the fact. It was a most fortunate happenstance that led this author into a roadside discussion with the venerable Li Shi Tun, a master warrior who had recently destroyed one of these beasts. His insight proved most valuable, for it was this master who first made clear the true effect of the horse demon&apos;s terrifying mane. Holding out blistered hands, the ancient warrior made his point most clearly: to strike a creature who controls elemental fires with such ease is to strike the flame itself. One must be prepared to hurt themselves with each attack.</string>

This blade is claimed by two legends, one from the Prosperous East and one from the Golden Delta. In the first, a flower girl was wronged by an official, and an outlaw incited revenge for his own purposes. Trapping the official, the woman beat him savagely with a bouquet of roses, the thorns raking eyes and skin. An observing fox spirit frowned on hatred abusing such beauty, and transformed the flowers into a sword. The official was killed, leaving the woman to ponder the hardening of her heart. In the second tale, the outlaw instead urged restraint and suggested asking the river for guidance. A golden carp answered the woman&apos;s plea and, as it swam by, the sun on its scales took the shape of a blade that fell in the shallows at her feet. She took up arms in the spirit of justice and order was restored. Stories--and people--change with the influence that others bring.</string>
  <string id="70951">Weapon Style, Artifact Weapon
+25% Damage Over Basic Long Sword Style

The story of the Broken Bough is a sad page in the history of the Jade Empire. When Emperor Zuwan, ninth emperor in the time of divisions, died suddenly with no heir, his wife, Seng Si, assumed the throne to prevent chaos. Though respected, she was seen as merely a ceremonial caretaker. When war erupted a decade later the Imperial Army would not follow her orders, so she took up a sword and asked instead that they follow her lead. Emperors lead armies only in legends; Seng Si&apos;s commitment stunned her detractors, and her death shamed the nation. Seng Si the Broken Bough changed the face of the Imperial court, though the relics of her rule were never displayed.</string>

Maker&apos;s Bane was forged from a falling star that tore from the heavens as the Celestial Dragon shaped the world. The loss of life resulting from its use is thoroughly predictable.

Placid Guiju is a sepulcher for the God of Agricultural Poetry. Guiju of Words and Land transformed into a plowshare to aid the workers of the Golden Delta, but was trapped when the farmers remade their tools into weapons to repel invading Horselords. Pounding plowshare to sword might have held ironic appeal, but being an axe causes injury to Guiju&apos;s poetic sensibilities. The effectiveness of this blade is agony for his gentle spirit, an insult that will eventually destroy him and strip &quot;field verse&quot; from the Lexicon of the Ages. It also makes the wielder slightly giddy.</string>

  <string id="71528" soundid="96866">That ogre didn&apos;t stand a chance!</string>
  <string id="71529" soundid="96867">You&apos;re so close to facing the Ravager! Don&apos;t give up now.</string>
  <string id="71530" soundid="96868">I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll find a way to bounce back.</string>
  <string id="71531" soundid="96869">I can&apos;t wait for the next fight to start.</string>
  <string id="71532" soundid="96870">I hear Qui the Promoter&apos;s got some new types of fights lined up.</string>
  <string id="71533" soundid="96871">The Emperor used to attend these matches, but he stopped coming years ago.</string>
  <string id="71534" soundid="96872">I follow all the fighters&apos; careers.</string>
  <string id="71535" soundid="96873">I should go home, but I really want to watch the next fight.</string>
  <string id="71536" soundid="96874">You&apos;re going to tear through the qualifiers. I can just tell.</string>
  <string id="71537" soundid="96875">You will go far in the Bronze Division. I look forward to seeing you face Crimson Khana.</string>
  <string id="71538" soundid="96876">You were a sure thing in my eyes.</string>
  <string id="71539" soundid="96877">Khana collapsing was just further proof of how weak she was.</string>
  <string id="71542" soundid="104917">I don&apos;t think we will be referring to you as a &quot;student&quot; much longer. You dealt with those bandits easily enough.</string>
  <string id="71547" soundid="96885">&quot;Khana&apos;s unbeaten streak ends now,&quot; I told myself.</string>
  <string id="71550" soundid="96888">Soldier will be getting nervous at the pace you&apos;re advancing.</string>
  <string id="71551" soundid="96889">I knew Soldier was losing his edge! He couldn&apos;t stay Silver Division champion forever.</string>
  <string id="71552" soundid="96890">You&apos;re going to do very well in the Gold Round, I can feel it.</string>
  <string id="71553" soundid="96891">The Imperial Engagement merely cemented in my mind that you will be our new champion.</string>
  <string id="71554" soundid="96892">Honor is yours, champion. I knew it would be, in time.</string>
  <string id="71555" soundid="96893">Your last match looked painful.</string>
  <string id="71556" soundid="96894">An ogre is no mean foe. Don&apos;t underestimate him and you&apos;ll be fine.</string>
  <string id="71557" soundid="96895">Even in the lower divisions, victory is never a sure thing.</string>
  <string id="71558" soundid="96896">The Bronze Division fights are more difficult than the highest levels of most tournaments.</string>
  <string id="71559" soundid="96897">You need to keep your wits about you to fight in the Silver Division, there&apos;s no denying it.</string>
  <string id="71573" soundid="96911">That last one was a win for you, was it?</string>
  <string id="71574" soundid="96912">I could have sworn the ogre was due for a win. Oh well, there&apos;s more silver into Lucky Cho&apos;s pocket.</string>
  <string id="71575" soundid="96913">Ha! See, I *was* right! You didn&apos;t win. I&apos;ll never doubt the system again.</string>
  <string id="71576" soundid="96914">I could have bought a nice farm in the south if I&apos;d played my cards right.</string>
  <string id="71577" soundid="96915">I can feel it. Today&apos;s going to be my lucky day.</string>
  <string id="71578" soundid="96916">Okay, I can do this. I can pick a winner, I know it!</string>
  <string id="71579" soundid="96917">Surely someone around here will front me a few silvers, just to break this cold streak.</string>
  <string id="71580" soundid="96918">Since my wife left me, I&apos;ve had a lot more time to track the trends in the ring.</string>
  <string id="71581" soundid="96919">You wouldn&apos;t have any hot tips for me, would you? No, no one ever does.</string>
  <string id="71582" soundid="96920">Most new qualifiers don&apos;t progress like you. You&apos;re not making me any money here.</string>
  <string id="71583" soundid="96921">Could you try to be less... good? My bets will bankrupt me again if you keep this up!</string>
  <string id="71584" soundid="96922">I thought Khana was a sure thing.</string>
  <string id="71585" soundid="96923">Then she keels over and dies. Just my luck! I had thirty of my cousin&apos;s silvers on her too!</string>
  <string id="71590" soundid="99443">Since you moved past the Silver Division, things have been too hectic for us to keep an eye on anything. Soldier&apos;s less concerned with the arena&apos;s politics these days anyway.</string>
  <string id="71591" soundid="99444">I keep an eye on the new blood, and I like to see what the Guild&apos;s up to. Kai Lan the Serpent&apos;s men are all agitated since Lucky Cho&apos;s death.</string>
  <string id="71592" soundid="99445">New fighters, like yourself. I also try to keep tabs on what Kai Lan the Serpent and his goon Lucky Cho are up to.</string>
  <string id="71593" soundid="96931">Just my luck that she&apos;d lose! I had thirty of my cousin&apos;s silvers on her too!</string>
  <string id="71594" soundid="99446">Kai Lan&apos;s the real power behind this place. He&apos;s affiliated with the Guild, a criminal organization. I don&apos;t know much about them besides that.</string>
  <string id="71595" soundid="99447">If the larger organization&apos;s anything like the Serpent&apos;s, they&apos;re power hungry maniacs. Kai Lan flaunts his power and corruption. He&apos;s not a man you want to cross.</string>
  <string id="71596" soundid="96934">You can&apos;t possibly keep doing this well for long. Soon, all my bets against you will pay off!</string>
  <string id="71597" soundid="96935">Why do you insist on ruining me? How much silver must I pour upon your opponents before one of them wins at the right time?</string>
  <string id="71598" soundid="96936">Lost a lot on that one. Luckily some large, well dressed fellows were willing to lend me some more silver. That reminds me! I should look up that &quot;dismemberment&quot; word they used....</string>
  <string id="71599" soundid="96937">I had a lot of money riding on you. Well, more on everyone else, but you were key to me finally making a profit!</string>
  <string id="71600" soundid="96938">Bah! I should just stop betting. Care to wager 5 silvers that I can&apos;t last a day? </string>
  <string id="71601" soundid="96939">Why didn&apos;t I bet for your last match?</string>
  <string id="71602" soundid="96940">I&apos;ll just bide my time. Plenty of chances to collect on what I sense will be a grand losing streak!</string>
  <string id="71603" soundid="96941">That&apos;s okay, I&apos;ll put twice as much on the rematch. It&apos;s a sure thing that you&apos;ll lose!</string>
  <string id="71604" soundid="96942">I could have sworn you were due for a win, and my system says wagering for you is a fool&apos;s gambit.</string>
  <string id="71605" soundid="96943">I should have known you weren&apos;t going to win that last one. Stupid of me, so stupid!</string>
  <string id="71609" soundid="99449">People talk to Lucky Cho if they want to bet big on one of the fights. He won&apos;t take silver from you if you&apos;re a fighter or he doesn&apos;t know you very well, however.</string>
  <string id="71610" soundid="99450">Cho collects on his bets the hardest way possible. It&apos;s a bad idea to cross him. Feel free to test his patience if you don&apos;t believe me.</string>
  <string id="71611" soundid="99451">What do you want to talk about?</string>
  <string id="71612" soundid="99452">I help him any way he needs me to. I&apos;m even starting to learn some of his styles, though I&apos;m a long way from his skill. Not many can match him.</string>
  <string id="71613" soundid="99453">Let&apos;s say that my treatment methods are more unorthodox than Doctor An&apos;s, but no less effective.</string>
  <string id="71614" soundid="99454">They&apos;re much more enjoyable as well. You&apos;ll never find out, though. I don&apos;t waste my time on young men. You&apos;re all too... excitable.</string>
  <string id="71615" soundid="99455">They&apos;re also much more enjoyable for us both.</string>
  <string id="71616" soundid="99456">Fine by me.</string>

  <string id="71675" soundid="99488">There&apos;s a ghost under my bed. He whispers to me all night. Then I&apos;m sleepy in the morning.</string>
  <string id="71676" soundid="99489">Mommy says the Emperor forgot about us, and Daddy gets mad.</string>
  <string id="71677" soundid="99490">I knew this boy who drowned in the river. Now he scratches my door at night.</string>
  <string id="71678" soundid="99491">Have you ever seen a ghost? The little ones are meaner.</string>
  <string id="71682">Neither. I want something else.</string>

  <string id="72098" soundid="97717">I taught Iron Soldier everything he knows, and he didn&apos;t pay attention to half, so you should be just fine in your next match.</string>
  <string id="72100" soundid="97719">I was wondering when we&apos;d come to the point. You&apos;re up to face Iron Soldier next, aren&apos;t you? He&apos;s tried this little trick before.</string>

  <string id="72103" soundid="97722">One of them went on to greater things. The other.... well, I hope he found peace in the water as I do.</string>
  <string id="72104" soundid="97723">I&apos;m sure Soldier told you he was dishonorably discharged, and he blames me for that. I am to blame, so that&apos;s fair.</string>
  <string id="72105" soundid="97724">He forgets that, without my intervention, he would have been beheaded on the spot. I wouldn&apos;t have stepped in had I known it would condemn him to a life of bitter rage.</string>
  <string id="72107" soundid="97726">Iron Soldier, a brash youth far under my command at the time, struck a Lotus Assassin in the face.</string>
  <string id="72108" soundid="97727">He disagreed with orders to slaughter a small northern village. Its citizens were unjustly accused of harboring criminals who were plotting to murder the Emperor.</string>
  <string id="72109" soundid="97728">The Assassin demanded Soldier&apos;s head, and I refused. What Soldier did was wrong; why he did it was not.</string>
  <string id="72110" soundid="97729">General Stone Kao pleads for nothing. If you are my end, I meet you as an honorable opponent.</string>
  <string id="72111" soundid="97730">Things have grown worse with the Imperial Army. The Lotus Assassins control everything now. I was the last to oppose them, and I am lucky to be retired instead of dead.</string>

  <string id="72117" soundid="97736">Tell me, if you&apos;ve changed your mind, would you be up for a friendly match? Not to the death, just until one of us falls over wheezing?</string>
  <string id="72118" soundid="97737">Really? This is a treat. Not everyone gets to face one of the arena&apos;s champions! Let&apos;s see if I can still remember a few of the old forms.</string>
  <string id="72119" soundid="97738">A shame. There was no harm in asking. Go back to Soldier and face him honorably. He&apos;ll learn his lesson eventually.</string>
  <string id="72120" soundid="97739">I greet you as well.</string>
  <string id="72121" soundid="97740">I have no family left, cur. They were in the village that Soldier tried to save. They burned under the assassins&apos; orders.</string>

  <string id="72141">Do you have time to answer a few questions for me?</string>
  <string id="72142">I should go.</string>
  <string id="72148">Door</string>
  <string id="72151">What happened to the other two?</string>
  <string id="72152">Soldier didn&apos;t mention that there were two others.</string>
  <string id="72156">What was his crime?</string>
  <string id="72157">It sounds like you denied him an honorable death.</string>
  <string id="72161">Why did you spare him from the assassins?</string>
  <string id="72162">Now you plead for your life with this little story?</string>
  <string id="72166">I won&apos;t fight you.</string>
  <string id="72167">Soldier didn&apos;t tell me the whole story.</string>
  <string id="72169">I want no part of your death.</string>
  <string id="72171">It would be an honor, General.</string>
  <string id="72173">I don&apos;t really have the time.</string>
  <string id="72174">I greet you as my honored opponent.</string>
  <string id="72175">Please press your Fight Style keys to map this style to the chosen direction. </string>
  <string id="72178">Take me to the men who are hiding first. They&apos;re in for a surprise.</string>
  <string id="72180" soundid="136227">We can&apos;t let the Inscrutable Power Source fall into enemy hands! You hold her off!</string>
  <string id="72181">Talk to Sheng</string>
  <string id="72184">Return to Tien&apos;s Landing and tell Minister Sheng that the dam is closed.</string>
  <string id="72204">I have my own silver. You are not above personal sales, are you?</string>
  <string id="72240" soundid="136294">Passing through? So you intend to head north? I&apos;m sorry to say, but that simply won&apos;t work.</string>
  <string id="72241" soundid="136295">Besides, I think I have some old family business to catch up on. Old alliances to re-forge, as it were.</string>
  <string id="72242" soundid="136296">I&apos;ve been in this forest long enough that it was very clear when she died. The air...changed. There&apos;s really no other way to describe it.</string>
  <string id="72243" soundid="136297">I&apos;m sure you made the right decision and did what needed to be done. I know the trees won&apos;t heal for some time, but that&apos;s to be expected.</string>
  <string id="72244" soundid="136298">As I said, the Forest Shadow herself informed me of your brave actions.</string>
  <string id="72245" soundid="136299">It was a lucky moment when you walked into this place. Fortunate for us both, in fact.</string>
  <string id="72246" soundid="136300">Indeed, it is. You have my deepest gratitude. I had virtually given up hope, and you appeared like a gift from the heavens.</string>
  <string id="72247" soundid="136301">Farewell. That map will carry you safely if you can find a flyer with the range. I wish you all the best of luck.</string>
  <string id="72249">How did you know I cured your forest?</string>
  <string id="72252">I think it&apos;s time I left.</string>
  <string id="72254">No particular reason. I&apos;m simply passing through.</string>
  <string id="72256">Just tell me what you need me to do.</string>
  <string id="72260">There is a problem with a data file. You may need to reinstall the game. Press OK to continue.</string>
  <string id="72262">Several flyers are heading for Two Rivers, and it is unlikely their presence is a coincidence. You must get back to town as quickly as you can.</string>
  <string id="72263" soundid="136317">I am so very sorry. You must accept my apologies; he is uncontrollable sometimes.</string>
  <string id="72264" soundid="136318">Keep your apologies! That was amazing! Spear Catches Leaf is no warrior. He doesn&apos;t understand the thrill of victory!</string>
  <string id="72266" soundid="136320">Disturbing. It truly is.</string>
  <string id="72267" soundid="136321">It&apos;s an unnatural blackness that develops on their bark. I noticed it some months ago and it spread like wildfire. It is like nothing I have ever seen before.</string>
  <string id="72269">TUTORIAL</string>
  <string id="72270" soundid="136324">Yes, and why so many? Why here? Rare souls occasionally wander from the path to the underworld but the forest is full of them. Perhaps it&apos;s tied to the Forest Shadow.</string>
  <string id="72272">I already know him. Let&apos;s talk about what you can do for me.</string>
  <string id="72273">Exit to City</string>
  <string id="72274">I&apos;ve already talked to him, thanks. I should be going.</string>
  <string id="72277" soundid="136331">Odd. Could the missing crystal be tied to her aggression? Perhaps if we can reach her, we can find the answers.</string>
  <string id="72278" soundid="136332">You were there to witness it and yet survived. This is very strange indeed. If we can reach her, we can find some answers, though we will have to be careful.</string>
  <string id="72280" soundid="136334">You&apos;ve just had the... unexpected honor of defeating the Black Whirlwind, the self-styled deadliest mercenary in the Jade Empire.</string>
  <string id="72281" soundid="136335">I thought you were a ghost. Wasn&apos;t that clear? Ha! And people say I&apos;m slow.</string>
  <string id="72282" soundid="136336">Does she look at all like she&apos;s dead? No! No mask, not floating, clearly not a ghost. You simply wanted a challenge. You are an idiot. A deadly, drunken idiot.</string>
  <string id="72283" soundid="136337">Does this look anything like a ghost? Is he floating, or missing parts, or anything along those lines? No. You are an idiot. A deadly, drunken idiot.</string>
  <string id="72284" soundid="136338">What&apos;s wrong with being deadly... or drunk? You may be a lead hunter for some lord, but I&apos;m the deadliest mercenary in the world. You do your job, and I&apos;ll do mine.</string>
  <string id="72285" soundid="136339">There&apos;s dozens of them, but if you didn&apos;t recognize me right away, you must not have heard them.</string>
  <string id="72286" soundid="136340">Now really isn&apos;t the time to share them. I&apos;d need about five bowls of wine and a soft patch of ground to even get started.</string>
  <string id="72287" soundid="189541"></string>
  <string id="72290" soundid="136344">She is an ancient fox spirit who has always stood guardian over these woods. But now ghosts gather, the trees grow sick, and she seems powerless to stop any of it.</string>
  <string id="72293" soundid="136347">I still find the news of her attack disturbing. I can see why you&apos;d be leery of her, but I can&apos;t help but think there&apos;s another reason.</string>
  <string id="72294" soundid="136348">An attack? That&apos;s... that&apos;s not right. She&apos;s never been known to attack anyone. I&apos;ve hunted this forest on my Lord&apos;s behalf for a decade and had no trouble.</string>
  <string id="72297">Would one of you please explain why I was attacked?</string>
  <string id="72301">What earns a mercenary a title like &quot;deadliest?&quot;</string>
  <string id="72302">Are there any stories of your exploits I would know?</string>
  <string id="72305">Forget about the attack. If you&apos;re Spear Catches Leaf, we need to talk.</string>
  <string id="72308">Let&apos;s talk about the Forest Shadow.</string>
  <string id="72311">Why would the Forest Shadow attack me?</string>
  <string id="72312">Tell me more about the disease affecting the trees.</string>
  <string id="72314">&lt;CUSTOM0&gt; XP</string>
  <string id="72315">Why are the ghosts gathering here?</string>
  <string id="72318">That&apos;s enough about the Forest Shadow.</string>
  <string id="72319">Tell me more about this ritual.</string>
  <string id="72320">I need your Lord&apos;s wind map. Let&apos;s figure out what needs to be done.</string>
  <string id="72323">The man was attacked and killed by the Forest Shadow.</string>
  <string id="72334">Yifong&apos;s daughter, Fuyao has been captured by pirates. She is powerless to deal with these brutal men. Find Fuyao and rescue her from the pirates.</string>

  <string id="72494" soundid="136724">The crystal is yours, but remember our deal.</string>
  <string id="72495">Master Li turned on you in your moment of triumph. You awake in a strange spirit world, no longer among the living. The Water Dragon is calling, drawing you in the direction of a beacon of light. Hopefully she can explain your present condition.</string>
  <string id="72496" soundid="136726">She spoke of your... encounter. She regrets attacking you and considers it a mistake.</string>
  <string id="72497" soundid="136727">She said you would seek to confront her. Go to the upper islands and do so, but know that not all in the forest is as it seems.</string>
  <string id="72498" soundid="136728">I will say no more. Your answers wait with the Forest Shadow.</string>
  <string id="72499">Why did your mistress attack me?</string>
  <string id="72501">What do you mean by that cryptic statement?</string>
  <string id="72503">Stunning Kick</string>
  <string id="72515">You blocked my attack!</string>
  <string id="72516" soundid="136763">That&apos;s...almost too incredible to believe, but then, so is the rapid disease and the number of ghosts here.</string>
  <string id="72517" soundid="136764">I can accept that. I can also appreciate what you have gone through. I have a feeling this forest was beyond my abilities to cure.</string>
  <string id="72518" soundid="136765">It seems a shame. Yet, looking around this place, I would have to wonder what kind of people could survive for months surrounded by blight and the dead.</string>
  <string id="72519" soundid="136766">I shall trust that you did what had to be done. The air certainly seems fresher since you&apos;ve returned. Perhaps this forest will heal after all.</string>
  <string id="72520" soundid="136767">They&apos;re all right, then? I wouldn&apos;t have expected that after being isolated here for so long.</string>
  <string id="72521" soundid="136768">Caves? Oh, yes I remember that there was a tiny storage cavern below the inn. I suppose there could be still more.</string>
  <string id="72522" soundid="136769">We may very well do that, and soon. Yes, we should take them supplies and food and see if there&apos;s anything else we can do to help them.</string>
  <string id="72523" soundid="136770">True enough. The forest is cured, it seems. If they&apos;ve survived this long, things will only get easier for them.</string>
  <string id="72524" soundid="136771">True. I should focus on more important matters. There will be some work ahead of me.</string>
  <string id="72525" soundid="136772">It doesn&apos;t really matter. I shall deal with the inn in time and see for myself.</string>
  <string id="72526" soundid="136773">One thing I have been meaning to ask you, though. What of the Pilgrim&apos;s Rest? Spear Catches Leaf mentioned that you went there to retrieve the crystal.</string>
  <string id="72527" soundid="136774">How do they fare in that place?</string>
  <string id="72528" soundid="136775">What? All of them dead? That&apos;s terrible!</string>
  <string id="72529">They&apos;re all dead. Your forest was home to more than the fox spirit.</string>
  <string id="72530">They were cannibals, serving an ancient demon.</string>
  <string id="72532">You don&apos;t need the details. Just accept that it had to be done.</string>
  <string id="72534">They died for the right reason.</string>
  <string id="72537">You should go and see. They&apos;d love to have you.</string>
  <string id="72538">There&apos;s no one left at the inn. They might have retreated to the caves.</string>
  <string id="72539">You should make your way up there.</string>
  <string id="72541">You have other things to worry about. Leave the inn to its own devices.</string>
  <string id="72543">Your forest is cured, that&apos;s all that matters.</string>
  <string id="72545">Looking after your inn wasn&apos;t part of our agreement.</string>
  <string id="72548" soundid="136795">The set of steps on the north side open to a path that curves to a clearing. From that clearing, the inn&apos;s gateway is clearly visible on the far side.</string>
  <string id="72549">How do I get to the inn?</string>
  <string id="72550" soundid="136797">Find Spear Catches Leaf at the temple above and see what he has learned. Your wind map will be waiting when you find a cure.</string>
  <string id="72552" soundid="136799">You have reached her? This is exceptionally good news! Did you have... any problems?</string>
  <string id="72553" soundid="136800">Demonic magic? That seems incredible, but in this setting I have no choice but to believe you.</string>
  <string id="72554" soundid="136801">Good. Though I am not a &quot;believer&quot; in spiritual matters, I think she is our best hope in this matter.</string>
  <string id="72555" soundid="136802">I would say it is *our* business, but I will trust that you know what you are doing.</string>
  <string id="72556" soundid="136803">If she is not the cause of this forest&apos;s corruption, I hope she told you what must be done. Help her in any way you can, and the wind map will be yours.</string>
  <string id="72557">I have talked with the Forest Shadow.</string>
  <string id="72558">There is a demon corrupting your forest.</string>
  <string id="72560">I have agreed to help her.</string>
  <string id="72562">That is my business.</string>
  <string id="72568" soundid="136817">The ghosts attack everyone! They are mad with...madness! Thank you for keeping me safe.</string>
  <string id="72571" soundid="154557">I am your death, mortal!</string>
  <string id="72577" soundid="143811">That repulsive... I wish I&apos;d known ahead of time. You know, before he hit me.</string>
  <string id="72581" soundid="136843">Will you? Even if you could, I believe you would find it difficult to release so valuable a tool.</string>
  <string id="72582" soundid="136844">Come, then, pit your will against mine. Take him if you can.</string>
  <string id="72583" soundid="186299">Time is better spent doing than talking.</string>
  <string id="72584" soundid="136846">RRRRAAAAAGHHH!</string>
  <string id="72586" soundid="136848">Will you? I wonder why you oppose me when you are so willing to assume my methods.</string>
  <string id="72587" soundid="136849">Enough! You have cut the strings to my puppet, but you will know defeat soon enough. I grow closer to the heavens by the minute.</string>
  <string id="72588" soundid="136850">Take this corpse. See if you can throw away such a useful tool. I will face you at the height of my power, in the heart of *my* Empire.</string>
  <string id="72589" soundid="136851">Your master awaits you, child.</string>
  <string id="72590" soundid="136852"></string>
  <string id="72591" soundid="136853">Please, let me rest. Let my spirit finally have some peace.</string>
  <string id="72592" soundid="136854">Do not step down that low road. This is a mockery of life. Step back from the path my brothers took. That I took.</string>
  <string id="72593" soundid="136855">Know this, Spirit Monk. You walk a path very near that of your Master. Both lead to power, but the cost cannot be avoided!</string>
  <string id="72594" soundid="136856">Know this, Spirit Monk! There are prices to pay!</string>
  <string id="72596" soundid="136858">Your Master is diminished with my loss, even if he does not admit it.</string>
  <string id="72597" soundid="136859">Thank you, Spirit Monk, for letting me rest.</string>
  <string id="72603" soundid="98284">We&apos;ve met before, how could I forget?</string>
  <string id="72604" soundid="98285">We haven&apos;t talked, but I&apos;ve been admiring you from afar ever since your match with Khana.</string>
  <string id="72605" soundid="98286">Here&apos;s the deal. I like you. The way you &quot;dealt&quot; with Khana showed me that you have the will to do what it takes to win. I know a way you and I can both win in this upcoming fight.</string>
  <string id="72606" soundid="98287">A deal, between two people who know how this place *really* works.</string>
  <string id="72607" soundid="98288">No, I&apos;m trying to find a way to benefit from losing it.</string>
  <string id="72608" soundid="98289">No, but you&apos;re too smart to not hear me out.</string>
  <string id="72609" soundid="98290">This is a one-time offer. You listen to it, or you walk away now, and it never comes up again. Sure you want to throw that away so easily?</string>
  <string id="72610" soundid="98291">You know people place bets on the arena fights all the time, right? Things used to go through Lucky Cho. With him dead, the smaller fish are trying to make the big play.</string>
  <string id="72611" soundid="98292">Everyone knows the match between us is coming up. You&apos;re good, but the odds say I&apos;m better. This is our chance, while everything&apos;s in chaos.</string>
  <string id="72612" soundid="98293">I want to place a bet--on you--big enough that I&apos;ll be able to get out of this place whenever I want. If I&apos;m going to lose my title, I deserve that at least.</string>
  <string id="72613" soundid="98294">After what you did to Khana--that arrogant bitch--I can&apos;t think of anyone I&apos;d rather take my place. The Silver champion has to be hard to stay there.</string>
  <string id="72614" soundid="98295">You do me a favor, and I&apos;ll cut you in for twenty five percent of what Li-Li wins when she places the bet for us. During the fight, I take a dive and we both end the day happy and rich.</string>
  <string id="72615" soundid="98296">You&apos;re going to win, and Qui gives you shiny coins when you win. I&apos;m going to lose. This keeps things even.</string>
  <string id="72616" soundid="98297">I&apos;m not open to negotiation on this. That&apos;s a fair number.</string>
  <string id="72617" soundid="98298">Khana was gunning for Silver when you took her out. Ended her smug little unbeaten streak, didn&apos;t you?</string>
  <string id="72618" soundid="98299">Qui&apos;s too weak to do anything about it, and no one else would care except the Serpent. Much of the bet money makes its way into his hands anyway.</string>
  <string id="72619" soundid="98300">From what I hear, you&apos;re not exactly in good with the big man, so I doubt you&apos;d be allowed to see him. Even if you were, I don&apos;t think he&apos;d be inclined to trust you. </string>
  <string id="72620" soundid="98301">I want you to find General Stone Kao. He&apos;s here in the city somewhere.</string>
  <string id="72621" soundid="98302">When you find him, challenge him to a duel to the death. The old fool&apos;s too proud to decline, even though his skills have over the years.</string>
  <string id="72622" soundid="98303">I hear that he was granted a new blade by the higher-ups to commemorate his retirement. I want no piece of the Army, so it&apos;s yours if you defeat him.</string>
  <string id="72623" soundid="98304">I hear word that he&apos;s dead before our match, and I take the dive. It&apos;s that simple.</string>
  <string id="72624" soundid="98305">He&apos;s the one who had me thrown out of the Imperial Army. I&apos;m glad he did now, but he still deserves to pay for the indignity.</string>
  <string id="72625" soundid="98306">I don&apos;t want to talk about it, and it doesn&apos;t matter.</string>
  <string id="72626" soundid="98307">I&apos;m not a pushover like the others. I&apos;d go down fighting, and if you ask me, I won&apos;t be the one clutching myself on the pit floor when all&apos;s said and done.</string>
  <string id="72627" soundid="98308">If you want to take that chance, you can, but I&apos;m offering you a chance to make extra coin and make our match a sure thing.</string>
  <string id="72628" soundid="98309">You don&apos;t have one. Life&apos;s like that. Think about it sensibly, though, and you&apos;ll see that this is my way out, and a chance for me to get rich.</string>
  <string id="72629" soundid="98310">Better still, I get to see my division go to someone I respect and who&apos;s got the guts to protect it like I did, no matter what it takes. That means a lot to me.</string>
  <string id="72630" soundid="98311">No, it&apos;s not. When I hear that General Stone Kao has breathed his last, then it will be a deal. </string>
  <string id="72631" soundid="98312">When you&apos;ve dealt with that old tiger, you come back, talk to me, and I&apos;ll give Qui the go ahead to set up our fight. It&apos;s that easy.</string>
  <string id="72632" soundid="98313">I just wanted to give you a slice of the action; now I&apos;ll have to give you a slice of pain. Go cry to Qui when you&apos;re ready, and I&apos;ll see you in there!</string>
  <string id="72633" soundid="98314">I know why you&apos;re here.</string>
  <string id="72634" soundid="98315">We&apos;re not fighting yet, though. We made a deal. I&apos;ll hear about it if the General loses his duel to you. Now go find him. He&apos;s somewhere out in the city.</string>
  <string id="72650">Sounds interesting. What do you have in mind?</string>
  <string id="72652">You&apos;re just trying to find a way to save your championship.</string>
  <string id="72654">I have no reason to trust you.</string>
  <string id="72656">Don&apos;t even start, Soldier. You&apos;re going down and nothing will change that.</string>
  <string id="72657">Tell me. I&apos;m listening.</string>
  <string id="72660">Why me?</string>
  <string id="72661">How do I benefit from this?</string>
  <string id="72663">Only twenty five percent?</string>
  <string id="72665">Why did you hate Khana so much?</string>
  <string id="72666">What if I told people you were planning to take a dive?</string>
  <string id="72668">I&apos;m still waiting to hear the catch. What&apos;s the favor?</string>
  <string id="72672">Why do you want this general dead?</string>
  <string id="72673">Why were you thrown out?</string>
  <string id="72674">It sounds like it would be easier to just face you normally.</string>
  <string id="72676">What guarantee do I have that you will stick to this?</string>
  <string id="72678">It&apos;s a deal.</string>
  <string id="72680">I&apos;m not interested. See you in the ring.</string>
  <string id="72684" soundid="105709">Should we get started now, or did you need to review how the fight works?</string>
  <string id="72685" soundid="105710">Ask away. It is your right to know what you face.</string>
  <string id="72686">I want to ask a few things about this fight first.</string>

  <string id="72934" soundid="135119">They were good people. Their love for each other was matched only by their devotion to the Water Dragon herself.</string>
  <string id="72935" soundid="135120">Had they survived, you would have been raised here in Dirge. You would have been instructed from birth in the duties of a Spirit Monk. It is a tragedy you never knew them.</string>
  <string id="72936" soundid="135121">We served the Water Dragon as her guardians and protectors.  We saw to the needs of her physical form, maintained Dirge, and honored her with worship and prayer.</string>
  <string id="72937" soundid="135122">We also served as shepherds for the dead. Most spirits came to Dirge in time, but sometimes a spirit was unable or unwilling to leave the mortal world behind.</string>
  <string id="72938" soundid="135123">We would seek out these lost spirits. Those with unfinished business, or those who had suffered traumatic deaths, would need our help to reach Dirge.</string>

  <string id="73355" soundid="158562">I don&apos;t want to think about it too much. Manipulating chi has not come as naturally to me as it has to you. The things I do are... different.</string>
  <string id="73356" soundid="99381">Who would have thought Hapless Han would lose? At least, not like *that.*</string>
  <string id="73357" soundid="158563">I can see spirit shapes and hear the odd whisper. Master Li was surprised, but he has not had time to look into it further. Your training is his primary interest.</string>
  <string id="73358" soundid="158564">Hopefully, I&apos;ll find my skills useful for more than just keeping me up at night. Could we go on to something else?</string>
  <string id="73359" soundid="158565">We are all spiritual creatures. When we die, our spirits are released to find their way to the underworld. The journey eases the transition from life to death.</string>
  <string id="73360" soundid="158566">If their time among the living was troubled or painful, spirits sometimes get lost. They can seem almost alive and are often mistaken for living creatures.</string>
  <string id="73361" soundid="158567">They usually only appear for a short time. They say what they need to say and then are drawn to the underworld.</string>
  <string id="73362" soundid="158568">If a person&apos;s life was very traumatic, his or her spirit can lose its way for a long time. They can go mad trapped in the world of the living.</string>
  <string id="73363" soundid="158569">Maddened spirits change. They lose their connection to the living world and begin to channel darker emotions. They can be very dangerous.</string>
  <string id="73364" soundid="158570">I&apos;ve only seen hints of those. It&apos;s been enough. I&apos;m very worried about what may be coming.</string>
  <string id="73365" soundid="158571">I don&apos;t know. That&apos;s the kind of thing old men sit on mountains to discover. Some say it is a place of judgment. Maybe it&apos;s about reincarnation.</string>
  <string id="73366" soundid="158572">You&apos;d think we could just ask the spirits themselves, but if we can&apos;t really understand our own answers, how can we hope to fathom theirs?</string>
  <string id="73367" soundid="158573">I know that people should not be able to do what that assassin sorcerer did. Summoning ghosts like that... I thought spirits drifted to the underworld.</string>
  <string id="73368" soundid="158574">We should get your weapon as quickly as we can. I am honored that Master Li feels I am worthy of standing beside you.</string>
  <string id="73369" soundid="158575"></string>
  <string id="73370" soundid="158576">Then we should return to Master Li so he can talk to you about this attack.</string>
  <string id="73371" soundid="158577">Then you should address Gao&apos;s challenge. Return to Master Li, and he will signal for it to begin.</string>
  <string id="73372" soundid="158578">Do not distance yourself too much from the rest of us. What does Master Li say? That you should keep the basics close to heart?</string>
  <string id="73373" soundid="158579">I like hearing about the great things you are destined for, even if they are unknown. You are filled with promise. My skills are darker.</string>
  <string id="73374" soundid="158580">I don&apos;t like your &quot;bad feelings.&quot; They always end up being right. Remember the grass fire? Half of the fields gone in a day, and you knew it would happen.</string>
  <string id="73376" soundid="158534">Listen to me, Gao. Your son may not be lost forever. The Lotus Assassins have power, even over the dead.</string>
  <string id="73377" soundid="158535">I know all about the necromancy of the Lotus Assassins! Take your false hope and go, or I&apos;ll.... Wait.</string>
  <string id="73378" soundid="158536">You dare disturb me in my grief? I said, no interruptions! You will pay for... wait. You are not one of my servants. I know you.</string>
  <string id="73379" soundid="158537">You are one of Master Li&apos;s students! You... you are the one who killed my Gao!</string>
  <string id="73380" soundid="158538">Your words mean nothing! You are a murderer, a killer! Gao was everything to me, and now he is gone!</string>
  <string id="73381" soundid="158539">Damn you and that school! My Gao was never good enough for Master Li; you were always his prize pupil. And now my son is...</string>
  <string id="73382" soundid="158540">Enough, Gao! This troublemaker has disrupted our plans from the beginning. It had to be them in the ruins, and someone aided the troublesome Lord Yun in the forest.</string>
  <string id="73387">I didn&apos;t want to kill him. He left me no choice.</string>
  <string id="73388">Gao brought his fate on himself.</string>
  <string id="73390">I enjoyed killing your son... now I&apos;m going to kill you!</string>
  <string id="73391" soundid="99458">Off you go. Soldier and I have things to discuss.</string>
  <string id="73393">Do you know anything about recruiters for the Lotus Assassins?</string>
  <string id="73395">Tell me about yourself.</string>
  <string id="73398">What sort of things do you keep an eye on?</string>
  <string id="73399">What can you tell me about Kai Lan the Serpent?</string>
  <string id="73402">Tell me more about Lucky Cho.</string>
  <string id="73404">Can we talk about you and Soldier again?</string>
  <string id="73405">How do you help Soldier train?</string>
  <string id="73406">Soldier suffers from a lot of tension, does he?</string>
  <string id="73408">Let&apos;s change the subject entirely.</string>
  <string id="73409">Can I ask you some questions about the city?</string>
  <string id="73410">I should get back to what I was doing.</string>
  <string id="73431">How was the Empire formed?</string>
  <string id="73432" soundid="144388">Ha! It doesn&apos;t take a scholar to see that I&apos;m hardly normal! Real warriors are large, strong, and aren&apos;t folded in half before getting to the battle field.</string>
  <string id="73434">See your weakness?</string>
  <string id="73435">Chest</string>
  <string id="73436">Cut - Slaver Key</string>
  <string id="73437">Cut - [TEMP] Description of Slaver Key</string>
  <string id="73466">Dirge Fountain</string>
  <string id="73468">FOUNTAIN WATER</string>
  <string id="73480">Grab a bottle and use Drunken Master to defeat the ghost.</string>
  <string id="73481">Speak with Captain Ing</string>
  <string id="73482">Sheng said one of the locals would give you a reward for closing the dam. Speak with Captain Ing by the Beggar&apos;s Pier before closing the dam.</string>
  <string id="73483">Minister Sheng said the Lotus Assassins opened the dam to search for something in the ruins of old Tien&apos;s Landing. They don&apos;t care about the hardship they are causing the town. Sheng gave you a key to the ruins hoping you can close the dam. He also mentioned Captain Ing, a local man that would give a reward if you talk to him first.</string>
  <string id="73485">This is your problem, not mine. I don&apos;t have time to waste on you.</string>
  <string id="73492">Flooded Ruins</string>
  <string id="73495">With the flooding of the ruins of the old Tien&apos;s Landing, there&apos;s no way you can reach the orphan spirits. Hopefully they have found some peace in the waters.</string>
  <string id="73513">There&apos;s nothing else I need from you, Qui.</string>
  <string id="73521" soundid="108341">This does not concern you, child.</string>
  <string id="73522">Of course. Silly of me to bring it up. What were you saying?</string>
  <string id="73523">I&apos;ll just mark you down as an idiot. Carry on.</string>
  <string id="73524">Seriously, you&apos;re using the wrong words, it makes you sound like a fool.</string>
  <string id="73526">Continue to examine me so closely and that&apos;s not all I will grab, dog!</string>
  <string id="73528">What are you getting at?</string>
  <string id="73529">You size me up like market day livestock!</string>
  <string id="73534">You cannot resist us.</string>
  <string id="73539">Before I agree to anything, I need to know the rules of this tournament.</string>
  <string id="73540" soundid="108343"></string>
  <string id="73543" soundid="108344"></string>
  <string id="73544" soundid="108345">Wait. Before we go any further, I just need to make sure you understand what you are getting into.</string>
  <string id="73581" soundid="105423">Let me know if you need something. I&apos;ll be around.</string>
  <string id="73584" soundid="105448">I wish I could have helped fight the bandits, but Master Li ordered everyone to stay here.</string>
  <string id="73585" soundid="105449">I wish I had seen Master Li destroy the bandits. That style he used sounded impressive.</string>
  <string id="73586" soundid="105450">Master Li does not demonstrate his skills very often. He must have been very concerned for your safety.</string>
  <string id="73587" soundid="105451">Smiling Mountain has been telling us to study your moves in his training sessions since the bandits came.</string>
  <string id="73590" soundid="105454">Why would bandits attack the village? I guess there are fewer travelers to attack because of the ghost rumors.</string>
  <string id="73591" soundid="105455">The village is lucky that Master Li is here to protect it. He would never let anything bad happen to Two Rivers.</string>
  <string id="73596" soundid="105460">You place yourself in a precarious position, my young friend.</string>
  <string id="73597" soundid="105461">I would hate to see your career stagnate.</string>
  <string id="73598" soundid="105462">You see.... What is that noise?</string>
  <string id="73599" soundid="105463">Damn you, Serpent! I&apos;ll kill you where you stand!</string>
  <string id="73600" soundid="105464">No you won&apos;t, Whirlwind.</string>
  <string id="73601" soundid="105465">Just like last time, you will leave. I can see that this polite discussion has concluded, as so many do in your odorous presence.</string>
  <string id="73602" soundid="105466">We may talk again. Perhaps.</string>
  <string id="73603" soundid="105717">Just go away. You&apos;ve hurt me enough already.</string>
  <string id="73604" soundid="105718">Hello again, honorable one. Did you get the chance to speak with Ai Ling? Is she going to leave me alone now?</string>
  <string id="73605" soundid="105719">I understand. I hope this gets settled before my next scheduled beating. I&apos;m not sure how much more I can take.</string>
  <string id="73606" soundid="105720">What? That&apos;s preposterous! She&apos;s lying. Lan&apos;s the only woman I ever proposed to. I don&apos;t know why Ai Ling would say something like that!</string>
  <string id="73607" soundid="105721">If Lan heard these lies... well, I don&apos;t know what she&apos;d do. Please, see if you can get this straightened out with Ai Ling, before these rumors get back to my fiancée. </string>
  <string id="73609" soundid="105723">Hey, Baker Bei, how are you today?</string>
  <string id="73610" soundid="105724">Go away! I told you I want no part of this. Tell Ai Ling to leave me alone!</string>
  <string id="73611" soundid="105475">Public displays of rage and drunkenness, uttered threats of murder, excessive violence, property damage and, I believe, several charges of defecating in public.</string>
  <string id="73612" soundid="105476">If you trust him, you are a fool. The Black Whirlwind is an impressive fighter, but he is better avoided than confronted.</string>
  <string id="73613" soundid="105477">To become champion yourself you will need my support. That means you and I will work together closely.</string>
  <string id="73614" soundid="105478">An amicable arrangement. One that will benefit both of us.</string>
  <string id="73615" soundid="105479">A wise position to take in any negotiation. I can respect that.</string>
  <string id="73616">Nothing I don&apos;t already know. I can accept him as he is.</string>
  <string id="73618">The fool&apos;s almost more trouble than he&apos;s worth.</string>
  <string id="73619">I&apos;m interested. What are you proposing?</string>
  <string id="73621">Tell me your offer before I decide anything.</string>
  <string id="73623">I want nothing to do with you, Serpent.</string>
  <string id="73630" soundid="198540"></string>
  <string id="73631" soundid="105725">If you want to tell Ai Ling something, go tell her yourself. In the meantime, we have our orders. Nothing personal.</string>
  <string id="73632" soundid="105726">It&apos;s a little personal with me. I like sticking your face in the gutter.</string>
  <string id="73633" soundid="107796">You were never in any real danger, but now the crowd knows you&apos;re no average warrior.</string>
  <string id="73634" soundid="107797">I understand your consterns. We wanted to test the demon against an exceptional fighter, you see.</string>
  <string id="73635" soundid="105729">Can you believe that these thugs would just attack me in broad daylight like that?</string>
  <string id="73636" soundid="105730">They... they might have killed me if you hadn&apos;t stepped in. Thank you. I never expected such help from a stranger.</string>
  <string id="73639" soundid="105733">You spoke to Lan? How humiliating! My fiancée must have told you I can&apos;t protect myself. The woman I love doesn&apos;t have any faith in me! Oh, the shame! I&apos;ll never live this down.</string>
  <string id="73641" soundid="105735">Those thugs are acting on Ai Ling&apos;s orders. She&apos;s the head of their gang. They have a small hideout in the boathouse.</string>
  <string id="73642" soundid="105736">I didn&apos;t mean to sound ungrateful. I&apos;m just worried about Lan. She&apos;s very emotional. I&apos;ve done my best to try and keep her from becoming involved in this.</string>
  <string id="73643" soundid="105737">Ai Ling and I were friends when we were children, but we drifted apart as we grew up. She fell in with some rough people... as you&apos;ve already seen.</string>
  <string id="73644" soundid="105738">Ever since I got engaged, Ai Ling has become obsessed with me. Every day she sends her thugs to beat me up. She says she won&apos;t stop until I go talk to her.</string>
  <string id="73646" soundid="105740">Thank you so much! Ai Ling and her thugs are in the boathouse. Please, just ask her to leave me alone. All we want is to live our lives in peace.</string>
  <string id="73648" soundid="105742">No, don&apos;t do that! Ai Ling and I were friends once, even if it was a long time ago. I... I don&apos;t want to see her dead. Not if there&apos;s another way.</string>
  <string id="73652" soundid="105746">You! How could you do this to me? Lan just told me our marriage is off! She said you told her I promised to marry Ai Ling!</string>
  <string id="73653" soundid="107798">I&apos;m convinced that you deserve a shot at Crimson Khana. Your victory has sealed the deal.</string>
  <string id="73654">Why wasn&apos;t I warned?</string>
  <string id="73655">You want to settle this with fists?</string>
  <string id="73656">A promise is a promise, Bei.</string>
  <string id="73657">I&apos;m still looking into it.</string>
  <string id="73658">Ai Ling says you promised to marry her.</string>
  <string id="73669">Involved in what, exactly?</string>
  <string id="73671">Quit whining, or you might still get a beating today.</string>
  <string id="73672">You better tell me what&apos;s going on.</string>
  <string id="73674">So why don&apos;t you go talk to her?</string>
  <string id="73675">Maybe I could talk to Ai Ling for you.</string>
  <string id="73677">I could kill Ai Ling. That would solve your problems.</string>
  <string id="73679">She has to be doing this for a reason.</string>
  <string id="73684">I&apos;m sorry. I didn&apos;t know.</string>
  <string id="73688" soundid="105782">Everyone thinks Bei and that little seamstress make such a nice couple... but Bei already promised to marry me!</string>
  <string id="73689" soundid="105783">That sounds like a threat. I don&apos;t respond well to threats. Besides, Bei&apos;s only getting what he deserves. He brought this on himself.</string>
  <string id="73694" soundid="105788">Bei promised to give me all that. He promised to marry me, and now he&apos;s trying to weasel out of it. But a promise is a promise. I won&apos;t forget that, even if he tries to.</string>
  <string id="73695" soundid="105789">Yeah, okay. If he has the guts to come here and face me, I&apos;ll talk to him. But I&apos;m not going to let him weasel out of his promise!</string>
  <string id="73697" soundid="105791">Yeah, you do that. Go tell Lan what kind of man Bei really is. See how she likes it when she finds out her perfect fiancé proposed to another woman!</string>
  <string id="73700" soundid="105794">So that&apos;s how it&apos;s going to be? You&apos;d rather fight me and my boys than make Baker Bei own up to what he did?</string>
  <string id="73701" soundid="105795">Nobody threatens me in here. Come on boys, time to do our thing!</string>
  <string id="73702" soundid="105796">Back again? Can&apos;t leave a girl alone, can you? Well, what do you want?</string>
  <string id="73704">I&apos;ll leave you two alone.</string>
  <string id="73705">What about my reward?</string>
  <string id="73736" soundid="124520">Wow, you sure are pretty! And you got a real nice club here for you and your friends. My name&apos;s Tian, but everyone calls me Big Tian &apos;cause I&apos;m so big.</string>
  <string id="73828" soundid="128334">I wondered how long it would be before you made your way down here. I&apos;m sure I don&apos;t need to tell you, but the air has changed considerably!</string>
