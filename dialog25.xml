  <string id="102450">The original script for your scene as Lady Fourteen Flowers. In this version of the play, your character explains that the end of the Jade Empire&apos;s expansion occurred because Sagacious Tien listened to the will of the heavens. The theme of the heavens reaching out to the Emperor is explored at least twice, and it contains the historically accepted truth that the northern border of the Jade Empire was traced by a shooting star. There will likely be a book and scroll stand near the stage where you can study your part in more detail.</string>
  <string id="102451">Edited Script</string>
  <string id="102452">A script for your scene as Lady Fourteen Flowers in Incisive Chorus&apos; play.

  <string id="103170">It is foolish to resist!</string>
  <string id="103171">Why must we wait needlessly?</string>
  <string id="103172">Standing around is not the path to power...</string>
  <string id="103173">Scream for me, little girl. *Wild Flower screams*</string>

  <string id="103220" soundid="158149">That&apos;s it! I&apos;m through wasting pleasantries with you! Now get out and leave me alone!</string>
  <string id="103221" soundid="158652">So you don&apos;t really know.</string>
  <string id="103222" soundid="158653">If you actually cared about the safety of this machine, you wouldn&apos;t be about to fly it into a swarm of enemies. What guarantee do you want?</string>
  <string id="103223" soundid="158654">There is a handle attached to something like the reins of an ox yoke. You move it left and right, forward and back. It should swim through the air fairly smoothly.</string>
  <string id="103224" soundid="158655">Will you come to help us, Zu? You seem to have a good heart.</string>
  <string id="103225" soundid="158656">If... you are intent on returning, I will accompany you. I have already done more than I wanted, but I could not avoid this forever.</string>
  <string id="103226" soundid="158657">You are an interesting person, Sagacious Zu. Your eyes hold a great sadness that is oddly familiar to me, but I don&apos;t know why.</string>
  <string id="103227" soundid="158658">Perhaps I am imagining it. We will discuss it another time. I hope we are not too late.</string>
  <string id="103228" soundid="158659"></string>
  <string id="103229" soundid="158660"></string>
  <string id="103230" soundid="158661">Agreed. There are greater things to worry about. I hope we are not too late.</string>
  <string id="103231" soundid="158662">I&apos;ve seen this kind of attack before. The tools used are different, but it&apos;s the same kind of destruction.</string>
  <string id="103232" soundid="158663">I guess so. I heard Gao ordering them to kill anyone who approached. It&apos;s too bad so many people had to suffer for this.</string>
  <string id="103233" soundid="158664">You&apos;re weren&apos;t always so cold. I guess it helped you here. I heard Gao tell his men to attack anyone who approached.</string>
  <string id="103234" soundid="158665">Thank you for coming to my rescue. I&apos;m not sure why Gao thought he would get away with this.</string>
  <string id="103235" soundid="158666">He had to know that someone in the village would come for me... although I suspected it would be you.</string>
  <string id="103236" soundid="158667">I am grateful. Your friendship has always been a comfort to me. Maybe that was what made Gao so jealous? I don&apos;t know.</string>
  <string id="103237" soundid="158668">There you are. I thought you might need some help with Gao, but it appears I was wrong.</string>
  <string id="103238" soundid="158669">And who is this? I must thank your new acquaintance for his help as well.</string>
  <string id="103239" soundid="158670">Sagacious Zu. You don&apos;t owe me anything. I just helped your young friend through the swamp.</string>
  <string id="103240" soundid="158671">Sagacious Zu... Well, I am grateful. I don&apos;t know what Gao meant by saying he was doing me a favor. How could dragging me here be beneficial?</string>
  <string id="103241" soundid="158199">And don&apos;t you let that Merchant Fen Do talk you into the cheap stuff! He might make a few extra silvers, but your friend&apos;s health isn&apos;t worth his profit margins.</string>
  <string id="103243" soundid="158672">He earned his fate, I guess, but I wonder what led him to that. Master Li tried so hard to reach him.</string>
  <string id="103244" soundid="158673">Gao just seemed to get more and more bitter. He didn&apos;t respond well to discipline. It&apos;s too bad.</string>
  <string id="103245" soundid="158674">Yes, I want to get back to Two Rivers as soon as possible.</string>
  <string id="103246" soundid="158675">Don&apos;t be long. I don&apos;t want to stay here a moment longer than I have to.</string>
  <string id="103247" soundid="158676">I will wait by Gao&apos;s flyer. He can&apos;t object now.</string>
  <string id="103248" soundid="158677">Agreed. I want Master Li to know that we are both safe. It&apos;s too bad, though; he wanted to reach Gao. I&apos;m sure of it.</string>
  <string id="103249" soundid="158678">That&apos;s very cold of you, but I suppose he deserved what he got. It&apos;s sad, really. Master Li tried so hard to reach him.</string>
  <string id="103250" soundid="158679">Well, I am grateful I have you as a friend. I&apos;ve always respected your strength. I&apos;m surprised Gao didn&apos;t have an interest in you, instead of me.</string>
  <string id="103251" soundid="158680">Not that I&apos;d wish that on you. He was such a fool.</string>
  <string id="103252" soundid="158681">Oh. Well, your loyalty to... us is very welcome. You wouldn&apos;t want this mess with Gao to disrupt our lessons.</string>
  <string id="103253" soundid="158682">Is that what this was? I&apos;m sorry for inconveniencing you. I&apos;ll make sure someone else is available the next time I get kidnapped.</string>
  <string id="103254" soundid="158683">There you are. I thought you might need assistance, but it seems you are done.</string>
  <string id="103255" soundid="158684">Does this friend of yours share your lack of concern? Perhaps this is a chore for him, as well?</string>
  <string id="103256" soundid="158685">I am Sagacious Zu. I am glad to see you are well.</string>
  <string id="103257" soundid="158686">Sagacious Zu... well, I am grateful to *you,* at least. I have no idea why Gao felt dragging me through the swamp would be beneficial.</string>

  <string id="103259" soundid="158688"></string>

  <string id="103261" soundid="158690">It is what I expected. I am sorry you had to see this.</string>
  <string id="103262" soundid="158691">I saw the smoke from the air, but I didn&apos;t think... didn&apos;t think it would be so bad. Everyone... everyone is gone.</string>

  <string id="103289" soundid="158717">Woo said... he said that there was no warning. Just calm skies and then fire from above. He organized the students, but they were overrun.</string>
  <string id="103290" soundid="158718">Master Li was taken when it began. He went without a fight, giving them what they wanted, but afterwards the students... they were killed anyway.</string>
  <string id="103291" soundid="158719">They leave no one alive.</string>
  <string id="103292" soundid="158720"></string>
  <string id="103293" soundid="158721">The Lotus Assassins; they leave no one alive to tell the tale. People fear the unknown. For Gao the Greater to have them as allies is troubling.</string>
  <string id="103294" soundid="158722">The figure your friend spoke of is Death&apos;s Hand, the leader of the Lotus Assassins. This... student was strong to live as long as he did.</string>
  <string id="103295" soundid="158723">The Lotus Assassins answer to Death&apos;s Hand alone. He would not appear unless this was important. He usually acts behind the scenes.</string>
  <string id="103296" soundid="158724">I don&apos;t know why they were so intent on taking your Master Li, but they never attack without purpose.</string>
  <string id="103297" soundid="158725">That&apos;s... not possible. Sun Li the Glorious Strategist was the Emperor&apos;s brother and the head of the Imperial Army. Your Master Li cannot be him.</string>
  <string id="103298" soundid="158726">Why not?</string>
  <string id="103299" soundid="158727">Because he can&apos;t! Sun Li was declared a traitor to the Empire twenty years ago. The Emperor himself accused him of killing the third brother, Prince Kin.</string>
  <string id="103300" soundid="158728">And besides, the Glorious Strategist would not have made such mistakes.</string>
  <string id="103301" soundid="158729">What mistakes?</string>
  <string id="103302" soundid="158730">Revealing himself, for one. For another, he would have known that giving himself up would not save your students. </string>
  <string id="103303" soundid="158731">The Glorious Strategist would know his enemy, and if anything is true about Lotus Assassins, it&apos;s that they don&apos;t leave survivors. I should know.</string>
  <string id="103304" soundid="158732">I... I was one.</string>
  <string id="103305" soundid="158733">If you will not be dissuaded, we should go to the Imperial City in the Mosquito flyer. Gao the Greater has... powerful contacts. You may find a path to him there.</string>
  <string id="103306" soundid="158734">It doesn&apos;t matter.</string>
  <string id="103307" soundid="158735">No, he is right to question me. I am accustomed to such suspicion.</string>
  <string id="103308" soundid="158736">It doesn&apos;t matter! Whoever you are, whatever you were, you did not do this, and you do not have our master!</string>
  <string id="103309" soundid="158737">We need... we need to decide what to do. When we know where we are going, when we have a plan, then we can talk about who knows what.</string>
  <string id="103310" soundid="158738">I doubt I could change your resolve even if I wanted to. Perhaps I can at least try to point you in a productive direction.</string>
  <string id="103311" soundid="158739">If you wish to pursue this, we should head to the heart of the Empire, the Imperial City.</string>
  <string id="103312" soundid="158740">Gao the Greater was behind this attack, but I suspect there is someone else behind him. You will find your answers in the Imperial City.</string>
  <string id="103313" soundid="158741">You know a lot. We will have to talk about the source of that knowledge.</string>
  <string id="103314" soundid="158742">Make whatever judgment you wish. I assure you, I have already made worse.</string>
  <string id="103315" soundid="158743">Let&apos;s go. I don&apos;t... I don&apos;t want to be here. I want to go where I can actually make a difference.</string>
  <string id="103316" soundid="158744">That is... a very common desire. The hardest to achieve, but very common. Come, let&apos;s see if we can get Gao the Lesser&apos;s contraption in the air again.</string>
  <string id="103317" soundid="158745">It won&apos;t be stable enough to get to the Imperial City, but we might reach the trading village of Tien&apos;s Landing. All trade routes lead to the heart of the Empire.</string>

  <string id="103319" soundid="158747">If we are lucky we can find someone to give us passage. If we&apos;re lucky.</string>

  <string id="103321" soundid="158749"></string>
  <string id="103323" soundid="158751">He may have old enemies, too. I suspect our true adversary is someone even more powerful than Gao the Greater.</string>
  <string id="103324">x</string>
  <string id="103325" soundid="158753">I don&apos;t know anything about that, but I suppose I can try to point you in a productive direction.</string>
  <string id="103326" soundid="158754">But she is right to question me. I am accustomed to such suspicion.</string>
  <string id="103327" soundid="158755">I know enough about the Glorious Strategist to say he wouldn&apos;t make that mistake. And I know... far too much about the Lotus Assassins.</string>
  <string id="103328" soundid="158756">Gao raved about a lot of things, like hearing Master Li tell you that he was the Glorious Strategist. What does it mean?</string>
  <string id="103329" soundid="158757">I don&apos;t know if this is about you. What did Gao say... that he had overheard Master Li tell you he was the Glorious Strategist? What does that mean?</string>
  <string id="103330" soundid="158758">Perhaps Gao the Greater is taking advantage of some larger action. The Lotus Assassins answer to Death&apos;s Hand alone. He would not appear unless this was important.</string>
  <string id="103331" soundid="158759">A lieutenant, perhaps? Death&apos;s Hand leads all others. He would not appear unless this was important. He usually acts behind the scenes.</string>
  <string id="103332" soundid="158760"></string>
  <string id="103333">A devastating attack that drains Health from your enemies and transfers it to you. The Chi cost for Consume Spirit is high.</string>
  <string id="103334">This weapon will do a moderate amount of damage over time. The Chi cost for Cloudburst is small.</string>
  <string id="103335">This will cause all of your enemies to slow down time for a brief period. The Chi cost for Reverse Tides is moderate.</string>
  <string id="103336">This advanced shield will not only protect your ship, but it will cause significant damage to any enemies unfortunate enough to collide with it. The Chi cost for Spirit&apos;s Calling is high.</string>
  <string id="103337" soundid="158765"></string>
  <string id="103338" soundid="158766">That was quite the crash! I wouldn&apos;t have left the marsh had I known we were headed for such a spectacular landing.</string>
  <string id="103339" soundid="158767">It&apos;s a miracle we all survived unharmed. Uh... we did all survive, didn&apos;t we?</string>
  <string id="103340" soundid="158768">I&apos;m okay, too. A little shaken up, is all.</string>
  <string id="103341" soundid="158769">We were lucky. Only a fool braves the air currents without a proper wind map. You can&apos;t navigate the skies without them. Not safely, anyway.</string>
  <string id="103342" soundid="158770">We weren&apos;t traveling far. I thought we could reach Tien&apos;s Landing safely without one. Obviously I was wrong.</string>
  <string id="103343" soundid="158771">So where are we going to find a wind map of this region? We can&apos;t follow Master Li&apos;s captors without one.</string>
  <string id="103344" soundid="158772">Things are even worse than that. Look at our flyer. Even if we had a wind map, this thing wouldn&apos;t take to the air again.</string>
  <string id="103345" soundid="158773">Ha! You make it sound so simple. Flyers and wind maps are rare things, even in the Imperial City. Out here they&apos;re all but unknown.</string>
  <string id="103346" soundid="158774">Not to further darken your mood, but flyers and wind maps are rare even in the Imperial City. Out here, they&apos;re all but unknown.</string>
  <string id="103347" soundid="158775">Gao and his pirates used flyers to attack Two Rivers, and the Lotus Assassins who took Master Li had them, too. Somebody around here must know something about them!</string>
  <string id="103348" soundid="158776">I&apos;m... I&apos;m sorry to get upset, but every second we&apos;re stuck here, Master Li gets farther away from us.</string>
  <string id="103349" soundid="158777">We&apos;re near Tien&apos;s Landing. It&apos;s a small village, but maybe someone there knows where we can find a new flyer. If nothing else, I remember a clearing suitable for a camp.</string>
  <string id="103350" soundid="158778">And if we can&apos;t find a flyer, we can always follow on foot. To the south of the village is a forest. A trade route leads through it to the Imperial City.</string>
  <string id="103351" soundid="158779">The village is across the bridge and beyond a large marker stone. Look for the giant rock with a painting of a fish on it, and you&apos;ll know you&apos;re heading in the right direction.</string>
  <string id="103352" soundid="158780">Very well, although I do not like the thought of remaining here for long. I sense something. This place... is tainted. Something bad happened here.</string>
  <string id="103353" soundid="158781">Yes, we crashed our flyer and almost died!</string>
  <string id="103354" soundid="158782">No, it&apos;s something else. I&apos;m... I&apos;m sure it&apos;s nothing. Hurry, there has to be a safer place for us to camp than this.</string>
  <string id="103355" soundid="158783">Very well. I&apos;ll wait here for now. It&apos;s not so different from the marsh, actually. More of an impending sense of doom, but that could just be your influence.</string>
  <string id="103356" soundid="158784">We should get going. There has to be a better place for us to rest than this. Let&apos;s go.</string>
  <string id="103357" soundid="158785">Hopeless is a grim word. I wouldn&apos;t say things are hopeless. Not completely.</string>
  <string id="103358" soundid="158786">The people of Tien&apos;s Landing owe you a great debt. You saved their town... Master Li would be proud of you, as am I.</string>
  <string id="103359" soundid="158787">Now we have everything we need to follow Master Li&apos;s captors to the Imperial City. I am eager to do so, after all the resistance we have encountered.</string>
  <string id="103361" soundid="158789">If you could spare some time, could we talk about what we have seen?</string>
  <string id="103362" soundid="158790">I have concerns as well. Hui convinced me that your master is the Glorious Strategist. Tell me, Dawn Star, what are your earliest memories with him?</string>
  <string id="103363" soundid="158791">You would be better served by asking his favored student. He was at the school three years before I was.</string>
  <string id="103364" soundid="158792">We&apos;ll focus on you quite a bit by the time we are done, given the Spirit Monk connection, but I asked Dawn Star what *she* remembers.</string>
  <string id="103365" soundid="158793">The only thing I know about my life before coming to the school is that I was not wanted. Probably because of the bad omens I was born under.</string>
  <string id="103366" soundid="158794">Bad omens? What makes you think that? You said you don&apos;t know anything.</string>
  <string id="103367" soundid="158795">I know because of my name. It&apos;s one of the few details Master Li was told. I was named for a red glow opposite the morning sun. Like a distant... a distant fire.</string>
  <string id="103368" soundid="158796">Yes... I guess so. I wasn&apos;t there, of course. No one but you survived. I guess someone saw it, but I don&apos;t know where Dirge is or how far the fire was visible.</string>
  <string id="103369" soundid="158797">No, no one besides you has a claim to surviving the Dirge attack. Don&apos;t worry, you are safe on your pedestal.</string>
  <string id="103370" soundid="158798">It fits the time, but that just confirms my thoughts about being born under a bad omen. What could be worse than this attack on Dirge and the Water Dragon?</string>
  <string id="103371" soundid="158799">If that is the most troubling thing you learn about your birth, consider yourself lucky.</string>
  <string id="103372" soundid="158800">I am merely trying to make sense of the jumble you have made of my world. I meant nothing and certainly didn&apos;t mean to upset Dawn Star.</string>
  <string id="103373" soundid="158801">Forget I said anything. I shouldn&apos;t have interrupted; you were talking to Dawn Star, not me. I&apos;ll let you two get back to your conversation.</string>
  <string id="103374" soundid="158802">Your question would be better directed at his favored student. She was at the school for three years before I arrived.</string>
  <string id="103376" soundid="158804">I am glad to be out of the ruins. There is so much death there... so much unrest. I worry for Master Li after seeing what people are capable of.</string>
  <string id="103377" soundid="158805">The forest was a disturbing place. Such destruction; it was horrible, even if it was mostly unseen.</string>
  <string id="103378" soundid="158806"></string>
  <string id="103379" soundid="158807">This new flyer seems nicer than the one we took from Gao the Lesser, although I&apos;m really only judging by how shiny it is. A poor guess, I&apos;m sure.</string>
  <string id="103380" soundid="158808">No, no, the Marvelous Dragonfly is superior to the Amber Mosquitoes I foisted on Gao. And, actually, the shinier the better. The heavens like their glory reflected.</string>
  <string id="103382" soundid="158810">A shame I can&apos;t leave it on the ground for all to see, but I&apos;m not going through all this just to have it stripped to the frame by local brats. I&apos;ll call it back if we need it.</string>
  <string id="103383" soundid="158811">Well, it&apos;s much like the dilemma of the centipede. If he relaxes and lets things happen, he can walk naturally all day long, his hundred legs not missing a step.</string>
  <string id="103384" soundid="158812">But, if he thinks too hard about the complexity of what he&apos;s doing, those legs might crash into the teahouse and kill everyone. A valuable lesson.</string>
  <string id="103385" soundid="158813">I will return it whenever you wish to make use of it, don&apos;t worry. It is just simpler to have it out of the way when not in use.</string>
  <string id="103386" soundid="196473"></string>
  <string id="103387" soundid="158815">Our new companion is... strange. I sense the power of the demon inside the little girl, but I also sense nobility and honor. I&apos;m glad they travel with us now.</string>
  <string id="103388" soundid="158816">Well, this has already become an educational trip. From what you discussed with Hui, it would seem we are indeed tied to important events.</string>
  <string id="103389" soundid="158817">You should get going to Tien&apos;s Landing. Zu said it was through a bridge and to the south.</string>
  <string id="103390" soundid="158818">Is there anything you need? I&apos;ll do whatever I can to help.</string>
  <string id="103391" soundid="158819">I&apos;m just as anxious as you to rescue Master Li.</string>
  <string id="103392" soundid="158820">I will answer what I can.</string>
  <string id="103393" soundid="158821">I&apos;m not sure I can make my concerns fully understood. Our time in the ruins, the creatures we encountered... so much unrest.</string>
  <string id="103394" soundid="158822">This was different from what I have seen before. There is pain here, but hatred, too. The spirits around Two Rivers seemed aimless... lost. These are focused.</string>
  <string id="103395" soundid="158823">I feel they would linger here, even without the support of whatever has increased the ghosts elsewhere.</string>
  <string id="103396" soundid="158824">I suppose that is true. Left behind by their neighbors, literally to die. Could you recover from such abandonment? I&apos;m not sure that I have.</string>
  <string id="103397" soundid="158825">I mean... if I had suffered something like that, I&apos;m sure it would have stayed with me.</string>
  <string id="103398" soundid="158826">I should not feel bad about it. I was not left to die. I was sent to study at the school. Probably so Master Li could deal with my... sensitivities.</string>
  <string id="103399" soundid="158827">It doesn&apos;t compare, really. These spirits; they truly suffered and have a right to turn on those who left them behind.</string>
  <string id="103400" soundid="158828">Me, I feel like my abandonment was partially my fault, but I was three, and I couldn&apos;t help being different. I would have tried to fit in, if I had been given a chance.</string>
  <string id="103401" soundid="158829">I know I shouldn&apos;t. I can see the result of such pain in the poor creatures in the ruins. I do not want to suffer such anger... such bitterness.</string>
  <string id="103402" soundid="158830">It may not seem like it, but I draw great strength from you and the things you say. I am grateful for that.</string>
  <string id="103403" soundid="158831">That is... an interesting opinion. I thought I was strong for not resorting to that kind of hate, but now I am not so sure.</string>
  <string id="103404" soundid="158832">Are you saying that it was acceptable to leave people there to die? That they just lack the ability to comprehend the necessity of it?</string>
  <string id="103405" soundid="158833">I&apos;m not sure I can support that position. No one deserves to be abandoned. I have... personal experience with that feeling.</string>
  <string id="103406" soundid="158834">Is that all you see? Just white or black, friend or foe? If we cannot understand what motivates our foes, how can we hope to bring the fight to an end?</string>
  <string id="103407" soundid="158835">Problems left in place will just produce more enemies. When does it end?</string>
  <string id="103408" soundid="158836">The anger I sense comes from understandable sources. Left behind to die by their neighbors... could you recover from such abandonment? I&apos;m not sure that I have.</string>
  <string id="103409" soundid="158837">Is this how you maintain yourself amidst the pressures of your life? By dismissing them? I suppose that is one way to view your role in the world.</string>
  <string id="103410" soundid="158838">I thought you took your responsibilities more to heart, but I suppose I sometimes dwell on things too much. I guess there is another side to everything.</string>
  <string id="103411" soundid="158839">As always, I have much to think about after speaking with you. Perhaps we can continue this another time.</string>
  <string id="103412" soundid="158840">Our time in the forest was very troubling to me. To see such distance between the concerns of men and spirits... is something I am still getting used to.</string>
  <string id="103413" soundid="158841">I have been sensitive to these things for as long as I can remember, but it was not always such a disturbing talent. There used to be harmony.</string>
  <string id="103414" soundid="158842">It was very gradual. The world just seems to be filling up with spirits that have no place to go. That this affected even the Forest Shadow is very disturbing.</string>
  <string id="103415" soundid="158843">It makes me wonder how deep the trouble goes, and what mortals like us are supposed to do about it.</string>
  <string id="103416" soundid="158844">What do *you* think? Master Li thought you were tied to this somehow. Can you comfort me?</string>
  <string id="103417" soundid="158845">Your appreciation is just what I was looking for, and I am grateful. I know we will do what we can, even if the world moves in ways we cannot fathom.</string>
  <string id="103418" soundid="158846">I am glad that we can talk like this. It soothes my mind. I hope we can continue another time.</string>
  <string id="103419" soundid="158847">I suppose that someone in your position has little choice in that regard. Everyone needs something from you; one more person just adds to the burden.</string>
  <string id="103420" soundid="158848">Perhaps I have been looking at things the wrong way. It seems I should be more secure in myself before I reach out to others.</string>
  <string id="103421" soundid="158849">Thank you for your time. It was not the answer I expected, but I see the use of it. Perhaps we will continue this later.</string>
  <string id="103422" soundid="158850">What do you mean? It isn&apos;t arrogance; it is the natural order of things. Isn&apos;t it?</string>
  <string id="103423" soundid="158851">I... I sometimes wonder if I was left at the school because my abilities offended the order of things, but, in the end, I found my true place with Master Li.</string>
  <string id="103424" soundid="158852">Now that he has been taken, I fear that we will never find our way back to that simple life. Worse, I worry we were never meant to have it.</string>
  <string id="103425" soundid="158853">I am trying to feel good about what happened at Gao&apos;s fortress, the lair of his pirates.</string>
  <string id="103426" soundid="158854">We went looking for our Master and perhaps another flyer. What we found... I was not prepared for how cruel people could be.</string>
  <string id="103427" soundid="158855">Seeing those people with no control over their fates... it is similar to a pain in my past that I have not thought about for a long time.</string>
  <string id="103428" soundid="158856">I would not dream of saying my experience is similar to those poor people in Gao&apos;s fortress, but that lack of control... I know that well.</string>
  <string id="103429" soundid="158857">One of the only things I know about myself is that on the morning I was born the sky was red, like distant mountains were on fire. Perhaps it was Dirge burning, as Zu said.</string>
  <string id="103430" soundid="158858">I believe it was an ill omen, and that stigma is why my abilities became a burden. That&apos;s why I must have been left at the school.</string>
  <string id="103431" soundid="158859">To be subject to the whims of someone else just because of what you are, be you slave or outsider... yes, I know that well.</string>
  <string id="103432" soundid="158860">Yes, you are an outsider too, albeit one with power to change your world. I think the slaves in the pirate lair would greatly appreciate your skill in defense.</string>
  <string id="103433" soundid="158861">And I would make great use of your confidence. You inspire me to think of the possibilities, not just the problems.</string>
  <string id="103434" soundid="158862">I&apos;m gaining an appreciation for the person you are becoming. Perhaps we should speak on these matters again some time.</string>
  <string id="103435" soundid="158863">I already said I am not drawing a direct comparison. I know full well that there is a difference between being shunned and being imprisoned.</string>
  <string id="103436" soundid="158864">However, they can take cold comfort in being able to see the bars holding them. No one was pretending they are anything but slaves.</string>
  <string id="103437" soundid="158865">When people find out about my abilities, I make them uncomfortable, but no one says it aloud. The walls that keep me out are unseen, but they are there.</string>
  <string id="103438" soundid="158866">Are people to be blamed for the pain that others cause them? What if they had no ability to affect their lot in life?</string>
  <string id="103439" soundid="158867">I was born under an ominous sign. When I started... seeing things, it must have confirmed the superstitions people had formed about me.</string>
  <string id="103440" soundid="158868">Was I &quot;weak?&quot; Was my eventual shunning my own fault? Were these slaves at fault because someone else locked them away?</string>
  <string id="103441" soundid="158869">You suggest that the only reason I feel bad is that I allow it. It is not the worst idea I have ever heard, but your approach is very... indelicate.</string>
  <string id="103442" soundid="158870">Perhaps I was expecting sage counsel such as Master Li might give, but he is not here, and we are both discovering what sort of master you will be.</string>
  <string id="103443" soundid="158871">S-so you claim that I give them more strength than they ever had by dwelling on the past? A simple answer... too simple.</string>
  <string id="103444" soundid="158872">It is worth considering, but there is no epiphany. I already know I shouldn&apos;t let old wounds bother me. Master Li said as much.</string>
  <string id="103445" soundid="158873">Still, you have given me insight into what I must do to survive our current trials. You also reveal how cold you are.</string>
  <string id="103446" soundid="158874">Perhaps we will talk again. You have changed from the child I thought I knew.</string>
  <string id="103447" soundid="158875">You are infuriating! Do you claim that I could not possibly know a similar pain unless I too was made a slave?</string>
  <string id="103448" soundid="158876">You&apos;d better hope not, or you won&apos;t be able to fathom what is wrong with the restless spirits until you are dead yourself!</string>
  <string id="103449" soundid="158877">I am through speaking for now. I&apos;m sorry I brought it up.</string>
  <string id="103450" soundid="158878">If you have no interest in me or my feelings, you have only to say so. I will not bother you further, if that is your wish.</string>
  <string id="103451" soundid="158879">Seeing those people enslaved in the pirate lair has brought unexpected memories. I don&apos;t claim to have suffered as they have, but some things are similar.</string>
  <string id="103452" soundid="158880">Do you have time now? I wanted to speak with you quite a while ago, but you have only now come around.</string>
  <string id="103453" soundid="158881">I feel as though I am bothering you with my feelings. All you have to do is say the word, and I will no longer burden you with my thoughts.</string>
  <string id="103454" soundid="158882">[Success] I know, and I am sorry to stress you further. I will try to be more gentle in my concerns.</string>
  <string id="103455" soundid="158883">I just wanted to talk about what we have seen. You are all that I have left, and as a friend, I value your perception.</string>
  <string id="103456" soundid="158884">[Failure] Your words are hollow. Perhaps you are concerned about other things. I can see my thoughts only distract you.</string>
  <string id="103457" soundid="158885">I will not bother you again unless it is of the utmost importance. I don&apos;t want to impede our rescue of Master Li.</string>
  <string id="103458" soundid="158886">[Success] Thank you. I am sorry to distract you so, but much of what is happening is confusing to me as well.</string>
  <string id="103459" soundid="158887">[Success] I am sorry. I did not mean to add to the stress of an already troubling situation.</string>
  <string id="103460" soundid="158888">I see. Well, I will try to remain quiet about anything but the most basic information. I... sorry I wasted your time... and mine.</string>
  <string id="103461" soundid="158889">Do you actually want to talk? This is not the first time you have put off my request. You seemed sincere before, but now I wonder.</string>
