Removes negative effects (such as slow or paralysis)
Drains Chi

Toad demons might not be the most highly respected demons, but this style proves that they are not to be trifled with. A warrior using this style takes the hulking form of the deadly toad demon, complete with the demon&apos;s clawed flippers and its punishing tongue attack. This form also makes the martial artist immune to all Support styles, just like the toad demon itself.

  <string id="119032" soundid="179362">Apparently. I&apos;m not sure why.</string>
  <string id="119033" soundid="179363">Yes, I had hoped we would.</string>
  <string id="119034" soundid="179364">Of course. Good beats bad. Most times.</string>
  <string id="119035" soundid="179365">It doesn&apos;t seem like the fight was very fair.</string>
  <string id="119036" soundid="179366">You are lucky, even if it doesn&apos;t seem like it now.</string>
  <string id="119037" soundid="179367">I... I apologize for the cruel sport you were put through.</string>
  <string id="119038" soundid="179368">One chance is better than nothing, I guess.</string>
  <string id="119039" soundid="179369">A small chance... but they deserve better.</string>
  <string id="119040" soundid="179370">They&apos;ll be safe, right? Because there are lots of them?</string>
  <string id="119050">Lost Spirit</string>
  <string id="119053">Ghost</string>
  <string id="119056">Ghost</string>
  <string id="119059">Ghost</string>
  <string id="119079" soundid="179409">A cruel turn. I don&apos;t know if it was truly necessary.</string>
  <string id="119080" soundid="179410">Why do you make us do stuff like that?</string>
  <string id="119081" soundid="179411">Let&apos;s hope letting them go does no harm to our cause.</string>
  <string id="119082" soundid="179412">A charitable act. I&apos;m impressed.</string>
  <string id="119083" soundid="179413">Yeah, go on, we&apos;ve had the fun fight already.</string>
  <string id="119084" soundid="179414">I like this, even if we had to fight.</string>
  <string id="119085" soundid="179415">I&apos;d run if I were you.</string>
  <string id="119091" soundid="179421">Master Li might have trained you from birth as if you were his son, but even that can&apos;t make you perfect, can it?</string>
  <string id="119092" soundid="179422">Sure, Master Li&apos;s trained you as if you were his own daughter, but even that can&apos;t guarantee perfection.</string>
  <string id="119094" soundid="179424">I hung a net out. Wait, I have nets? Yes, I do. I have a lot of things. Good thing, too, we can use this stuff.</string>
  <string id="119095" soundid="179425">Well, I&apos;m not sure where we crossed from the living world to the celestial, but we seem to have made it back in one piece. And with startling revelations, too.</string>
  <string id="119097">Well, I&apos;m glad these trips are good for something.</string>
  <string id="119099">Didn&apos;t hurt?!</string>
  <string id="119100" soundid="179430">We&apos;re just fodder to him. Make sure we stay useful, or he&apos;ll find another favorite.</string>
  <string id="119101" soundid="179431">We are tools to be cast aside, but if it gets us closer to our goal, we need to do as he says.</string>
  <string id="119102" soundid="179432">Another manipulator that will not stand on his own. But, we need to get close to the Assassins. Humor him.</string>
  <string id="119103" soundid="179433">He thinks we will die. That means there will be fighting. I like him.</string>
  <string id="119104" soundid="179434">You know, I was just thinking how I needed to feel even more expendable.</string>
  <string id="119105" soundid="179435">He uses big words but he seems small. He lets others fight for him.</string>
  <string id="119106" soundid="179436">Smarmy idiot. He wants our help as long as there&apos;s no risk to himself.</string>
  <string id="119107" soundid="179437">I do not like how he hides behind us. A coward in commander&apos;s robes.</string>
  <string id="119108" soundid="179438">Hrm. *I* speculate that Master Gang is something of an ass.</string>
  <string id="119109" soundid="179439">Proper leaders express their hatred openly. This fool does not deserve his position.</string>
  <string id="119110" soundid="179440">I... am growing to dislike that man.</string>
  <string id="119111" soundid="179441">I think Mister Gang is a jerk.</string>
  <string id="119131">Bridge 2</string>
  <string id="119152" soundid="179484">This is so terrible, but it&apos;s for the best.</string>
  <string id="119153" soundid="179485">We have to stop these beasts. No one should have to endure this.</string>
  <string id="119154" soundid="179486">This is for the best.</string>
  <string id="119155" soundid="179487">I don&apos;t think I could either. This is terrible.</string>
  <string id="119156" soundid="179488">If you can&apos;t, I will. This disease must be stopped.</string>
  <string id="119157" soundid="179489">This is going to end badly. I can tell.</string>
  <string id="119158" soundid="179490">You can&apos;t mean that!</string>
  <string id="119159" soundid="179491">No one should be left to suffer this!</string>
  <string id="119168" soundid="179500">Not exactly the generous deed I was expecting from the one who rescued me from the canibals. But, it is your choice after all.</string>
  <string id="119175" soundid="179507"></string>
  <string id="119176" soundid="179508">After years of humilation and degradation at the hands of my gentle spouse, I can tell you firsthand that your brash approach will never be effective.</string>
  <string id="119177" soundid="179509"></string>
  <string id="119178" soundid="179510">If you ever want me to show you how to win a woman&apos;s heart, please just ask.</string>
  <string id="119179" soundid="179511"></string>
  <string id="119180" soundid="179512">Wow, and I thought I was bad when it came to the ladies. With that kind of talk you&apos;ll never get her married to anyone.</string>
  <string id="119181" soundid="179513"></string>
  <string id="119182" soundid="179514">I never knew you were such a romantic, though I always knew you had a generous heart.</string>
  <string id="119183" soundid="179515">Ahh... perhaps now they will enjoy many, many years of wedded bliss together... as I have. Many... many, long years.</string>
  <string id="119184" soundid="179516">All I can say is, at least we got paid, or that could have been the biggest waste of time I&apos;ve participated in.</string>
  <string id="119185" soundid="179517"></string>
  <string id="119198">Ah! I have no stomach for this!</string>
  <string id="119199">Terror!</string>
  <string id="119200">You can&apos;t resist me!</string>
  <string id="119201">The fight is over!</string>
  <string id="119206">I can keep going! I&apos;m healed!</string>
  <string id="119207">I.. won&apos;t last long... Poison.</string>
  <string id="119208">See?! Take that!</string>
  <string id="119209">You are most skillful to defend.</string>
  <string id="119210">Your skills cannot save you.</string>
  <string id="119211">This is the end!</string>
  <string id="119212">Nothing can stop me.</string>
  <string id="119213">One must fall!</string>
  <string id="119214">Your final mistake is made.</string>
  <string id="119215">No talk! Only death!</string>
  <string id="119220">I heal and can continue.</string>
  <string id="119221">Poison! How... annoying.</string>
  <string id="119222">Death comes swiftly!</string>
  <string id="119223">I am royalty. My time is worth far more than this.</string>
  <string id="119224">Be careful!</string>
  <string id="119225">You are wounded!</string>
  <string id="119226">Well fought and won.</string>
  <string id="119227">A well earned victory.</string>
  <string id="119228">What now. This cannot be.</string>
  <string id="119229">We have lost the future of the Empire.</string>
  <string id="119230">Impressive, as always.</string>
  <string id="119231">I am ready. Let them come.</string>
  <string id="119232">This should be interesting.</string>
  <string id="119233">Another falls!</string>
  <string id="119234">A victory, of course.</string>
  <string id="119252" soundid="179589"></string>
  <string id="119257">I have healed.</string>
  <string id="119258">I... I&apos;ve been poisoned!</string>
  <string id="119259">Take that!</string>
  <string id="119260">My style won&apos;t serve here.</string>
  <string id="119261">Cry for your life.</string>
  <string id="119262">Feel death&apos;s icy breath!</string>
  <string id="119263">By the honor of my family!</string>
  <string id="119264">I must inflict pain.</string>
  <string id="119265">I&apos;ll re-educate you.</string>
  <string id="119266">My art brings you low.</string>
  <string id="119271">Refreshing.</string>
  <string id="119272">My blood curdles!</string>
  <string id="119273">As it was meant to be!</string>
  <string id="119310" soundid="179655">Careful now. You&apos;ll dent something.</string>
  <string id="119311" soundid="179656">Don&apos;t let them hit us. I just finished this thing.</string>
  <string id="119312" soundid="179657">More dodging, less catching!</string>
  <string id="119313" soundid="179658">Hey, watch what you are doing!</string>
  <string id="119314" soundid="179659">Do you know what you are doing? Avoid their assault!</string>
  <string id="119315" soundid="179660">We can&apos;t take much more of this.</string>
  <string id="119316" soundid="179661">Interesting strategy. Now try winning!</string>
  <string id="119317" soundid="179662">That&apos;s it, we have to get out of the fight. You&apos;re scuffing the finish!</string>
  <string id="119318" soundid="179663">Okay, another impact and we start losing pieces. Abandon the fight.</string>
  <string id="119319" soundid="179664">Whoa, that was close. We need to end this.</string>
  <string id="119320" soundid="179665">This looks familiar... keep going. I... I have the urge to build something!</string>
  <string id="119321" soundid="179666">There are memories in the route we are flying. Keep going!</string>
  <string id="119322" soundid="179667">I see patterns, schematics. Keep going, I&apos;ll hammer it out.</string>
  <string id="119323" soundid="179668">Almost there. Just a few more pieces to figure out.</string>
  <string id="119324" soundid="179669">Ha ha! That was an inspiring flight. I&apos;ve made something... interesting.</string>
  <string id="119325" soundid="179670">No, no, no! We have to withdraw, and I&apos;ve made nothing but scrap. We have to try again.</string>
  <string id="119326" soundid="179671">More memories are hidden in this route. Interesting.</string>
  <string id="119327" soundid="179672">Keep going. I&apos;m beginning to think there is a lot at stake here.</string>
  <string id="119328" soundid="179673">Yes, yes, I see things so clearly now.</string>
  <string id="119329" soundid="179674">Interesting. No actual destination, but my memory is prodded again. Good job!</string>
  <string id="119330" soundid="179675">Oh, so close, but we have to get out of here. We need to try again.</string>
  <string id="119331" soundid="179676">Oh, this is... very strange. We&apos;re on the trail of something nasty.</string>
  <string id="119332" soundid="179677">Lord Lao better appreciate this. I&apos;ll want a celestial wrench for my trouble.</string>
  <string id="119333" soundid="179678">What manner of beast are we following? I am a little... worried.</string>
  <string id="119334" soundid="179679">We did it! We did it and... oh, that&apos;s interesting. We have things to talk about. Many things.</string>
  <string id="119335" soundid="179680">We were *this* close! We need to try and make another pass. </string>
  <string id="119336" soundid="179681">Be careful, this crate can&apos;t take much damage.</string>
  <string id="119337" soundid="179682">This thing will shake apart if we get hit much more.</string>
  <string id="119338" soundid="179683">This flyer can&apos;t take the beating. Fly lower and avoid the rest.</string>
  <string id="119349">Summoned Ghost</string>
  <string id="119350" soundid="179695">Wait... I sense something.</string>
  <string id="119351" soundid="179696">You didn&apos;t see? He was.... One of the spirit monks was right there. He stayed behind to tell me that there were hidden treasures still left in Dirge.</string>
  <string id="119352" soundid="179697">I saw nothing. Are you sure you didn&apos;t hit your head when you crawled out of the Dragonfly?</string>
  <string id="119353" soundid="179698">Surely Her Highness isn&apos;t jealous that I can see things she can&apos;t?</string>
  <string id="119354" soundid="179699">Make light of it if you want, but he said that we should search Dirge.</string>
  <string id="119355" soundid="179700">The magic that restored the temple also destroyed spells that cloaked chests hidden in the ruins. The monks used these chests to hide treasures, including powerful weapons.</string>
  <string id="119356" soundid="179701">They didn&apos;t want them to fall into the Emperor&apos;s hands. He said that one was nearby. Maybe we can find it before we reach the bridge. Lead on.</string>
  <string id="119357" soundid="179702">You must listen to me, girl. There isn&apos;t much time. You must search Dirge and look for the chests that were hidden all these years.</string>
  <string id="119358" soundid="179703">When the Emperor attacked, we hid ancient weapons and other treasures in these chests, to keep them safe from Sun Hai&apos;s greedy hands.</string>
  <string id="119359" soundid="179704">With the wards restored, spells that had hidden these chests were wiped away. You must find them if you can; they will be all throughout Dirge.</string>
  <string id="119360" soundid="179705">What are you staring at? Shouldn&apos;t we be going to the bridge?</string>
  <string id="119361" soundid="179706">You didn&apos;t see him, did you? It doesn&apos;t matter. I know what we&apos;re looking for. Follow me.</string>
  <string id="119373">AUTOSAVING...</string>
  <string id="119400">Total Gems: %d</string>
  <string id="119415">To the Throne Room</string>
  <string id="119416">To the Throne Room</string>
  <string id="119422">Hingoo Arrested</string>
  <string id="119428">For the Emperor!</string>
  <string id="119434">Mission Complete!</string>
  <string id="119464" soundid="198041">Perhaps a more direct application of my power will show you what you are up against...</string>
  <string id="119467" soundid="198042">...and just how restrictive your shell truly is.</string>
  <string id="119471" soundid="195298">No!</string>
  <string id="119472" soundid="198043">Yes, this will amuse me. Worse than actually dying. Seeing death come and being unable to stop it.</string>
  <string id="119480" soundid="195299"></string>
  <string id="119490" soundid="197533"></string>
  <string id="119492" soundid="195300">I won&apos;t let you disgrace the Empire!</string>
  <string id="119493" soundid="195301">ENOUGH!</string>
  <string id="119494" soundid="195302">ENOUGH!</string>
  <string id="119495" soundid="195303"></string>
  <string id="119497" soundid="198049">Go! I will do what I must.</string>
  <string id="119500" soundid="198051"></string>
  <string id="119505" soundid="179851">Horrible. If the Emperor really is behind this, he&apos;s a monster.</string>
  <string id="119506" soundid="179852">How does this glorify the Emperor? I know we will discover that Death&apos;s hand is behind it all.</string>
  <string id="119507" soundid="179853">If this really is the Emperor&apos;s bidding, he is a true villain.</string>
  <string id="119508" soundid="179854">I suppose it puts them to use, but it&apos;s not really the way to treat a fallen enemy.</string>
  <string id="119509" soundid="179855">This is what we fight against? Death&apos;s Hand or the Emperor, we face a monster.</string>
  <string id="119510" soundid="179856">I don&apos;t like this machine. It smells like dead things.</string>
  <string id="119512" soundid="179858">Hopefully service under Master Gang will lead us to the information we need. We knew about the golems, but is Death&apos;s Hand or the Emperor behind it all?</string>
  <string id="119513" soundid="179859">Find Master Gang. Once we are close enough to the heart of the Assassins we can prove Death&apos;s Hand is behind this golem army.</string>
  <string id="119514" soundid="179860">Serving Master Gang should lead us to the information we need. Is Death&apos;s Hand or the Emperor behind the golem army?</string>
  <string id="119515" soundid="179861">So we serve Gang until we find the information we need? I&apos;d rather fight the golem army. That would draw out their leaders, whether Death&apos;s Hand or the Emperor.</string>
  <string id="119516" soundid="179862">We know of the golem army, but who is behind it, Death&apos;s Hand or the Emperor? I suppose we have no choice but to seek this Master Gang. </string>
  <string id="119517" soundid="179863">So does this place belong to Death&apos;s Hand or the Emperor? Maybe Mister Gang can say who is building these clay men.</string>
  <string id="119519" soundid="179865"></string>
  <string id="119520" soundid="179866">Shouldn&apos;t we be going to the bridge? It&apos;s not going to defend itself.</string>
  <string id="119521" soundid="179867">You&apos;ve already found that new blade, don&apos;t you want to try it out?</string>
  <string id="119522" soundid="179868">Either try and find one of these mysterious chests you were talking about or head to the bridge. Either way, be quick about it!</string>
  <string id="119523" soundid="179869"></string>
  <string id="119524" soundid="179870">I have to admit, you handled yourself very well out there. For a farm girl, that is.</string>
  <string id="119525" soundid="179871">I&apos;m sure I couldn&apos;t have done half as well without a princess there to keep one or two busy while I did all the work.</string>
  <string id="119526" soundid="179872">That&apos;s clearly the problem with you people from Two Rivers: no respect for royalty. Must be something in the water.</string>
  <string id="119527" soundid="179873">We should get back to the temple. Go on, Dawn Star, I&apos;ll follow your lead...for now.</string>
  <string id="119528" soundid="179874">Shouldn&apos;t we be heading back to the temple?</string>
  <string id="119529" soundid="179875">You have your sword, and I&apos;m sure if there&apos;s more weapons lying about, Wild Flower will sense them.</string>
  <string id="119530" soundid="179876">Unless you were looking for something else?</string>
  <string id="119538" soundid="179884">How could you do that? How can you just kill a man in cold blood? I am worried this journey to find Master Li is changing you.</string>
  <string id="119539" soundid="179885">Quick and to the point. I like it. I just hope we&apos;re done with this whole matter now.</string>
  <string id="119540" soundid="179886">That was a little uncalled for. I&apos;m no stranger to violence, but even I shy away from killing a defenseless man.</string>
  <string id="119542" soundid="179888"></string>
  <string id="119543" soundid="179889">You&apos;re not supposed to be here. [giggle] And we can&apos;t let you go up there either.</string>
  <string id="119544" soundid="179890"></string>
  <string id="119545" soundid="179891">*I* won&apos;t let you go up there!</string>
  <string id="119546" soundid="179892"></string>
  <string id="119547" soundid="179893">Ya Zhen: Well, well. They&apos;ve sent you here to die, you know. A noble sacrifice, but one made in vain.</string>
  <string id="119548" soundid="179894"></string>
  <string id="119549" soundid="179895">I will enjoy your suffering to the last drop!</string>
  <string id="119550" soundid="179896"></string>
  <string id="119551" soundid="179897"></string>
  <string id="119552" soundid="179898">Something...</string>
  <string id="119553" soundid="179899"></string>
  <string id="119554" soundid="179900">Chai Ka: There is a power here... something old, but powerful. A relic of the Spirit Monks.</string>
  <string id="119555" soundid="179901">Chai Ka: Time is short, but it may prove useful. We should return to the others as soon as possible.</string>
  <string id="119556" soundid="179902"></string>
  <string id="119557" soundid="179903"></string>
  <string id="119558" soundid="179904">A power... nearby.</string>
  <string id="119559" soundid="179905">Something from... the Spirit Monks? Perhaps...</string>
  <string id="119560" soundid="179906">Whatever it is, it may be useful. And I have time before our absence is noticed.</string>
  <string id="119561" soundid="179907"></string>
  <string id="119562" soundid="179908">Ya Zhen: I must return before too long, but... it is time enough to find this power.</string>
  <string id="119584" soundid="179930">My goodness... I didn&apos;t see that coming. Please warn me when you&apos;re about to remove a man&apos;s head from his shoulders. I&apos;d like to avoid the spatter of blood next time.</string>
  <string id="119585" soundid="179931">Hmph. He certainly spewed a lot of blood for such a tiny guy. But otherwise, a nice clean death.</string>
  <string id="119586" soundid="180024">I certainly hope you know what you&apos;re doing. Trusting our lives to the river is one thing, but trusting them to this drunken boatswain is another matter entirely.</string>
  <string id="119587" soundid="179933"></string>
  <string id="119589" soundid="179935">That kid&apos;s kinda creepy, even for me.</string>
  <string id="119590" soundid="179936">Why would you do that? You could have helped that girl. Instead, you&apos;ve made her worse.</string>
  <string id="119591" soundid="179937">I don&apos;t approve of this. That girl needed a friend... I could sense her spirit; you could have helped her.</string>
  <string id="119592" soundid="179938">This whole ordeal is making my spine crawl. If we&apos;re done here I suggest we keep moving.</string>
  <string id="119593" soundid="179939">Is this over finally? We have more important matters to deal with than helping these long dead children.</string>
  <string id="119594" soundid="179940">That poor girl. I can sense her pain. I think we should have tried to help more.</string>
  <string id="119595" soundid="179941"></string>
  <string id="119597" soundid="179943"></string>
  <string id="119598" soundid="179944">There isn&apos;t time to talk. We have to look after the bridge before we do anything.</string>
  <string id="119599" soundid="179945">I doubt there would be more than the chest we&apos;ve already found this far away from the temple. Let&apos;s go make sure Kang hasn&apos;t been distracted.</string>
  <string id="119600" soundid="179946">If you want to hunt for one of the chests the monk told me about, be quick.</string>
  <string id="119601" soundid="179947"></string>
  <string id="119602" soundid="179948">You handle yourself pretty well for a spoiled and coddled noble.</string>
  <string id="119603" soundid="179949">High praise from a farm girl.</string>
  <string id="119604" soundid="179950">At Your Highness&apos; service. We should get back to the temple. Lead on, I&apos;ll be right behind you.</string>
  <string id="119605" soundid="179951">We should go back to the temple.</string>
  <string id="119606" soundid="179952">There&apos;s nothing more for us to do down here.</string>
  <string id="119607" soundid="179953">Though you might want to look around for a chest first. It&apos;s up to you.</string>
  <string id="119614" soundid="179960">I don&apos;t know what to make of Zu. He seems so tormented.</string>
  <string id="119615" soundid="179961">Be careful of him. I never believed he was on our side.</string>
  <string id="119616" soundid="179962">A confusing man, that Zu. I wonder if *he* even knows what side he is on.</string>
  <string id="119617" soundid="179963">If he joined the enemy, why doesn&apos;t he just attack? The chatty ones are the most annoying.</string>
  <string id="119618" soundid="179964">I worry about Sagacious Zu. And about what he has in store for us.</string>
  <string id="119619" soundid="179965">So, is he a friend or not? Let&apos;s hurry and get out of here. This place holds bad feelings.</string>
  <string id="119620" soundid="179966">What? I knew you had a troubled past... that you were asked to do horrible things, but this is beyond anything I imagined.</string>
  <string id="119621" soundid="179967">You throw these accusations at your superiors and my father, but we have no reason to believe you.</string>
  <string id="119622" soundid="179968">I would not want to own the guilt for such an act. I pity you.</string>
  <string id="119623" soundid="179969">There is no challenge in that. Kill who you must, but they should be able to fight.</string>
  <string id="119624" soundid="179970">I have had my suspicions all along. Now it appears those concerns were well founded.</string>
  <string id="119625" soundid="179971">This doesn&apos;t sound right. You wouldn&apos;t do something so mean, would you?</string>
  <string id="119628">Push &lt;Focus&gt; to Exit</string>
  <string id="119631" soundid="179977">I never enjoy controlling my senses, they catch a lot of things I&apos;d miss. Whatever. We&apos;d better tell the others we&apos;ve made some progress.</string>
  <string id="119632" soundid="179978">Success, after a fashion. We should go inform the others after we leave the arena.</string>
  <string id="119633" soundid="179979">Well, that&apos;s certainly news. I&apos;ll reserve my judgment about whether it&apos;s good. Let&apos;s go tell the others once we leave the arena.</string>
  <string id="119634" soundid="179980">Good. I knew you could be relied upon. The others will want to know; we should go see them after we leave the arena.</string>
  <string id="119635" soundid="179981">Typical, sowing seeds of distrust in their new &quot;recruits.&quot; Once we&apos;re out of here, let&apos;s go tell the others about our success.</string>
  <string id="119636" soundid="179982">Chai Ka: You work quickly, but they see potential. The others will want to know of your success after we leave the arena.</string>
  <string id="119637" soundid="179983">Ya Zhen: This should be fun for everyone involved. The Assassins are my kind of people, insofar as I hate pretty much everyone. Let&apos;s go tell the others after we leave the arena.</string>
  <string id="119638" soundid="179984"></string>
  <string id="119647" soundid="179993">That explains how they are produced in such numbers, but is it for the Emperor or Death&apos;s Hand?</string>
  <string id="119648" soundid="179994">Death&apos;s Hand has great power. We need proof of this from the inner chambers.</string>
  <string id="119649" soundid="179995">So the army can grow fast, but under who&apos;s authority?</string>
  <string id="119650" soundid="179996">Fake warriors? Whoever runs this has no idea what makes battle fun.</string>
  <string id="119651" soundid="179997">We have to find proof of Death&apos;s Hand ordering this, but I don&apos;t want it in *anybody&apos;s* hands.</string>
  <string id="119652" soundid="179998">That&apos;s a lot of clay men for the Emperor, or is it Death&apos;s Hand? We have to find out which, right?</string>
  <string id="119677" soundid="180025">I hope this floating log can handle the weight of a man like me. If I fall in I&apos;m taking both of you with me!</string>
  <string id="119678" soundid="180026">Well, it would seem we have little choice. I certainly hope we won&apos;t regret asking Ru to help us.</string>
  <string id="119679" soundid="180027">I&apos;m all for taking risk, but only when I&apos;m making the rules. I have a hard time trusting the skills of this drunken boatswain.</string>
  <string id="119680" soundid="180028">I suppose this is the only way for us to continue. I just hope he isn&apos;t wasting our time.</string>
  <string id="119681" soundid="180029">I... guess I&apos;ll have to trust you, but I really don&apos;t like boats... or the water.</string>
  <string id="119682" soundid="180030">He&apos;s got a good point about the drinking. If that&apos;s all it took to be considered a drunk... well, I think you know where this is going.</string>
  <string id="119683" soundid="180031">I doubt that man could open a door, never mind a dam.</string>
  <string id="119684" soundid="180032">That man has the tools to be a great drunken master. Unfortunately you have to actually be sober to learn the style.</string>
