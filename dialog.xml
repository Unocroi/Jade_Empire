Once I was short but then on my birthday I grew really long and now I am the longest string in this String Table. My sole purpose in life is to test the Chapter Screen and I can be removed and/or changed to something else later because I am essentially useless except for being really really long. This one time at Band Camp I killed a hooker but she wasnt really dead and now she haunts my mind like a ghost of some sort. In fact just the other night she was in my room while I was asleep and took pictures of me and put them on the internet and I was afraid and I may never sleep again ever ever.</string>

  <string id="2478">So I should use the rockets to blow up the wall?</string>
  <string id="2480">Sounds like a trap. I better kill just kill you.</string>
  <string id="2487">Yellow Lion Figurine</string>
  <string id="2488" soundid="20806">Well, I make my living by knowing people. I can clearly see that you are of the finest sort. That is to say, the sort with silver ready in hand.</string>
  <string id="2489" soundid="20807">Can I interest you in some seed? What about a pitchfork? I have hay, as well.</string>
  <string id="2511" soundid="126210">Good, I have better things to do than to stand around here.</string>
  <string id="2512">Commoner</string>
  <string id="2513">Abomination</string>
  <string id="2518" soundid="135266">No! I mean, there is safety of a sort here. We have had refuge here so far, and the paths below are far from safe.</string>
  <string id="2519" soundid="135267">It is best that we stay here. Surely you will find a way to destroy the murderous fox.</string>
  <string id="2520">Is there any way we could lead these people to safety?</string>

  <string id="2530">Mister Ren at Rest</string>
  <string id="2598" soundid="2898">You are my best pupil, though you came to me an orphan. I have tried to prepare you for the responsibility your skills will bring. Have you given thought to your future?</string>
  <string id="2599" soundid="2899">Your lessons are complete. Remember these basic skills and keep them at heart, but also remember that classes are not a true measure of ability. Always be ready to learn.</string>
  <string id="2601" soundid="2901">There will be a time for that later. I have kept you hungry for information, but you must trust that my reasons are valid. It is for your benefit that I do this.</string>
  <string id="2606">I want to ask some questions.</string>
  <string id="2723" soundid="152296">Your words mean nothing! You are a murderer, a killer! Gao was everything to me, and now he is gone!</string>
  <string id="2724" soundid="141535">I will only allow such a contest when her wounds are healed. Kia Min has always been handy with herbs, maybe she knows some way you could help her.</string>
  <string id="2749" soundid="141537">Yes, and the students are on edge from the bandit attack. It would do them good to work some of that out.</string>
  <string id="2750">Lion head token</string>
  <string id="2751" soundid="3051">You were defeated by your own foolish ambition and predictable temper. I will speak with you in my chambers about your expulsion. Go now!</string>
  <string id="2752" soundid="3052"></string>
  <string id="2757" soundid="141538">It is a shame about Kia Min. She holds the record for the most opponents defeated in my little training challenge. No one can challenge her record while she is injured.</string>
  <string id="2767" soundid="141539">You could match it, but with Kia Min injured, there aren&apos;t enough students free to beat it. You will have to wait until she is healed to challenge the record.</string>
  <string id="2785">A Mournful Ghost</string>
  <string id="2787" soundid="132488">This is the realm of the Forest Shadow, my mistress. It is her piece of heaven.</string>
  <string id="2893" soundid="3199">Everyone! This challenge is concluded. I&apos;m sure the victor would appreciate your congratulations. They are well earned.</string>
  <string id="3256" soundid="26314">Ah, there you are. Have you finished all your business with your fellow students? I expect our next conversation to change a great many things. You should be ready.</string>
  <string id="3257" soundid="3771">Who let you back here? It&apos;s bad enough I must work with incompetents. I don&apos;t need you walking through my kitchen!</string>
  <string id="3258" soundid="3772">You really shouldn&apos;t be here. Mister Teh does not like others to observe him working.</string>
  <string id="3405" soundid="3922">Unless, eh, pretty lady, you have come to take me from this existence of pain with your considerable charms.</string>
  <string id="3406" soundid="3923">Yeah, me too. Okay, Mister Teh?</string>
  <string id="3407" soundid="3924">Step back, Mister Wong. You just... step back.</string>
  <string id="3408" soundid="3925">Do thugs like you think you can just walk back here for food anytime? If I wanted *human* interaction, I&apos;d have a kiosk in the square! Or maybe a trough.</string>
  <string id="3409" soundid="3926">Why a trough? We don&apos;t feed the animals, Mister Teh. That&apos;s handled by the farmers.</string>
  <string id="3410" soundid="3927">Oh, again you are here. What is it now? Maybe you need directions? I have a few for you, that&apos;s for sure.</string>
  <string id="3411" soundid="3928">Don&apos;t trust him. His directions usually start out friendly but end up with a spatula in someone&apos;s nose. Why would anyone want to know how to do that?</string>
  <string id="3412" soundid="3929">Thank you, Mister Wong. Thank you for over-explaining the intricacies of my wit. Implied threats are ever so much more effective when they are no longer implied!</string>
  <string id="3413" soundid="3930">What is this, the third time you&apos;ve bothered me? Go tell the customers in the teahouse their food will be late because of someone&apos;s nosy tour.</string>
  <string id="3414" soundid="3931">He doesn&apos;t really mean that. I mean, if everyone showed up in town, sure, there would be some delay, but most people eat at home, you know?</string>
  <string id="3415" soundid="3932">Mister Wong... you are an imbecile.</string>
  <string id="3416" soundid="3933">You again? I really don&apos;t have time for you. How about you come back in a week. Maybe a season would be good.</string>
  <string id="3417" soundid="3934">We can talk while we cut the vegetables, Mister Teh. We can make time if they need something.</string>
  <string id="3418" soundid="3935">Mister Wong... I hate you.</string>
  <string id="3419" soundid="3936">Oh, more interruptions. Look, I don&apos;t have any work, I don&apos;t need anything fetched, and I don&apos;t have any lost relatives for you to rescue!</string>
  <string id="3420" soundid="3937">You said your nephew was lost. You don&apos;t want help finding him?</string>
  <string id="3421" soundid="3938">Lost cause, Mister Wong, I said he was a lost cause. The boy was spoiled by my sister and.... Why am I telling you this? Just... go away.</string>
  <string id="3422" soundid="3939">Did I not just speak with you? I have no patience for this. I am not here to amuse you.</string>
  <string id="3423" soundid="3940">And yet you are so often funny. Thank you for your levity, Mister Teh.</string>
  <string id="3424" soundid="3941">Shut up, Mister Wong.</string>
  <string id="3425" soundid="3942">Ah, another fine joke. I love them all.</string>
  <string id="3432">She won&apos;t bother him anymore. She&apos;s dead.</string>
  <string id="3433" soundid="127042">It ain&apos;t easy being a dock worker. We don&apos;t get paid much, but we sure earn it!</string>
  <string id="3434" soundid="127043">We oughta form a guild. Everyone else has them, why not us?</string>
  <string id="3435" soundid="127044">Now that the pirates are gone, things are getting back to normal.</string>
  <string id="3436" soundid="127045">Ain&apos;t been no work down here on the dock since the dam opened.</string>
  <string id="3437" soundid="127046">Sure, the dam is closed. But with them pirates out there, we still got no work.</string>

  <string id="3537" soundid="4054">A polite response from one of you strangers? Go on, don&apos;t waste your respect on me. I&apos;m no high minister, I just cook.</string>
  <string id="3538" soundid="4055">Me? There is nothing to know about me. I cook for ungrateful people who do not understand what good food is.</string>
  <string id="3539" soundid="4056">Your palate is very sophisticated, Mister Teh. Some say your dishes are... er... acquired tastes.</string>
  <string id="3540" soundid="4057">No. No, I am quite certain that the problem is with the customers. If you wish to keep your position, Mister Wong, you will smile and nod.</string>
  <string id="3541" soundid="4058">Mister Wong is here to cut the vegetables and heft the rice bags. His job does not include criticizing the menu. I am the head chef. He is nothing.</string>
  <string id="3542" soundid="4059">But I am learning. I will train hard to become the best chef I can.</string>
  <string id="3543" soundid="4060">There is a small chance he could become slightly more than nothing, but I have seen no sign of it as yet. Some people are heroes; some merely clap as heroes walk by.</string>
  <string id="3544" soundid="4061">Good. I need to concentrate on the menu. You want to eat, you&apos;ll leave me alone.</string>
  <string id="3545" soundid="4062">Then go walk around it. I do not waste my time collecting rumors. Everybody eats. That is all I need to know.</string>
  <string id="3546" soundid="4063">The spirit world? You are talking about stories for children. I believe what I see. If I see it, it is real. Very simple.</string>
  <string id="3547" soundid="4064">If you want some deeper discussion than that, go to a temple. Me, I will stay here and cook for the living.</string>
  <string id="3548" soundid="4065">I hear stories just like everyone else, but they are always told by some scared farmer who wouldn&apos;t know the wind from a howl. I believe what I see. That&apos;s enough.</string>
  <string id="3550">Yazhen</string>
  <string id="3552" soundid="4069">Perhaps not, but I have little patience for the rules of so-called polite society. They only increase the time I must spend away from my work.</string>
  <string id="3553" soundid="4070">You see, Mister Wong? That is how we are regarded, dogs to be brushed aside. Talk like that will not get you a meal at the best of times.</string>
  <string id="3557" soundid="172543">This place is... strange. The Guardian says not to worry, but... I hear things here. I don&apos;t know what they are.</string>
  <string id="3559" soundid="172544">This place... there are spirits. The Guardian can hear them, and I can too, but there is something else... like the sound of the ocean. Voices.</string>
  <string id="3561" soundid="172545">The mists here hold voices... coming from below. They&apos;re too quiet though... Old. In the stones and the mist.</string>
  <string id="3564" soundid="172546">No, it&apos;s... it&apos;s different. It&apos;s like listening to the wind while people are yelling at you. The Guardian says... he says not to ask.</string>
  <string id="3565">I did not mean to disturb you.</string>
  <string id="3566">I want to ask something about you.</string>
  <string id="3569">You are very harsh with your assistant.</string>
  <string id="3572">I&apos;m leaving now.</string>
  <string id="3573">I need information about Tien&apos;s Landing.</string>
  <string id="3574">What do you know about the spirit world?</string>
  <string id="3576">You don&apos;t believe in spirits?</string>
  <string id="3577" soundid="172547">He says it doesn&apos;t matter who they are... who they were. He says &quot;They are not under Heaven.&quot; He doesn&apos;t want to say anything more.</string>
  <string id="3578">That is not an appropriate greeting, cook.</string>
  <string id="3579">You will show me the proper respect, dog!</string>
  <string id="3587" soundid="108259">Go ask them yourselves, if you want to know more. Hapless Han&apos;s faced more than a few of them too, if you want his perspicacions.</string>

  <string id="3592" soundid="4109">Everyone gets used to Mister Teh&apos;s dishes eventually. They are very... complex.</string>
  <string id="3593" soundid="4110">Mister Teh keeps the kitchen well-stocked with... exotic ingredients. I&apos;m sure they are all delicacies somewhere.</string>
  <string id="3594" soundid="108263"></string>
  <string id="3595" soundid="108264">Wait. Before we go any further, I think we need to talk about a few things.</string>

  <string id="3602" soundid="108271">So this is the lair of the enemy? We are really going inside... wait. I should say something. If only....</string>
  <string id="3603" soundid="108272">Wait!</string>
  <string id="3605" soundid="108274">Ah, she *would* find her way here. Is there anywhere free of her influence?</string>
  <string id="3857">Do you want to buy &lt;CUSTOM0&gt;?</string>
  <string id="3858">Pilgrim&apos;s Rest Inn</string>
  <string id="3873" soundid="106247">She&apos;s even got a standing offer to pass the secrets of her blade mastery on to the first fighter to defeat her. So far, no one has managed that feat.</string>

  <string id="3913" soundid="23046">I&apos;m not a rich man. But my reputation, my ship, and my men are worth everything I can give. Close the dam and free us, and I&apos;ll give you all the silver I have.</string>
  <string id="3920" soundid="23053">The Great Dam is open, and the lake that feeds into the river is gone. My ship, the Lucky Night, is stranded here like a lame water buffalo.</string>
  <string id="3922" soundid="23055">They&apos;re good men, but we&apos;re all a bit mad right now. The Great Dam is open, and the lake that feeds into the river is gone. My ship is stranded here like a lame water buffalo.</string>
  <string id="3923" soundid="23105">I offered you an enormous amount of silver to perform a simple task. Instead, you chose to close the Great Dam and ruin my business.</string>
  <string id="3924" soundid="23057">If you&apos;ve come to complain about my men, I don&apos;t want to hear it. When Minister Sheng gets the Great Dam closed, we&apos;ll be happy to leave. Until then, we&apos;re stuck here.</string>
  <string id="3930" soundid="23063">If I leave the ship, my men will have Tien&apos;s Landing in flames. The locals think the dam is haunted, and Minister Sheng can&apos;t find anyone brave enough to risk closing it.</string>

  <string id="3932">I&apos;ll help you.</string>

  <string id="3938" soundid="154747">In other words, accepting your place in the world and using your skills accordingly is the optimal way of following the path of harmony.</string>

  <string id="5094" soundid="5729">If you must pester one of us, then make it my brother Sung Bo.</string>
  <string id="5095" soundid="14420">No, no, we can&apos;t allow that to happen. It would be too much to bear.</string>
  <string id="5097" soundid="14422">My daughter, Wen Si Wei, has fallen ill, and nothing in my previous training could help me with what ails her.</string>
  <string id="5098" soundid="14423">Her liver has been rotted from within, corrupted by some energy I have never encountered before.</string>
  <string id="5099" soundid="14424">I don&apos;t know what it is, but it has prevented her liver from functioning. Now, her body no longer responds. I fear she is dying.</string>
  <string id="5100" soundid="14425">That is what I fear. Her liver has been corrupted, and now her body no longer responds well. Without my efforts, she would be dead already.</string>
  <string id="5101" soundid="14426">No! No! No! It... Oh... you!</string>
  <string id="5103" soundid="14428">Have... have you managed to find some way to help me?</string>
  <string id="5104" soundid="14429">Please, if you can find something to help my daughter, you would have my eternal gratitude.</string>
  <string id="5105" soundid="14430">It can&apos;t be done! It can! Why not?!</string>
  <string id="5107" soundid="14432">It&apos;s a perfectly reasonable assumption. There&apos;s no reason why it shouldn&apos;t.</string>
  <string id="5108" soundid="14433">No! It has to work... It has to!</string>
  <string id="5111" soundid="14436">You!</string>
  <string id="5112" soundid="145504">A man in need of a doctor? Why haven&apos;t you brought him here?</string>
  <string id="5117" soundid="14442">But this poor wretch isn&apos;t much good either, No, not at all... But what else is there? What else is there?</string>

  <string id="5123">%d/%d</string>
  <string id="5126" soundid="14448">Wha... What do you want? You... you can&apos;t have me, corpse! Not yet!</string>
  <string id="5128" soundid="14450">You... you&apos;re not dead!</string>
  <string id="5130" soundid="14452">I&apos;m sorry, I just... I just panicked. I thought you were some spirit, here for revenge.</string>
  <string id="5131" soundid="14453">Well... my incense didn&apos;t drive you away... but mostly, it&apos;s because I can&apos;t see through you.</string>
  <string id="5132" soundid="14454">My research has shown that virtually all spirits, especially those whose bodies can no longer support themselves, return as incorporeal beings.</string>
  <string id="5133" soundid="14455">It means you can see through them.</string>
  <string id="5134" soundid="14456">Ah, well... my work, you see, while very important--*very important*--may upset some of those spirits not fully at peace.</string>
  <string id="5135" soundid="14457">My name is Wen Zhi, but the few who come here call me mad. Mad Wen, they say. But I am not mad!</string>
  <string id="5136" soundid="14458">I am desperate, it is true, but I know what I&apos;m doing. The vengeful spirits of this place will not hold me!</string>
  <string id="5137" soundid="14459">I... I am conducting my research.</string>
  <string id="5138" soundid="14460">I am a doctor by trade, studying the internals of the body and the energies that drive it. But lately, I have come on hard, hard times.</string>
  <string id="5139" soundid="145505">His daughter? Well, then something must be done immediately. If need be, I&apos;m sure I could steal away from this noisy place for a few hours.</string>
  <string id="5143" soundid="145506">A new liver? That&apos;s... that&apos;s impossible! He would have to be mad to try that! Acupuncture can do wondrous things, but it cannot restore an organ that has failed.</string>
  <string id="5149">Some energy?</string>
  <string id="5150">She is dying then?</string>
  <string id="5151">What did you do?</string>

  <string id="5159">Tell me about your work.</string>
  <string id="5160">Tell me about your daughter again.</string>
  <string id="5161">I have to go now.</string>
  <string id="5182">I&apos;m &lt;FullName&gt;, and I&apos;m not dead.</string>
  <string id="5183" soundid="145817">I am tired of seeing our carefully laid plans fall to your thuggish fists. The operations in the ruins and Gao&apos;s factory were my responsibility. Their destruction is my shame.</string>
  <string id="5184">Who are you?</string>
  <string id="5187">Revenge for what?</string>
  <string id="5188">How do you know I&apos;m not a spirit?</string>
  <string id="5191">What would a spirit want revenge for?</string>
  <string id="5192">Who are you?</string>
  <string id="5194">What are you doing here?</string>
  <string id="5198" soundid="5833">No woman can resist the alluring gaze of Lustful Lao! I can say &quot;good morning&quot; in seven dialects, which would you prefer I use tomorrow?</string>
  <string id="5199" soundid="5834">How dare you interrupt me!?</string>
  <string id="5200" soundid="5835">Oh, I knew you&apos;d be back. No woman alive can resist the call of Lustful Lao&apos;s powerful yang!</string>
  <string id="5201" soundid="5836">You return once again to interrupt Lustful Lao, master of the eye of beckoning, lord of the billowing sheets!</string>
  <string id="5202" soundid="5837">I see your true question dancing in your marvelous eyes. &quot;Yes, I *can* lift a two person rickshaw without my hands.&quot; Would you like a demonstration?</string>
  <string id="5203" soundid="5838">Not half as impressive as when I lean forward at forty five degrees and yet stand perfectly stable! Now, what are you really here to ask of Lustful Lao?</string>
  <string id="5204" soundid="5839">The only way to find out would be to spend an eternity of evenings with me, wouldn&apos;t it?</string>
  <string id="5205" soundid="5840">Recruiters for the Lotus Assassins, you say? Of course not! No wise man is too familiar with their order.</string>
  <string id="5207" soundid="5842">Damn! You have anticipated my most delicious comparison! Such fire! Shall we dance some more, frisky one?</string>
  <string id="5208" soundid="5843">Worst subject ever! Instead, let me ask you this: What are the fourteen essential differences between a bowl of steaming, sweetened rice and a night of fiery passion?</string>
  <string id="5209" soundid="5844">Don&apos;t know? Perfect! Lustful Lao humbly invites you back to a private room to share some rice at your convenience.</string>
  <string id="5210" soundid="5845">You&apos;re no fun!</string>
  <string id="5211" soundid="5846">Close, but I am far more accustomed to dining in groups. We should start slowly so your constitution is not sorely tested, I think.</string>
  <string id="5212" soundid="5847">Very well, go, do what you have to. Lustful Lao will remain here to stoke the coals of your desire.</string>
  <string id="5214">Handler</string>
  <string id="5220" soundid="5855">Alas, we were just getting to know each other, and we haven&apos;t even reached the best part. If we&apos;re lucky, it will make an appearance next time we speak.</string>
  <string id="5221" soundid="5856">Oh, please do. I shall enjoy the opportunity to admire your... departure.</string>
  <string id="5222" soundid="5857">Oooohhhh, the little peach likes to play, does she? Very well, I know exactly the information you seek.</string>
  <string id="5223" soundid="5858">You know, they say pigs have incredible... stamina. Consider that for when you return, because Lustful Lao knows his little peach will come back sooner or later.</string>
  <string id="5224" soundid="5859">If you must know, I, Lustful Lao, conqueror of the female kingdom, was emanating my yang. It is but one of my many irresistible charms.</string>
  <string id="5225" soundid="5860">You don&apos;t see my brimming knowledge of the 232 points of pleasure, as documented by Men Shi Tsao the Salacious Scholar?</string>
  <string id="5227" soundid="5862">Or that I perform the stretches outlined in the writings of the now-disbanded Lascivious Order of the Abbotless Monks every morning?</string>
  <string id="5228" soundid="5863">If even these simple things are beyond your ken, sir, then Lustful Lao has no time to spare on you!</string>
  <string id="5229" soundid="5864">If you, like all the others, seek to know my secrets, I will not share them. If you seek common knowledge, then you ask the wrong man.</string>
  <string id="5230" soundid="5865">I would not deprive the fair ladies of this watering hole a moment of my attention! Ask one of the others.</string>
  <string id="5231" soundid="5866">That&apos;s exactly what I intend to do. Now leave me, and don&apos;t stand between that waitress and me. You&apos;ll disturb the harmonies I&apos;ve established.</string>
  <string id="5232" soundid="5867">No need! The answers, in order, are, &quot;seventeen times,&quot; and, &quot;no, in a row, thank you very much for your sarcasm.&quot;</string>
  <string id="5233" soundid="5868">No, I&apos;m fully versed in the 68 positions of the flowering lotus, any of which I&apos;d be happy to show you once you&apos;re done with your silly questions.</string>
  <string id="5234">I was hoping to ask you some questions.</string>
  <string id="5235">That&apos;s... impressive, but no, I really just need answers.</string>
  <string id="5237">I&apos;m afraid of the answers I&apos;d get. I&apos;ll be going.</string>
  <string id="5238">I can&apos;t take this anymore. I&apos;m leaving.</string>
  <string id="5239">Maybe all of them, if you answer some questions first.</string>
  <string id="5241">None! Leave me alone, disgusting son of a sow!</string>
  <string id="5242">What were you doing?</string>
  <string id="5243">It&apos;s impossible to interrupt someone who is doing nothing, fool.</string>
  <string id="5244">What charms are those?</string>
  <string id="5246">This follower is not available.</string>
  <string id="5248">Since I&apos;ve already interrupted, do you have time for a few questions?</string>
  <string id="5250">I have no time for this, get back to whatever you claim to be doing.</string>
  <string id="5251">If you can keep your yang under check for a moment, can I ask a question or two?</string>
  <string id="5252">I think you&apos;ve lost your ability to count, then.</string>
  <string id="5253">I will let you get back to... whatever you&apos;re doing.</string>

  <string id="5259">No, we&apos;re done for now.</string>
  <string id="5260">I really can&apos;t take this anymore.</string>
  <string id="5261">What can you tell me about this place?</string>
  <string id="5262">Well...</string>
  <string id="5263">There&apos;s...</string>
  <string id="5264">I&apos;ll pass, but I have some other questions.</string>
  <string id="5265">You must be used to dining alone. I&apos;d hate to interrupt.</string>

  <string id="5310" soundid="14516">Through the energies of the earth and by the divine will of Heaven, her body can be made to accept the organ as if it were a part of her. She can be given a new life!</string>
  <string id="5311" soundid="14517">But these cursed, wretched corpses do nothing for me! They are too old, too... dead! Their organs are rotted beyond repair. Even the ones recently buried.</string>

  <string id="5314" soundid="14520">I need a liver that has been perfectly preserved. Even a short time after death, the flesh begins to decay. Only a few rare bodies are truly well preserved.</string>
  <string id="5315" soundid="14521">I have tried all the organs I could find, but none work. A nobleman here, Ji Xin, had his body preserved well enough and buried in this graveyard, but his corpse has... moved.</string>
  <string id="5316" soundid="14522">Thank you! Whatever I can give you in reward, I will. Please, hurry!</string>
  <string id="5317" soundid="145507">I know there are some practices deemed able to replace an organ, but organs do not just appear; someone must die to provide that replacement.</string>

  <string id="5319" soundid="14525">Please, stranger! If you just look, you may find a pristine liver for my daughter. I&apos;m sure there is a corpse preserved sufficiently in this very graveyard!</string>
  <string id="5320" soundid="14526">I... I cannot leave my daughter to look, not with her in this condition. She hangs on by the barest thread.</string>

Legends of the fabled Jade Tongue, also known as &quot;the tongue of the gods,&quot; say that anyone lucky enough to possess it can control the minds of others. While the Jade Tongue might not grant total mental dominance, its subtle power lends weight to its owner&apos;s words, making an audience far more likely to agree or obey.</string>

Though Lu Fang&apos;s fists were stronger and quicker than any blade, the Celestial Dragon forged the Dragon Sword to give the warrior a weapon worthy of his skill. Hard as dragon scales and sharp as a dragon&apos;s tooth, it is still one of the most formidable swords in the Empire.</string>

  <string id="6605">The serving girl, Mai Ling, has asked you to rescue her sister, Dr. An La. Mai Ling is certain that her sister is still alive, and imprisoned in the caves below the inn.</string>
  <string id="6606">Rescue Doctor An</string>
  <string id="6607">According to Mai Ling, there are two ways to access the lower level. The room that was being prepared for you has a lever which will open a trap door designed to drop people below, and you could climb down from there. A safer route would be through the kitchen, where steps are hidden behind the oven. Once you are down there, search the caves for Doctor An.</string>
  <string id="6608">Mai Ling has asked you to find and rescue her sister, Dr. An La. You have found her, but according to the doctor&apos;s fellow prisoner, they are both suffering from a disease called The Hunger which causes cravings for human flesh. Before you can rescue them, you&apos;ll have to find a cure.</string>
  <string id="6609">Find Doctor An&apos;s equipment.</string>
  <string id="6610">Zheng has told you that Dr. An had some equipment and notes taken from her by the guards. Before she lapsed into unconsciousness, she told Zheng that she was very close to a cure. The equipment must be somewhere nearby.</string>
  <string id="6611">Mai Ling, the serving girl at the inn has asked you to rescue her sister, but Doctor An is suffering from The Hunger, and is slowly turning into a Cannibal herself. The equipment and notes you found suggest that it may be possible to cure her.</string>
  <string id="6612">Divide the cure into the right proportions.</string>
  <string id="6613">Doctor An&apos;s notes are confident that the liquid in the two flasks you found will cure The Hunger, but that improper dosage could be either ineffective or fatal. You have to find some means to divide the cure she has in half, but with these irregular bottles it won&apos;t be easy.</string>
  <string id="6614">You&apos;ve managed to find the right portions for Doctor An&apos;s cure. So long as her theories were correct, this should provide enough cure for both her and Farmer Zheng. After that, all that&apos;s left is the simple matter of escaping these cannibal-infested caves and meeting up with Mai Ling.</string>
  <string id="6615">Escape with Doctor An.</string>
  <string id="6616">You must find a way out of the caves and clear of the inn. Dr. An and Zheng seem convinced that there&apos;s a second exit farther on that should allow you to get away.</string>
  <string id="6617">After the defeat of The Master, you narrowly escaped the collapse of the caves under the cannibals&apos; inn. A joyful Mai Ling met up with Doctor An and after learning that the serving girl she was a ghost you released her with your amulet. Doctor An has volunteered to join your cause and will be in Two Rivers should you ever need her services.</string>
  <string id="6618">Dr. An Lost</string>
  <string id="6620">You were unable to rescue Dr. An from the caves below the inn. With the network of tunnels collapsed, there&apos;s virtually no chance she survived. After revealing that she had died and was only holding on to her sanity in hope of her sister&apos;s rescue, Mai Ling attacked you in a rage. She was defeated and hopefully has found some peace thanks to the amulet&apos;s powers.</string>

  <string id="7758" soundid="8611">Well, you see, there&apos;s been a mix-up. No, an error. Oh, who am I kidding? Some.. bastard has changed my play.</string>
  <string id="7759" soundid="8612">I am Incisive Chorus the Playwright. I&apos;m sure you&apos;ve heard of me, and if not, you have... er, now, I suppose.</string>
  <string id="7760" soundid="8613">One of my productions has been touring the countryside and catching people&apos;s attention. We were asked to bring it into the city and perform here in the Golden Way.</string>
  <string id="7761" soundid="8614">The play must go on, but not as they want it. The play&apos;s been changed, you see! One very key piece of the play has been rewritten!</string>
  <string id="7762" soundid="8615">No, no, NO! Well, yes, but not like this!</string>
  <string id="7763" soundid="8616">I tell you truthfully that they&apos;ve lost the whole point of the piece!</string>
  <string id="7764" soundid="8617">A like-minded island amidst a sea of dolts. Oh dear, that was a poor metaphor. The point stands regardless!</string>
  <string id="7765" soundid="8618">There&apos;s that too. Anyone could take offense. Now I&apos;m doubly concerned!</string>
  <string id="7766" soundid="8619">I will gladly offer you the going rate for a leading man, just for a walk-on part!</string>
  <string id="7767" soundid="8620">You have a most regal bearing, so I expect you&apos;d have no... well, no *major* problems, at any rate, acting the role of Lady Fourteen Flowers.</string>
  <string id="7768" soundid="8621">If you talk to First-Degree Thespian Phong, up by the pagoda, tell him you&apos;re the replacement actor. He&apos;ll be desperate, so all you&apos;ll have to do is read the proper lines.</string>
  <string id="7769" soundid="8622">Of course, all roles are played by men, er, or at least women with the decency to pose as men playing women. It&apos;s... well... it can get complex sorting it all out.</string>
  <string id="7770" soundid="8623">That will be a bit tricky I&apos;ll admit. Certainly breaking with tradition, but if you tell them you&apos;re already in makeup, they&apos;ll... er, gloss things over. It&apos;ll be fine, I&apos;m sure.</string>
  <string id="7771" soundid="8624">Oh, they will. It&apos;s a role practically suited to one of your... stature. It&apos;ll come to you as easily as pleasant scents on a spring wind.</string>
  <string id="7772" soundid="8625">Here&apos;s a copy of the original script for your scene. Pivotal, I assure you. This copy reads properly, not like that edited pile of dung.</string>
  <string id="7773" soundid="8626">Hurry over to the large pagoda overlooking the Golden Way, and tell Phong that you&apos;re the replacement. They won&apos;t wait forever, so step quickly to it.</string>
  <string id="7774" soundid="8627">Now, good... no, you&apos;re about to perform so I shan&apos;t jinx it. Get to it!</string>
  <string id="7775" soundid="8628">Well, of course! I could... hmm... I suppose I could write you in as a character in one of my plays. Imagine, fame and, well... immortality on the stage!</string>
  <string id="7776" soundid="8629">Oh! Silver, is it? That&apos;s simple. I know we writers are supposed to be... poor is the best word, but I never saw the point. Can&apos;t afford ink as a poor man, you see?</string>
  <string id="7777" soundid="8630">Then I am, well, ruined, I suppose. The first in my family--wait... no. Oh yes, the first to see success, and I am undone. </string>
  <string id="7778" soundid="8631">Fine. The world didn&apos;t need to see the real... er... play anyway. Let them put on their tragedy. I apologize for taking your time, honored one.</string>
  <string id="7779" soundid="8632">I am an iamb, I am! Er... was that it? Oh! Sorry. You startled me. You&apos;re back... have you changed your mind? You&apos;ll help me?</string>
  <string id="7780" soundid="8633">Oh, goodness, I do hope that the... er, play goes as planned. Just... remember to breathe and push from the stomach up, yes?</string>
  <string id="7781" soundid="8634">Now hurry to the pagoda overlooking this district! Just follow the road and look for the crowd. Oh... I&apos;m so nervous!</string>

  <string id="7786" soundid="151513">I died before the gates to the underworld closed, but I couldn&apos;t let go of my daughter. I worried for her, and rightly so, but I think she will find peace now.</string>
  <string id="7787">What can I do to help?</string>
  <string id="7790">What could I possibly do to help you with a play?</string>
  <string id="7791">Sounds positive so far. Where&apos;s the problem?</string>
  <string id="7792">Worried they&apos;re corrupting your &quot;art,&quot; are you?</string>
  <string id="7793">Why worry about a few rewrites? Doesn&apos;t that happen all the time?</string>
  <string id="7795">You&apos;re right; that is terrible!</string>
  <string id="7797">Not to mention that certain factions frown on satire of the Empire.</string>
  <string id="7799">This is the most ridiculous problem I&apos;ve ever heard. Why should I care?</string>
  <string id="7802">You want me to play Lady Fourteen Flowers?</string>
  <string id="7803">I&apos;m no actor. They wouldn&apos;t believe me!</string>
  <string id="7804">Sounds interesting. I&apos;ll do it.</string>
  <string id="7807">Find someone else to be your patsy. I have no intention of helping you.</string>
  <string id="7808">My help depends on my incentive.</string>
  <string id="7809">I was looking for something more material.</string>
  <string id="7810">A writer? There&apos;s no way you could afford my assistance. Stand aside.</string>
  <string id="7811">Why don&apos;t you just tell me what the problem is?</string>
  <string id="7812">I wouldn&apos;t have time to listen to your problem, stammering fool.</string>
  <string id="7815" soundid="8668">Had your, er... moment, did you?</string>
  <string id="7816" soundid="8669">I can&apos;t believe that performance! Disgraceful! Had you followed the original script, it would have been a masterpiece, but you mangled it!</string>
  <string id="7817" soundid="8670">Clearly! An actor would have had no trouble with that script. In fact, anyone with any culture would have already known it. I couldn&apos;t believe what I was, er... hearing.</string>
  <string id="7818" soundid="8671">Had you honored yours, of course. You promised that you would perform my play, not that bastardized version. Frankly, I&apos;m surprised they made that many changes!</string>
  <string id="7819" soundid="8672">I know my own work, and I&apos;d have let that performance, er... slide had you flubbed only *one* of the important lines, but that was terrible.</string>
  <string id="7820" soundid="8673">No one could have enjoyed that! Terrible, just, er... terrible!</string>
  <string id="7821" soundid="8674">Fantastic! The scholars loved it. One&apos;s already asked for a copy of the manuscript. I&apos;m sure there will be more.</string>
  <string id="7822" soundid="8675">Here, I promised you this, and you should... er, have it! Yes, that&apos;s it. Enjoy, and thank you so much!</string>
  <string id="7823" soundid="8676">Oh, so much to do. So many, er... copies to make! Yes! Ha!</string>
  <string id="7824">You didn&apos;t come to watch?</string>
  <string id="7825">What do you mean?</string>
  <string id="7826">It wasn&apos;t my fault. I&apos;m not a professional actor!</string>
  <string id="7828">Listen, ink stain, you will honor your commitments.</string>
  <string id="7833" soundid="8686">Excuse me! You&apos;re in my way, and I&apos;m trying to keep an eye out for our replacement actor.</string>
  <string id="7834" soundid="8687">The play that&apos;s about to go on here, obviously. Why do you think I&apos;m dressed like this? For fun?</string>
  <string id="7835" soundid="8688">You? You&apos;re the replacement?</string>
  <string id="7836" soundid="8689">Well, why aren&apos;t you in costume? If you&apos;re going to be playing Lady Fourteen Flowers, you&apos;ll need your dress!</string>
  <string id="7837" soundid="8690">By the starry river, that is the best makeup job I&apos;ve ever seen! We&apos;ll barely have to touch you up to play Lady Fourteen Flowers!</string>
  <string id="7838" soundid="8691">And let me just say, your costume makes everything look very... ah... authentic. Yes, yes, well, good job!</string>
  <string id="7839" soundid="8692">Did they give you a copy of the script when they sent you over here?</string>
  <string id="7840" soundid="8693">Let me see that.</string>
  <string id="7841" soundid="8694">No, no, no, no, NO! This is all wrong. They sent you with the old script. Bloody actor&apos;s guild is staffing itself with water buffaloes, I tell you! Here, have it back.</string>
  <string id="7842" soundid="8695">Damn your guild&apos;s myopic planning. Luckily for you, I expect the worst from them and pulled a copy from the back. Here, take it.</string>
  <string id="7843" soundid="8696">The script&apos;s recently been revised, so even if you&apos;re familiar with the old version, read it again for the changes before you head on stage.</string>
  <string id="7844" soundid="8697">Well, a southern noble funded the location and travel for us, but wanted to make a few tweaks.</string>
  <string id="7845">Captain Sen of the Imperial Army has tasked you with tracking down an arsonist named Fading Moon.</string>
  <string id="7846" soundid="8699">We couldn&apos;t afford to miss the exposure. Our writer wasn&apos;t that happy, but we accepted the revisions and here we are.</string>
  <string id="7847" soundid="8700">I&apos;m sure your actor&apos;s guild told you that we have standard rates. We&apos;ll happily pay you the going rate for a lead, especially since this is short notice.</string>
  <string id="7848" soundid="8701">Ruin your scene and you get nothing, just like normal. Understand?</string>
  <string id="7849" soundid="8702">Just get at least half the lines correct and the crowd will figure out what&apos;s happening. Any less than that and it becomes one of those obscure plays no one likes.</string>
  <string id="7850" soundid="8703">Now, read that script over. Come talk to me when you&apos;ve got it and we&apos;ll get you into final costume and onto the stage.</string>
  <string id="7851" soundid="8704">It&apos;s nothing grave, just pre-show jitters making me snappish. If you see an actor or someone who looks out of place in here, send them my way, would you?</string>
  <string id="7852" soundid="8705">Have you read the script? Do you feel one with Lady Fourteen Flowers yet?</string>
  <string id="7853" soundid="8706">That&apos;s the spirit! Let&apos;s get you into the back and costumed up, Lady Fourteen Flowers.</string>
  <string id="7854" soundid="8707">Okay, but hurry. The director will probably do something that would dishonor his family for generations if he&apos;s forced to wait much longer.</string>
  <string id="7855" soundid="8708">Why are you guild actors all the same? Isn&apos;t the money motivation enough?</string>
  <string id="7856" soundid="8709">Look, you&apos;re playing a noble lady in the court of the first Emperor, Sagacious Tien. Your scene is opposite another noble, Fortunate Puzzle.</string>
  <string id="7857" soundid="8710">Er... what else? You&apos;re kind of sad, depressed even! There, if you&apos;re as professional as the guild said you&apos;d be, that should be enough to work on.</string>
  <string id="7858" soundid="8711">Oh, of course you&apos;re not an actor. You&apos;re a fine lady from the court of Sagacious Tien. Forgive me for forgetting myself. That said, are you ready to go on stage?</string>
  <string id="7859" soundid="8712">A hundred curses! You really aren&apos;t an actor are you? Oh, the director&apos;s going to kill my incarnations a dozen times for this.</string>
  <string id="7860" soundid="8713">Get out of my sight! I have to find the real replacement!</string>
  <string id="7861" soundid="8714">You there, &quot;Lady Fourteen Flowers!&quot;</string>
  <string id="7862" soundid="8715">That had to be the worst performance since Affective Pathos tried to complete his role in Tale of the Singing Reed after taking a sandbag to the head!</string>
  <string id="7863" soundid="8716">There will be no payment for you! We&apos;ll be lucky if our director doesn&apos;t kill us all before he takes his own life out of shame.</string>
  <string id="7864" soundid="8717">Be gone, hack! Charlatan! Prevaricator! Get out of my sight!</string>
  <string id="7865" soundid="8718">That was pretty solid. It&apos;s too bad you couldn&apos;t hit it perfectly, but it will do.</string>
  <string id="7866" soundid="8719">The crowd loved it! Fantastic performance! You managed to hit every line perfectly!</string>
  <string id="7867" soundid="8720">Our sponsor will be ecstatic that you worked his revisions in so effortlessly. It sounded a bit harsh, but I&apos;m sure it will be fine.</string>
  <string id="7868" soundid="8721">Our sponsor may not be happy with the version you read, but I&apos;ve always preferred the old version of the play anyway.</string>
  <string id="7869" soundid="8722">I guess Incisive Chorus put you up to this, because I know I gave you the new script to study. Good for him.</string>
  <string id="7870" soundid="8723">I believe I owe you an actor&apos;s fee. Enjoy.</string>
  <string id="7871" soundid="8724">&quot;Rather fun?&quot; Now I *know* you&apos;re not one of the guild actors. They&apos;re never positive about anything! Oh well, no harm done I&apos;m sure.</string>
  <string id="7872" soundid="8725">The performance wouldn&apos;t have gone on without you, professional actor or not.</string>
  <string id="7873" soundid="8726">You guild actors are all the same. Never happy. Oh well, your loss.</string>
  <string id="7874" soundid="8727">Now if you&apos;ll excuse me, I have things I must attend to.</string>
  <string id="7876">Phong</string>
  <string id="7877">A replacement actor? For what?</string>
  <string id="7878">I&apos;m the understudy you needed.</string>
  <string id="7883">I have this script here. Is this it?</string>
  <string id="7886">No, I don&apos;t have a copy on me.</string>
  <string id="7888">Who revised the script?</string>
  <string id="7889">Why was the script changed?</string>
  <string id="7891">Fading Moon&apos;s Bounty</string>
  <string id="7894">I think I&apos;ve got it.</string>
  <string id="7895">What do you consider ruining the scene?</string>
  <string id="7897">Sorry to bother you.</string>
  <string id="7898">I&apos;m ready. Let&apos;s get the show on the road.</string>
  <string id="7899">Not yet. I need a bit more time.</string>
  <string id="7900">I&apos;m having trouble with my motivation. Tell me more about my character.</string>
  <string id="7903">You know, I&apos;m not really an actor. We should rethink this.</string>
  <string id="7904">No, really! I&apos;m really not an actor. I won&apos;t do this. Here, take your scripts.</string>
  <string id="7916">It was no problem. Rather fun, really.</string>
  <string id="7919">Next time, I expect my name higher on the play bill.</string>
  <string id="7920">It was barely worth my time.</string>
  <string id="7923" soundid="8776">Watch closely. We shall see if the informant was accurate.</string>
  <string id="7924" soundid="8777">Imagine, condemning the Jade Empire at its heart. The fools.</string>
  <string id="7925" soundid="8778">What in the dragon&apos;s eye was that? I saw no treason there. The informant will suffer for a lifetime!</string>
  <string id="7926" soundid="8779">Our informant was correct. Gather the others; these traitors will be *lucky* if they live to see the Wall.</string>
  <string id="7948">Amulet</string>
  <string id="8080">You cannot travel to that area. </string>
  <string id="8432">Weapon</string>
  <string id="8433">Fighting sticks of stickiness. Really sticky. Some sort of glue I guess.</string>
  <string id="8662" soundid="132375">Ah, my good friend! What a pleasant surprise to see you here in the glory that is the Imperial City!</string>
  <string id="8664" soundid="132376">Minister Sheng has not forgotten how you helped him with his troubles in Tien&apos;s Landing. Without your efforts the Great Dam might still be open!</string>
  <string id="8666" soundid="132377">How this could be accomplished I couldn&apos;t say. But at least Minister Sheng would be spared the wrath and fury of the Lotus Assassins.</string>
  <string id="9244">Blocked</string>
  <string id="9245" soundid="127059">Kill the filthy thin-blood, my pretties!</string>
  <string id="9461">You have been defeated.</string>
  <string id="9462" soundid="127061">Everyone&apos;s real happy in the town, now. Even Mommy and Daddy.</string>
  <string id="9464" soundid="127062">Even with the dam closed, Sheng still cries at night about going back to the Imperial City.</string>
  <string id="9465" soundid="127063">Good job on those pirates. But it would have been better if you&apos;d closed the dam.</string>
  <string id="9471" soundid="136815">Oh, and one other thing. The Serpent has requested that you visitate him alone. I know you usually have a friend with you, but they&apos;ll have to remain behind for this meeting.</string>
  <string id="9472" soundid="127074">You... uh... you did a good job with Ing. I&apos;ll let you know if any more executions come up.</string>
  <string id="9473" soundid="127075">But we hadn&apos;t even scheduled his execution yet. I just finished collecting enough silver to cover the executioner&apos;s fee this morning.</string>
  <string id="9474" soundid="127076">Well, you did execute him, so I guess you earned the executioner&apos;s fee. Here you go.</string>
  <string id="9475" soundid="127077">Fun? Slaughtering a prisoner like that is fun? I understand killing a man for profit, but for pleasure? What kind of twisted... uh, sorry.</string>
  <string id="9476" soundid="127078">No! No... of course not. I was just... surprised. After all, he was condemned to death.</string>
  <string id="9478">He attacked me first!</string>
  <string id="9480">I think I&apos;m entitled to that.</string>
  <string id="9481">Good. Hand it over.</string>
  <string id="9482">Keep the silver. I did this just for fun.</string>
  <string id="9489" soundid="10488">Sorry, stranger. I stick to my regular customers.</string>
  <string id="9491" soundid="10490">What&apos;s the matter, farm girl, never seen a real working woman?</string>
  <string id="9492" soundid="10491">This is my corner. I paid for it.</string>
  <string id="9495">You want to be next?</string>
  <string id="9497" soundid="161113">This is what you threaten, human! You want to take the crystal from us, but we are too strong. Too strong for you!</string>
  <string id="9500" soundid="127090">Hmm, I thought Master Li would have your attention for the rest of the day. It is good to see you.</string>
  <string id="9501" soundid="10500">The other girls say I charge too much, but I&apos;m worth it!</string>
  <string id="9502" soundid="10501">These sailors are good for business... at least until their silver runs out.</string>
  <string id="9509" soundid="21583">If Captain Ing can&apos;t get the ship out soon, there&apos;ll be a mutiny. A right bloody one, too.</string>
  <string id="9513" soundid="21585">Heard someone took care of them pirates. Good. Never liked their kind.</string>
  <string id="9705" soundid="127091">I know you haven&apos;t had much time for simple sparring. It is too bad; your fellow students benefit from your experience. A strong opponent is the best trainer.</string>
  <string id="9788">Lotus Assassin</string>
  <string id="10075">In the Pirate Lair, you met Yifong, who you last saw leaving Tien&apos;s Landing. She and several others are trapped in a slave cage. The cage door is flimsy, and the slaves inside have begged you to free them. Yifong also told you that the pirates have taken her daughter Fuyao. She asked you to find and rescue the girl.</string>
  <string id="10077">Free the slaves</string>
  <string id="11254" soundid="108275">Sorry to disturb such a touching scene, but I have a sizeable investment in this and... there are things that should not go unsaid.</string>
  <string id="11257" soundid="107295">The only ones they watch closely are the fighters in the higher divisions, such as Soldier and the Sungs.</string>
  <string id="11259" soundid="125465">You shame Master Li with your actions here! We should protect the weak, not exploit them!</string>
  <string id="11260" soundid="125466">You showed great compassion to that poor man. I am glad to see you can be merciful as well as strong.</string>
  <string id="11263">Damage Increase</string>
  <string id="11264" soundid="107299">His power ran deep. He would have taken our organization even further down Gao the Greater&apos;s path had word of a new contestant not reached us.</string>
  <string id="11266">I am looking for Fen.</string>
  <string id="11278">Pirate Base</string>
  <string id="11321" soundid="127092">I am charged with giving whatever instruction I can, but my insights deal more with the philosophy of combat than the skills themselves.</string>
  <string id="11322" soundid="127093">Master Li is very strict about what is taught here, because martial skill is a pathway to great power, and that holds certain risks.</string>
  <string id="11338" soundid="73105">Even here... so weak... the waters cannot bleed forever. Nothing is without end. Not even this world. Not when my power rests in the hands of mortals.</string>
  <string id="11345" soundid="73107">Names are fleeting... given so your kind can point and say &quot;that is mine.&quot; All words... names, history, dreams... they die on your lips.</string>

  <string id="12976" soundid="145520">You&apos;ll be happy to know that the girl is doing well. She has recovered, and I have taken her under my care.</string>
  <string id="12977" soundid="145521">She seems eager to learn the arts I know, and we may find some way to apply the arts that her father developed.</string>
  <string id="12978" soundid="145522">If used carefully, her father&apos;s teachings may benefit all the Empire, but I must apply his theories in new ways. For now, she works and learns and heals.</string>
  <string id="12979" soundid="145523">What can be done for you now?</string>
  <string id="12984">What do you have to do?</string>
  <string id="12989">You want me to find you a liver?</string>
  <string id="12991">I&apos;ll find the preserved nobleman for you.</string>
  <string id="12993">There is a man who needs the help of a doctor.</string>
  <string id="12994">His daughter is dying, and he needs help.</string>
  <string id="12995">I can&apos;t help you.</string>
  <string id="12997">I&apos;m sorry, I don&apos;t know what I can do for you.</string>
  <string id="13000">Can I help you?</string>
  <string id="13001">Well... good luck with that, then.</string>
  <string id="13005">He is trying to give his daughter a new liver.</string>
  <string id="13012">The replacement liver would be his own. No one else&apos;s.</string>
  <string id="13017">She could die at any time.</string>
  <string id="13026">He is out of options. He has nothing left.</string>
  <string id="13030">If you don&apos;t care, then she&apos;s as good as dead.</string>
  <string id="13032" soundid="145819">I don&apos;t know your face or if it might be worth anything to my Masters, but you travel with the accursed Zu and his death may at least settle some old scores.</string>
  <string id="13033" soundid="145820">Perhaps if I offer your head and track down that accursed Zu who has been seen in the area, enough old scores will be settled to earn my life.</string>
  <string id="13034">You aren&apos;t there to kill, only to save.</string>
  <string id="13035">I guess you aren&apos;t the one I&apos;m looking for, then.</string>
  <string id="13037">He cannot perform the operation himself.</string>
  <string id="13038">If you won&apos;t help, then you&apos;re not the one I seek.</string>
  <string id="13039" soundid="140468">Death&apos;s Hand placed the machine here. It is said the Emperor himself brought pieces of some great celestial furnace back from the heavens.</string>
  <string id="13041">There is no one else but you.</string>
  <string id="13096" soundid="144730">An interesting ploy: napping to attract our enemies. I prefer a more active approach. Let&apos;s keep moving.</string>
  <string id="13099" soundid="135859">You&apos;re all right! Thank the heavens. I did not need another death on my conscience.</string>
  <string id="13100">Forget it. You aren&apos;t the one I&apos;m looking for.</string>
  <string id="13192">Silk Fox</string>
  <string id="13273" soundid="41560">Ah, there you are. I knew you would come, and I have grown very good at waiting. You are very different from the student I once taught. Death changed you, I imagine.</string>
  <string id="13336" soundid="145611">My name is Aishi the Mournful Blade, and if you are another hunter come to claim my head, I suggest you turn around and walk away.</string>
  <string id="13338" soundid="145613">Citizen! I hear there is progress in the search for Creative Yukong! A scholar ran out of the Scholars&apos; Garden after talking to you. Tell me you have good news!</string>
  <string id="13339">Worried Peasant</string>
  <string id="13340" soundid="145615">These two scoundrels have eluded my best efforts, so I&apos;m turning to bounty hunters. It&apos;s harder to run when your pursuers are not in a uniform.</string>
  <string id="13342" soundid="145617">I see no problem hunting down criminals, so long as we don&apos;t draw too much attention to ourselves.</string>
  <string id="13343" soundid="145618">This could be an entertaining diversion, and a good way to earn some extra silver.</string>
  <string id="13344" soundid="145619">While the silver&apos;s appealing, do we really have time to waste on this?</string>
  <string id="13345" soundid="145620">Ya Zhen: Wait, is he seriously saying that we would get paid for hunting people down? I&apos;d have done it for free!</string>
  <string id="13346" soundid="145621">I&apos;m searching for an arsonist and a notorious confidence man. Find and eliminate either one and there&apos;s a standard bounty in it for you.</string>
  <string id="13347" soundid="145622">Do you people have some sort of code that requires each one of you to bargain about this sort of thing?</string>
  <string id="13348" soundid="145623">[Success] I do enjoy going through this dance with each new contract. You&apos;ve made your point.</string>
  <string id="13349" soundid="145624">[Success] Excellent! I haven&apos;t heard that one before. On sheer creativity, you&apos;ve made your point.</string>
  <string id="13350" soundid="145625">[Success] Crafty! Well, since you&apos;ve seen to the heart of the matter, I&apos;ll accept your point.</string>
  <string id="13351" soundid="145626">I&apos;ll add an extra percentage to both bounties and find some way to justify the extra cost to the Ministry of Harmony.</string>
  <string id="13352" soundid="145627">[Failure] I&apos;m not open to negotiation on this, and I&apos;ve heard virtually every argument as to why I should raise the bounties.</string>
  <string id="13353" soundid="145628">I swear you mercenaries want to bankrupt the Empire.</string>
  <string id="13354" soundid="145629">A wise decision. The two criminals are Fading Moon and Creative Yukong. Fading Moon is an arsonist who was last spotted heading for the Necropolis.</string>
  <string id="13356" soundid="145631">Creative Yukong has virtually disappeared, though we may be able to learn something from Lady Rento, the wife of the man Yukong bilked. She&apos;s in the Imperial Arena.</string>
  <string id="13357" soundid="145632">Want time to mull them over? I have more details to tell you when you&apos;re ready. Just ask.</string>
  <string id="13358" soundid="145633">With your obvious skills, it&apos;s a shame that you aren&apos;t willing to help the Empire. Very well, what can Captain Sen do for you, citizen?</string>
  <string id="13359" soundid="145634">Always a pleasure.</string>
  <string id="13360" soundid="145635">Yes, I heard that Fading Moon&apos;s arsons had ended. Excellent work. Burning the poor is troubling after a fashion, but the scholars and merchants? That was her mistake.</string>
  <string id="13361" soundid="190097">Forgive me, but Master Li does not want anyone entering or leaving the school.</string>
  <string id="13362" soundid="145637">Yes, yes, of course they do, and they shall have exactly as much protection as they can afford to contribute to the taxes.</string>
  <string id="13363" soundid="145638">Ha! Isn&apos;t that the truth! I couldn&apos;t have put it better myself, but some people get sensitive about the poor.</string>
  <string id="13364" soundid="145639">Yes, Creative Yukong was caught in the Scholars&apos; Garden. Brilliant work. Only fools steal from those with the money and power to motivate men like me.</string>
  <string id="13365" soundid="190098">He&apos;s concerned about Dawn Star and doesn&apos;t want anyone to get in the way of you finding her. Especially after what happened to poor student Si Pat.</string>
  <string id="13366" soundid="145641">They never do. That&apos;s how these con men befuddle even great lords. I&apos;m sure this Yukong had his punishment coming to him.</string>
  <string id="13367" soundid="145642">Here&apos;s your bounty, as we negotiated earlier.</string>
  <string id="13368" soundid="145643">Here&apos;s the standard bounty. Accept it with the thanks of the Empire.</string>
  <string id="13369" soundid="145644">Of course, you&apos;ve been busy, haven&apos;t you?</string>
  <string id="13370" soundid="145645">Is there anything else that the Imperial Army can do for one of our fine citizens?</string>
  <string id="13371" soundid="145646">I don&apos;t have any news regarding the criminals who are still running free. Trust me, if you&apos;d brought one in, I&apos;d know about it.</string>
  <string id="13372" soundid="145647">Of course. I can give you some extra information on the bounties.</string>
  <string id="13373" soundid="145648">Fading Moon is an arsonist. Her first fires were in the poor quarters, but her last one spread to the Market District gate. Last we heard, she had escaped to the Necropolis.</string>
  <string id="13374" soundid="190099">I wish you the very best of luck, Senior Student. Find Dawn Star and be safe.</string>
  <string id="13377" soundid="145651">Yukong fleeced some silver from Lord Rento, a powerful man in the Ministry of Harmony. Yukong is a master of disguise, and he has hidden himself somewhere in the city.</string>
  <string id="13379" soundid="145653">Lord Rento is away on court business, but his wife informed me that she&apos;d be in the Heart of the Empire in the Imperial Arena if we needed her. You could start there.</string>
  <string id="13380" soundid="145654">What else can I help you with?</string>
  <string id="13381" soundid="145655">That&apos;s not a name to utter lightly. She&apos;s a murderer wanted in every province for her crimes. There&apos;s a fine bounty on her head, but you&apos;ll never catch her.</string>
  <string id="13383" soundid="145657">She isn&apos;t. Every bounty hunter and glory seeker in the Empire would be on her. Since there have been no altercations, I know she&apos;s not here. I&apos;ll let you know if that changes.</string>
  <string id="13387" soundid="145660">It would be shorter to list the crimes she hasn&apos;t committed. She is a legend.</string>
  <string id="13389" soundid="145662">I suppose, but you&apos;d have to look long and hard to find Aishi the Mournful Blade. Should you succeed... well, my condolences to your family.</string>
  <string id="13392" soundid="145664">Put her out of your mind. If such a criminal were in the city, I&apos;d know about it and act immediately.</string>
  <string id="13393" soundid="145665">This is the Market District. If you cross this bridge, you&apos;ll reach the Golden Way, the Scholars&apos; Garden, and the Necropolis.</string>
  <string id="13395" soundid="145667">The Black Leopard School is up the hill on the far side of the waterway, and the Imperial Arena is here in the Market District.</string>
  <string id="13396" soundid="145668">Of course not. I&apos;m on duty here. Find Bai the Outcrier near the arena. He&apos;s paid well to answer those kinds of questions.</string>
  <string id="13397" soundid="145669">I know little more than what the honorable Lotus Assassin presented. Some treasonous southerner has been undermining the Ministry of Harmony and causing countless deaths.</string>
  <string id="13399" soundid="145671">The Lotus Assassins are never worried. Their control... their protection, I should say... of the Empire is absolute. What could threaten them?</string>
  <string id="13400" soundid="145672">I would like to advance, but I am not &quot;angling.&quot; I simply accept that the Lotus Assassins are the true power in the Empire, and I support them.</string>
  <string id="13461">Peasant</string>
  <string id="13476">Sagacious Zu</string>
  <string id="13494" soundid="69763">The arable lands to the south, all the way to the useless jungles, which were left as nothing for the Monkey King, are fused into the mighty Jade Empire</string>
  <string id="13495" soundid="69764">To the east, Sagacious Tien has spread his light to the very waters themselves. And, lo, to the west he found enlightenment among the Hills of the Six Holy Scrolls!</string>
  <string id="13496" soundid="151514">Every ghost slips into madness over time, but some of us have a reason not to. We can fight back the longing and despair for a time.</string>
  <string id="13497" soundid="151515">I will wait. What choice do I have? I know the underworld is cut off, but I must try to fight through the despair and anger.</string>
  <string id="13517">Messenger</string>
  <string id="13636" soundid="49619">We were thrust together by those who oversee this place. Trust us, only Brother Bu could appreciate acting as the wall between the lower fighters and the Ravager.</string>
  <string id="13637" soundid="49620">Brother Bu is aptly suited to the task of blocking things. But that is not the explanation you were looking for.</string>
  <string id="13639">Yazhen</string>
  <string id="13647">Strange Spirit</string>
  <string id="13650">Chai Ka</string>
  <string id="13653">You have defeated the Lotus Assassins bent on recovering the Marvellous Dragonfly, and have recovered their flyer and a windmap to the Imperial City.
</string>
  <string id="13654">The Watcher</string>
  <string id="14228" soundid="98557">Move along, move along. Nothing to see here.</string>
  <string id="14229" soundid="98558">Don&apos;t pester me, or I&apos;ll find something to arrest you for.</string>
  <string id="14230" soundid="98559">You looking for someone? Try Qui the Promoter. He knows everyone.</string>
  <string id="14231">Talk to Mother Kwan</string>
  <string id="14235" soundid="124875">You don&apos;t care about us! Big people don&apos;t help us. They only want to hurt!</string>
  <string id="14238">Imperial City</string>
  <string id="14239" soundid="149726">Ah, look who has come to see us. A mortal then? Shall we feast, brother?</string>
  <string id="14240" soundid="149727">Mmm, yes. I&apos;ve always wanted to taste a woman like this. Such fine quality. Her screams will mean so much to me.</string>
  <string id="14241" soundid="149728">Yes, I want to hear his screams as I tear the skin from his bones.</string>
  <string id="14243" soundid="150099">You should respect your elders in all things.</string>
  <string id="14244" soundid="150100">Ya Zhen: Ah, now that&apos;s more like it. You can be a good person when you feel like it.</string>
  <string id="14245" soundid="149732">I&apos;ve seen you fight. You put that spirit down good and proper. Better than the monks who used to come here, even. I reckon you&apos;ve had training in this sort of thing.</string>
  <string id="14247" soundid="149733">Eh-heh, but you don&apos;t look like a monk, so you probably don&apos;t have their scruples about money, either. I... uh... come by a lot of valuables in my line of work. I can pay well.</string>
  <string id="14248" soundid="149734">Her baby? Not much. It&apos;s in one of the plots there, I&apos;m sure. You can find it if you look. Hm... it was a long time ago. I don&apos;t even remember what its name was.</string>
  <string id="14249" soundid="149735">Hm... but it was short, I know that. Definitely less than 3 words. But... sorry, that&apos;s really all I remember.</string>
  <string id="14251" soundid="149736">His wife? She&apos;s still around in town I think. She lives down in the Market District near the entrance to the Black Leopard School. Why would you want to see her, though? She&apos;s already buried him.</string>
  <string id="14252" soundid="149737">Eh-heheh, digging through the ashes, is that it? Good luck... she&apos;s still hung up on him.</string>
  <string id="14253" soundid="149738">Trouble? Well, eh-heh, they&apos;ve always been trouble. Every few years one would act up and we&apos;d have to have some monks come by and put them down.</string>
  <string id="14254" soundid="149739">But now... now they&apos;re coming up all over the place. The last few years they&apos;ve been becoming more and more common... and more of a problem as well.</string>
  <string id="14255" soundid="149740">Eh-heh, especially for me. They don&apos;t take to kindly when I try to... uh... tidy up their coffins and things. But it also means I can&apos;t use those areas of the Necropolis. It&apos;s too dangerous now!</string>
  <string id="14256" soundid="149741">Well, forever. There&apos;s always someone who doesn&apos;t rest too easy in their grave. Eh-heh, not here anyway. Every couple years some ghost would rise up and the monks would come and put him down.</string>
  <string id="14258">You mentioned something about ghosts before.</string>
  <string id="14259">Why are all these spirits causing trouble?</string>
  <string id="14264">How long has this been going on?</string>
  <string id="14266">What makes you think I can do this?</string>
  <string id="14267">Press &lt;FastAttack&gt; to attack. Try to hit Jing Woo several times!</string>
  <string id="14270">Tell me about Miss Chan.</string>
  <string id="14271">Tell me what you know about her baby.</string>
  <string id="14276">Tell me about Merchant Bai.</string>
  <string id="14277">Tell me about Mister Ren.</string>
  <string id="14278">Tell me about his wife.</string>
  <string id="14285">I dealt with Miss Chan.</string>
  <string id="14287">I dealt with Merchant Bai.</string>
  <string id="14288">I dealt with Mister Ren.</string>
  <string id="14291">Spiritrealm</string>
  <string id="14292">Well done.</string>
  <string id="14293">Player did well, with neither preference.</string>
  <string id="14294" soundid="149766">This is going to be exciting!</string>
  <string id="14295" soundid="149767">I like meeting new people. The Guardian and I think this is going to be a great adventure.</string>
  <string id="14296">There&apos;s a clearing outside Tien&apos;s Landing. Wait for me there with the others.</string>
  <string id="14297" soundid="149769">Yes? Is there something I can do for you?</string>
  <string id="14300" soundid="149770">Yes. Yes I am. How do you know my name? Have we met?</string>
  <string id="14301" soundid="149771">Th.. thank you, for what you have done. I know I&apos;ll never truly forgive myself for what he has gone through... what I put him through.</string>
  <string id="14303" soundid="149772">Here is the reward I promised you. Please, take it.</string>
  <string id="14304" soundid="149773">I... I need to go now. To think... and to mourn his passing, since no others will. Thank you.</string>
  <string id="14305" soundid="149774">Please, just bring him peace.</string>
  <string id="14306" soundid="198523"></string>
  <string id="14307" soundid="149776">My... my husband! My husband is dead! He... he has visited you and asked you to kill me?</string>
  <string id="14308" soundid="149777">And he still wants me dead. It... it breaks my heart to hear it. Even though he may never believe me, I know that he died only by accident, and I mourn him still.</string>
  <string id="14309" soundid="149778">Not a day goes by that I do not feel the pain of his passing.</string>
  <string id="14310" soundid="149779">No!</string>
  <string id="14312" soundid="149781">It should never have happened. I was preparing dinner for him, as I normally did, but I burned it, so I went and bought some food already prepared.</string>
  <string id="14313" soundid="149782">It... it was the salmon. I knew it smelled odd when I bought it, but the price was right, and I needed it in a hurry, and... and... I&apos;m so ashamed!</string>
  <string id="14314" soundid="149783">Yes... yes it is, no matter what you say. I will live the rest of my life with this guilt. But what pains me more is that his spirit cannot rest. </string>
  <string id="14315" soundid="149784">I have tried to visit his grave, but his madness knows no bounds. He seeks to drive me away at all costs, I... I think he might even try to kill me.</string>
  <string id="14316">Your performance was well received by scholar and peasant alike. Your version of the play didn&apos;t touch a particular nerve with either one of them.</string>
  <string id="14317" soundid="149785">His hatred is unreasoning but... understandable. He has never been able to listen long enough to have me explain what happened. It must be dreadful for him.</string>
  <string id="14318" soundid="149786">I... I don&apos;t know. If there was some way for you to give him peace... then yes, I think that could help. I can&apos;t bear to see him remain this way.</string>
  <string id="14319" soundid="149787">If... if that is what you think is best. Please, just bring him peace.</string>
  <string id="14320">Player did well, hit both serious lines</string>
  <string id="14321" soundid="149788">Comp... compensated for it? You&apos;re that mercenary? What about our hearts? What about love?</string>
  <string id="14322" soundid="149789">[Success] I... I see. I will give you what I can. It&apos;s not much, but if it will help you bring all this to an end, then you can have it.</string>
  <string id="14323" soundid="149790">[Failure] No. Please, just bring him rest!</string>
  <string id="14324" soundid="149791">He... he never listens to me. He doesn&apos;t give me a chance, but... maybe if you were there with me. Could you be there with me? If you believe me, he might listen.</string>
  <string id="14325" soundid="149792">Yes... if we went together, he might listen. Can... can we go now, then? To see him?</string>
  <string id="14327" soundid="149794">Then... I eagerly await your return. I just want his pain to go away.</string>
  <string id="14329" soundid="150697">Be on the lookout for the Scourge of the South. It is your duty as citizens of the Empire to report anyone who matches this description.</string>
  <string id="14330" soundid="149796">It was not intentional! I will live the rest of my life with that guilt... and also the guilt of knowing that his spirit does not rest quietly because of it.</string>
  <string id="14331" soundid="149797">My husband&apos;s spirit? He still curses me in death?</string>
  <string id="14332" soundid="150698">Keep an eye out for a young woman wearing blue and gold robes.</string>
  <string id="14334" soundid="149799">Have... have you given him rest yet?</string>
  <string id="14335">Forgive the interuption, but are you Ren Feng?</string>
  <string id="14336">Your husband wants me to kill you.</string>
  <string id="14337">I talked to him at his grave.</string>
  <string id="14338">Use your Fight Style keys to switch to your weapon</string>
  <string id="14339">The director may not be happy, but the scholars loved your soulful and deep presentation of Lady Fourteen Flowers. Chances are Incisive Chorus will feel the same.</string>
  <string id="14340" soundid="49621">Word spread that the Ravager boasted that he could beat all of us together, and so we accepted.</string>
  <string id="14341" soundid="49622">I prefer not to give that impression, but we have been placed in this situation by the Ravager, whose deadly nature requires our presence. </string>
  <string id="14346" soundid="72236">You worked things out with the Fongs yet?</string>
  <string id="14349">Player did well, hit both Satirical segments</string>
  <string id="14350" soundid="49623">In time, perhaps, that will change. We will see.</string>
  <string id="14351" soundid="49624">Fighting as a group is not so bad. We provide a unique challenge for higher-level fighters, and fighting this way has its incentives.</string>
  <string id="14353" soundid="72237">Tragic, tragic, you know. But... that&apos;s life, right? Heh, that&apos;s death, too.</string>
  <string id="14362" soundid="16233">Well, stranger, eh-heh, you have some spirit to you. You fight like a demon! Those poor lost souls didn&apos;t stand a chance against you.</string>
  <string id="14363" soundid="16234">I could use the skills of a man like you. An honest working man like me can&apos;t compare with someone like you, but you can definitely help me with a problem I&apos;ve been having.</string>
  <string id="14365" soundid="16236">I&apos;ve got to dig the holes, fill them, and balance the books and everything. Nice proper burials, eh-heh. But now, with all these ghosts rising again, I&apos;ve got problems.</string>
  <string id="14366" soundid="16237">No one seems to want to stay dead, and I can&apos;t go refunding all the burial money to all the families of the ghosts now... I can&apos;t afford it!</string>
  <string id="14367" soundid="16238">So, I just want you to do a little job for me. Nothing hard, just put the ghosts back where they belong. Quiet them down a bit.</string>
  <string id="14368" soundid="16239">There&apos;ll be a little bit in it for you as well, don&apos;t worry. Can&apos;t have you going away empty-handed, now, can we? Eh-heheh.</string>
  <string id="14369" soundid="16240">So, what do you say?</string>
  <string id="14370" soundid="16241">Just a moment of your time, please, then you can go on your way.</string>
  <string id="14371" soundid="16242">I could use the skills of a woman like you. Normally I don&apos;t think much of a woman in my line of work, but I think you can help me with a problem I&apos;ve been having.</string>
  <string id="14372" soundid="16243">Eh? You come back to accept the job? I can pay you good money, you know!</string>
  <string id="14373" soundid="16244">There are a couple of restless spirits that just don&apos;t want to stay down. I need someone strong and capable to put them back where they belong.</string>
  <string id="14374" soundid="16245">Eh-heh, don&apos;t worry, though, there&apos;ll be a little something in it for you, too. How does a fistful of silver each sound?</string>
  <string id="14375" soundid="16246">So, you interested?</string>
  <string id="14376" soundid="16247">Great! Eh-heh, now those ghosts will know who&apos;s boss around here! Eh-heh.</string>
  <string id="14377" soundid="160641"></string>
  <string id="14380" soundid="127582">Lord Yun has put out a call for aid. Will none of you answer?</string>
  <string id="14381" soundid="16252">Eh-heh, right then. Money always makes people come back, though.</string>
  <string id="14382" soundid="16253">If you change your mind, you can find me back at my house. That&apos;s where the money will be, eh-heheh.</string>
  <string id="14383">Clay Figure</string>
  <string id="14384">A small, virtually worthless clay figurine. Despite its lack of material value, the figurine is exquisite and strangely comforting to gaze upon.</string>
  <string id="14385">Didn&apos; hurt?</string>
  <string id="14387" soundid="127586">As I said, the trees in the Great Southern Forest sicken, and the paths fill with vicious ghosts.</string>
  <string id="14388" soundid="127587">No caravan dares to travel its depths, cutting off huge sections of the south from the Empire&apos;s heart, and Lord Yun collects no taxes when no one travels his lands.</string>
  <string id="14389" soundid="127588">You must leave Tien&apos;s Landing via the gate and follow the roadway to the north.</string>
  <string id="14390" soundid="127589">The path there is relatively safe, but travel beyond his camp and things worsen considerably.</string>
  <string id="14391" soundid="127590">Go safely, and remember what I&apos;ve said: Lord Yun needs the help of able warriors like yourself.</string>
  <string id="14392" soundid="127591">Are there no warriors among you?</string>
  <string id="14393" soundid="127592">Do none of you seek honor?</string>
  <string id="14394" soundid="127593">Will none of you brave the Great Southern Forest?</string>
  <string id="14395" soundid="127594">I hear you have spoken with Lord Yun. This is good news indeed.</string>
  <string id="14396" soundid="127595">If I find any others with some color to their liver, I will send them to aid you. To be fair, I doubt I will be successful.</string>
  <string id="14397" soundid="127596">Finally! Someone approaches me. I was worried that this town&apos;s courage had drained away with the water.</string>
  <string id="14398" soundid="127597">It puts me ill at ease to think that a lake could be restored more easily than a man&apos;s spirit.</string>
  <string id="14399" soundid="127598">You look like a man who is trained for combat. Would you like to put those skills to the test?</string>
  <string id="14400" soundid="127599">You seem a woman who knows her way around a battlefield. Are you willing to put those skills to the test?</string>
  <string id="14401" soundid="127600">Not personally, no. On behalf of Lord Yun, I&apos;m here to find a skilled warrior who can deal with a... unique problem.</string>
  <string id="14402" soundid="127601">A mercenary, are you? What else should I expect in this town? If you have the skills, then Lord Yun has the silver to pay for them.</string>
  <string id="14404" soundid="127602">You&apos;re insolent, but confident. You&apos;re exactly the kind of person Lord Yun is looking for, if you can watch your tongue in his presence.</string>
  <string id="14405" soundid="127603">The Great Southern Forest, which lies north of this village, suffers from a terrible disease.</string>
  <string id="14406" soundid="127604">Every tree within its borders sickens, and the place is infested with ghosts of all manners.</string>
  <string id="14407" soundid="127605">Lord Yun, my master, seeks a way to open the forest again and make it safe for travel. He is prepared to reward whoever aids him.</string>
  <string id="14408">Hah!</string>
  <string id="14409" soundid="127607">I must remain vigilant for skilled warriors. Sadly, resolve and spirit seem precious commodities in this isolated spit of a town....</string>
  <string id="14410" soundid="127608">The blighted forest cuts these peasants off from the heart of our Empire, but still they do nothing. Fools.</string>
  <string id="14411">Gonna get you!</string>
  <string id="14412">Now you&apos;re gonna get it!</string>
  <string id="14413">I&apos;m gonna beat your face in!</string>
  <string id="14414">Graah!</string>
  <string id="14415">HaHA!</string>
  <string id="14421">How do I reach the forest?</string>
  <string id="14423">Goodbye.</string>
  <string id="14426">You want to test me in combat?</string>
  <string id="14428">If enough silver&apos;s on the line, I&apos;m interested in whatever you have to say.</string>
  <string id="14430">Why should I waste my time on a man begging aid at the side of the street?</string>
  <string id="14433">Does anyone know what causes the sickness?</string>
  <string id="14434">That sounds like an expensive problem to resolve.</string>
  <string id="14435">You waste my time. I am no gardener!</string>
  <string id="14442">S&apos;better.</string>
  <string id="14443">Ohhh, that can&apos;t be good.</string>
  <string id="14444">Got ya!</string>
  <string id="14445">Tong</string>
  <string id="14448">What&apos;s happening in the forest again?</string>
  <string id="14449" soundid="16320">The grave-digging business sure is a killer, eh-heh.</string>
  <string id="14453">What do you want?</string>
  <string id="14454" soundid="146307">Your time is over, old man. Just die already! Kill him!</string>

  <string id="14462">Tell me about this job again.</string>
  <string id="14465">I&apos;ll do it.</string>
  <string id="14471">Not right now.</string>
  <string id="14477" soundid="109198">Master Radiant teaches patience and peace... what&apos;s the point? Why study for years to be a great fighter if you&apos;re not allowed to use your skills?</string>
  <string id="14486" soundid="127687">Jizu was... insane. He loved death. He hungered for it. He fed on it. Even his own, I guess. I wasn&apos;t thinking. I shouldn&apos;t have freed him first. Maybe not at all.</string>
  <string id="14487" soundid="127688">My spirit was bound to this place, trapped by the man who killed me. Strangler Jizu&apos;s hate kept me chained in death, just like I kept him chained in life.</string>
  <string id="14488" soundid="127689">But you destroyed Jizu. His hold on me is broken. My spirit is free. </string>

  <string id="14496" soundid="109200">Talk to First Brother Kai if you want to know more about the school.</string>
  <string id="14497">Jizu didn&apos;t know how to finish the job and disperse you properly. I do.</string>
  <string id="14498" soundid="189933">I believe there can be honor inside the Closed Fist and intrigue behind the Open Palm. The key is to understand why you act as you do. </string>

  <string id="14505" soundid="127703">I don&apos;t know who that man is, but he deserves to have something bad happen to him. We should see if there is a way we can help her.</string>
  <string id="14506" soundid="127704">The city can be a harsh place for children, but we don&apos;t have time to help them all.</string>
  <string id="14507" soundid="127705">She&apos;s all alone, with no one to help her. I think we should help her if we can.</string>

  <string id="14511" soundid="127709">A difficult situation to be placed in. I hope we are up for the challenge.</string>
  <string id="14512" soundid="127710">Slave traders! If there&apos;s one thing I can&apos;t abide, it&apos;s slavers. We have to  put an end to their trading.</string>
  <string id="14513" soundid="109201">I&apos;ve already told you more than I should. Now, do you want to fight or not?</string>
  <string id="14514" soundid="127711">Do we have time to deal with this? I didn&apos;t agree to join you so we could solve everyone else&apos;s problems.</string>
  <string id="14515" soundid="127712">It&apos;s a noble idea, trying to help this Songtao, but I have a feeling it&apos;s going to be more trouble than it&apos;s worth.</string>
  <string id="14516" soundid="127713">The least he could have done is bought us some wine.</string>
  <string id="14517" soundid="127714">That was very noble of you. I&apos;ve never known anyone else who would risk so much to help a complete stranger. You surprised even me.</string>
  <string id="14518" soundid="127715">I feel much better knowing those slavers have been shut down. If only I had known you when my daughter was taken from me.</string>
  <string id="14519" soundid="127716">That was a lot of work for very little reward. You certainly have a strange way of going about things.</string>
  <string id="14521" soundid="127717">He better pay handsomely for all the trouble he&apos;s put us through.</string>
  <string id="14522" soundid="127718">I can&apos;t believe you let him go... and accused Songtao! And for what? For a little money. Your casual concern for the truth disturbs me.</string>
  <string id="14523" soundid="127719">The only good thing to come of this is the fact that the slavers are closing their doors. But they&apos;ll return... they always do. But you could have stopped them.</string>
  <string id="14524" soundid="127720">Well, at least that&apos;s out of the way. Now we need to find evidence of our own... unless you&apos;ve forgotten completely about Death&apos;s Hand and my father.</string>
  <string id="14525" soundid="127721">Well, that turned out more profitable than I would have imagined.</string>

  <string id="14626" soundid="65769"></string>
  <string id="14627" soundid="65770">Indeed, I suspect that the true story lies in how far north the Emperor&apos;s reach has spread.</string>

  <string id="14629" soundid="65772"></string>
  <string id="14631" soundid="65774">It seems to me that some part of your story remains untold. Do my questions block the truth?</string>
  <string id="14632" soundid="65775">Tell me this, if nothing else, good lady. When the cry for peace rose up, who was it that our great Emperor turned to?</string>
  <string id="14633" soundid="65776">Two Drops the Poisoner? He is considered a great confidant of the Emperor, I believe.</string>
  <string id="14636" soundid="65779">The heavens had turned to him? These words, are they riddles? </string>
  <string id="14637" soundid="65780">The lady plays at games that are not appreciated at the court. You were... *are* but a representative of your people, not one of the Emperor&apos;s closest advisors.</string>
  <string id="14638" soundid="65781">The... very earth spoke to him. I can believe this, for the Emperor has always been very aware of his place in this world.</string>
  <string id="14641" soundid="65784">Alone! This is insufferable! Where were his guards?</string>
  <string id="14644" soundid="65787">Wait! What word is this from the front?</string>
  <string id="14645" soundid="65788">What happened to cease the expansion of the Empire, dear lady?</string>
  <string id="14646" soundid="65789">Pfaw! The Horselords would have been crushed.</string>
  <string id="14647" soundid="65790">Bored! To think that.... I question our lady&apos;s dedication to the Empire. The reports I have here indicate that the Emperor was halted by a celestial event of great portent!</string>
  <string id="14648" soundid="65791">This report has it that the Emperor&apos;s advance was halted by a celestial event. The brightest of shooting stars tracing a path across the northern sky.</string>
  <string id="14649" soundid="65792">That... must be a metaphor. I read here that a shooting star traced a bright path across the sky.</string>
  <string id="14650" soundid="65793">A celestial event? Most auspicious!</string>
  <string id="14651" soundid="65794">And so our most noble Emperor saw a sign from the heavens. Our mighty armies poised to crush the Horselords and stretch the Empire to the ends of the earth, but we stopped.</string>

  <string id="14873" soundid="16776">Your debate with the Outlander showed great understanding and intelligence. I hope you are equally proficient at combat.</string>
  <string id="14876" soundid="16779">He balks at our attempts to calm him and answers requests for payment with strange coins of questionable value. He needs to go. </string>
  <string id="14877" soundid="16780">The Outlander is not a dignitary or a traveling merchant. He is a parody of civilized behavior. He spews insults at the Emperor himself!</string>
  <string id="14879">Commoner</string>
  <string id="14880" soundid="16783">That&apos;s what&apos;s so infuriating! He doesn&apos;t respond to reason! He proposes challenges we don&apos;t understand and then declares himself the winner.</string>
  <string id="14881" soundid="16784">Several of our brightest have faced him, but as soon as they get the better of him, he sets off his strange firework and says they are beaten.</string>
  <string id="14882" soundid="16785">Normally the peasants like it when we intellectuals are maligned, but they tire of his presence, too. Getting rid of this nuisance will endear you to many.</string>
  <string id="14883" soundid="16786">I hope your ability matches your conviction. Several others have fallen short, despite their outrage at his antics.</string>
  <string id="14884" soundid="16787">That is not the conviction I was hoping for, but no one else has been able to help, so it will have to do. At your convenience, then.</string>
  <string id="14885" soundid="16788">He is in the Scholars&apos; Garden, and no amount of opposition has moved him. Please, I hope you will prove to be a worthy opponent.</string>
  <string id="14886" soundid="16789">I had hoped you would be more supportive of your culture, but if that is your decision, I will not waste my breath on you.</string>
  <string id="14887" soundid="16790">If you change your mind, however, I doubt the Outlander will be leaving soon. He lectures continually in the Scholars&apos; Garden. No one can dislodge him.</string>
  <string id="14888" soundid="16791">He has refused to move a muscle until someone meets his terms. He proposes challenges we don&apos;t understand and then declares himself the winner.</string>
  <string id="14889" soundid="16792">We don&apos;t want a murder. We just want order restored. But he doesn&apos;t respond like we do; he proposes challenges we don&apos;t understand and then declares himself the winner.</string>
  <string id="14895" soundid="16798">Everyone here overheard your talk with the Outlander. Why did you refuse his test? Weren&apos;t you disgusted by his insults?</string>
  <string id="14896" soundid="16799">I heard you accept the Outlander&apos;s challenge. I am grateful you have seen fit to defend us all.</string>
  <string id="14897" soundid="16800">Is there something else I can do for you? We eagerly await word of your progress with the Outlander.</string>
  <string id="14899" soundid="161114">We are perfection! Servants of the Mother, an ancient demon of great strength!</string>

  <string id="14905">Perhaps I can reason with this Outlander.</string>
  <string id="14908">I will teach him not to mock our culture.</string>
  <string id="14910">Maybe when I have time. Leave me.</string>
  <string id="14912">If that&apos;s all I&apos;ll gain, then my answer is no.</string>
  <string id="14914">I&apos;ll send him packing.</string>
  <string id="14916">Should I just kill him outright?</string>

  <string id="15050" soundid="16958">You have the keen eyes of an educated man. Know the ins and outs of philosophical debate, do you? Well, what about your twos and fours? What of them?</string>
  <string id="15051" soundid="16959">Ah, you look quick with your fists, but I&apos;ll wager your head falls behind. Too much time slapping each other and not enough time strapped to a desk in a decent classroom.</string>
  <string id="15056" soundid="16964">As amusing as your savage dances are, once again I have proven the superiority of setting your nose to the grindstone and not mucking about. </string>
  <string id="15057" soundid="16965">Now, bring some refreshments in a proper mug, or I&apos;ll take back the coins of my home and country! Don&apos;t you heathens know the worth of a proper king&apos;s halfpenny!</string>
  <string id="15058" soundid="16966">Er, generous visitor, if our customs are so displeasing to you, perhaps you should find lodging elsewhere?</string>
  <string id="15059" soundid="16967">Please?</string>
  <string id="15060" soundid="16968">And leave you lot to your primitive ways? Tell them what I think of that, squire Percival.</string>
  <string id="15061" soundid="16969">Good lad. Found him wading in the mud planting weeds. You can&apos;t keep your crackers crisp doing that! God help you if you don&apos;t know the horror of a soggy biscuit.</string>
  <string id="15062" soundid="16970">I&apos;ve given him dignity, and unless one of you has the will to deny that I&apos;m your better, I suggest you start learning. We&apos;ll have you in proper trousers by the morrow.</string>
  <string id="15063" soundid="16971">Eh, what&apos;s that? Someone stepping to the fore? Let&apos;s have a look at you.</string>
  <string id="15064" soundid="16972">A woman? My dear, I&apos;m not sure what topsy cradle you fell from, but in my country a lady knows her place. Unless she&apos;s queen.</string>
  <string id="15065" soundid="16973">The simple truth is that I have bested every one of you who has come forward, whether in tests of wit or combat. You face a champion of king and country.</string>
  <string id="15066" soundid="16974">Now, I didn&apos;t ask to land here, but if a storm is going to cast my ship into the very heart of such a dark empire, I&apos;ll bring the light of knowledge wherever I can.</string>
  <string id="15067" soundid="16975">You must hunger for guidance. You&apos;re like children. I mean, only a handful of you can even grow a decent moustache! What kind of place is this?</string>
  <string id="15068" soundid="16976">Can you now? Shall we put that to a test? I welcome the chance that you might impress me with a glimmer of intelligent insight.</string>
  <string id="15069" soundid="16977">But, I will acknowledge that I am likely to disagree just because I know you are... lacking. We will need educated men to judge the merits of our arguments.</string>
  <string id="15070" soundid="16978">You have nothing to prove because you have nothing at all. Where are your towering halls of business? Where are the great open mines that fuel a healthy land?</string>
  <string id="15071" soundid="16979">And what, pray tell with honesty, do you think you are doing with that great bloody palace floating in the sky? That is just wrong in any right-thinking country!</string>
  <string id="15072" soundid="16980">So be it. If you don&apos;t want to learn, just step away and let me lead by example. I&apos;ll drag this land to respectability one mind at a time if I have to.</string>
  <string id="15073" soundid="16981">Is that your answer? To throw yourself into mindless combat? That only proves my point. The lot of you could bury me with bodies, but I&apos;ll still be your better.</string>
  <string id="15074" soundid="16982">But, if you want to bring more to the table--and a decent height table, none of this *kneeling* malarkey--I will grant you a chance to prove you are adequate.</string>
  <string id="15075" soundid="16983">Ah, you&apos;re a large fellow, aren&apos;t you? Certainly room enough for brains in there, but I doubt if you have any more sense than the rest of this crowd.</string>
  <string id="15083">Who are you to judge? Some barbarian from outside the Empire.</string>
  <string id="15084">You insult a noble and ancient people, Outlander.</string>
  <string id="15095">Sir, your arrogance is astounding. We are a cultured people.</string>
  <string id="15100">You blind yourself with prejudice. I can prove you wrong.</string>
  <string id="15102">Arguments? What kind of contest are you looking for?</string>
  <string id="15103">Explore Mode</string>
  <string id="15104">Some sort of debate? Are you afraid to face me in battle?</string>
  <string id="15105">We have nothing to prove to you.</string>
  <string id="15107">I have no interest in this contest. You are not worth debating. </string>
  <string id="15108">I&apos;ll make you eat those words, Outlander!</string>
  <string id="15346" soundid="17434">Then, we&apos;ll see how you fare in combat. I doubt you&apos;ll do very well. Like the rest, you&apos;re all just too damn skinny.</string>
  <string id="15347" soundid="17435">It&apos;s more likely I&apos;ll teach the rest by making an example of you. Here, these five standing about will be our judges. They look like a varied lot.</string>
  <string id="15348" soundid="17436">Not until you&apos;ve earned the right. Your people claim to be honorable. If you attack without my agreement, you&apos;ll have proved my point.</string>
  <string id="15349" soundid="17437">You&apos;ve already seen the results of that. The young man before you wanted to progress to combat without meeting my conditions. I soundly put him down.</string>
  <string id="15350" soundid="17438">So, for all your complaints about me being closed-minded, you refuse to debate me? It&apos;s as I said; you are a backward and unenlightened people.</string>
  <string id="15351" soundid="17439">Return when you have the spine to put your mind to the test. Until then, go plant a field or some such.</string>
  <string id="15352" soundid="17440">Haw! Any dog can bite, but very few can speak. I&apos;ve gone to pains to learn your barbaric tongue, only to find that none of you has much to say.</string>
  <string id="15353" soundid="17441">Have you changed your mind? Are you willing to debate the heart of your supposedly enlightened culture? We&apos;ll follow that with a test of physical prowess, as well.</string>
  <string id="15354" soundid="17442">You do your countrymen no favors. So be it. I&apos;ll go back to schooling these fools on the proper way to deliver a timely brew. Bowls are for soup, you curs!</string>
  <string id="15355" soundid="17443">Good! I don&apos;t want to set you off your game, but I thought we should ensure that the process was more entertaining than a simple checklist of virtue.</string>
  <string id="15357" soundid="17445">I just want to make sure this is more entertaining than simply blathering about whose walls are higher or whose philosophers really know what&apos;s what.</string>
  <string id="15359" soundid="44293">The best course is to appeal to the individual preferences of the judges. We are... theoretical thinkers, really.</string>
  <string id="15360" soundid="17448">I&apos;ve gone to great pains to learn your barbaric tongue, only to find that none of you have much to say. Can you convince me otherwise?</string>
  <string id="15361" soundid="17449">I&apos;ve heard a distinct lack of couplets and quatrains, to say nothing of pentameters. Is it any wonder you people live as you do?</string>
  <string id="15362" soundid="17450">I charge you with defending the heart of your people. If a group of judges determines that you have adequately done so, I will declare you the winner.</string>
  <string id="15363" soundid="17451">Er, whoever you wish. These five, standing here. I&apos;m sure there will be a balance of opinion. The test must be fair.</string>
  <string id="15365" soundid="17453">Go on, talk to them all to prove I haven&apos;t coerced them. We&apos;ll begin the debate when you are ready.</string>
  <string id="15366">I&apos;ll humiliate you here and in combat later.</string>
  <string id="15368">Bah, this is no way to compete! Let combat decide!</string>
  <string id="15370">I don&apos;t agree to this. It&apos;s a waste of time.</string>
  <string id="15374">As I said, it&apos;s a waste of my time.</string>
  <string id="15375">I will abide by whatever requirement you set.</string>
  <string id="15379">What kind of change are you planning?</string>
  <string id="15383">Very well. I will agree to this. Who shall judge?</string>
  <string id="15388" soundid="122805">All right. Goodbye.</string>
  <string id="15389" soundid="17478">Each time you delay, he spends another hour insulting the very heart of our people. Please, if you are going to help, do so soon.</string>
  <string id="15390" soundid="17479">This is not an issue of name-calling. If he returns to whatever barbarian king he follows and says that we are simple and weak, who knows what might happen?</string>
  <string id="15391" soundid="17480">We can&apos;t keep him cooped up in here forever. Sooner or later he&apos;ll attract the attention of the Lotus Assassins. That&apos;s bad for all of us. Please reconsider.</string>
  <string id="15392" soundid="17481">I would be honored to sit in judgment of the debate. Several of my fellow scholars have also volunteered.</string>
  <string id="15393" soundid="17482">To do otherwise would only help the Outlander win in the long run. If he wants a true debate, we will allow it to progress fairly.</string>
  <string id="15394" soundid="17483">Of course, I doubt his arguments will have the weight that he expects. Not here in the heart of the Jade Empire.</string>
  <string id="15395" soundid="17484">No. That would only prove his accusations that we cannot defend our culture on fair terms. We can&apos;t give in to that temptation.</string>
  <string id="15396" soundid="17485">It is unfortunate that you could not defeat the Outlander in the debate. I had hoped he would come to understand us.</string>
  <string id="15398">Thug</string>
  <string id="15399">I should be going.</string>
  <string id="15401">Nothing, thanks. Goodbye.</string>
  <string id="15402">No, thanks. Goodbye.</string>
  <string id="15403">I will get to it. Give me time.</string>
  <string id="15404">I am beyond his petty attacks.</string>
  <string id="15407">I trust you will judge fairly?</string>
  <string id="15409">This will be simple. Just agree with everything I say.</string>

  <string id="15589" soundid="112519">We&apos;re free! We&apos;re free!</string>
  <string id="15590" soundid="112520">Let&apos;s get out of here!</string>
  <string id="15604" soundid="145673">Not as such. The Lotus Assassins want to deal with this traitor personally. I don&apos;t envy anyone who has attracted that kind of attention.</string>

  <string id="17540" soundid="114510">It won&apos;t be quite that easy. I&apos;ve watched Dutong for quite a while, and when he&apos;s drinking he usually goes through three stages of drunkenness.</string>
  <string id="17541" soundid="114511">Don&apos;t worry about that. He never passes out, no matter how much he drinks. Actually, he usually goes through three stages of drunkenness.</string>
  <string id="17542" soundid="114512">Yeah, I guess there&apos;s nothing we can do now. So, anything else you need? Want some free advice? I could use the practice.</string>
  <string id="17543" soundid="114513">Old Mother Kwan used to run the place, until Dutong bought it. Well, &quot;buy&quot; isn&apos;t quite right.... It&apos;s complicated. Talk to Mother Kwan if you want the whole story.</string>
  <string id="17544" soundid="114514">I used to steep the tea here. They called me Steeper Yanru. But now Dutong says I&apos;m going to be the new barkeep. I&apos;ll have to give out advice and wine in equal doses.</string>
  <string id="17545" soundid="114515">I shouldn&apos;t speak ill of my boss, but I don&apos;t trust him. Maybe it&apos;s because he&apos;s not from the town. He just showed up one day with that Imperial Writ and took over.</string>
  <string id="17546" soundid="114516">I can&apos;t say too much about him. He&apos;s my boss, after all. Mostly, he just sits in the corner and drinks his wine until he gets drunk.</string>
  <string id="17547" soundid="114517">It&apos;s a shame Mother Kwan had to give the place up. She didn&apos;t waste her days getting drunk, and she didn&apos;t make me practice giving out advice all day so I could become a barkeep!</string>
  <string id="17548" soundid="114518">It&apos;s complicated. If you want the whole story, talk to Old Mother Kwan. I&apos;ll just keep practicing my advice.</string>
  <string id="17549" soundid="116153">The sailors are gone, and the river is back to normal. Things are finally looking up in Tien&apos;s Landing!</string>
  <string id="17550" soundid="116154">It isn&apos;t safe for a young lady in Tien&apos;s Landing anymore. Not with so many drunken sailors around.</string>
  <string id="17551" soundid="114519">You should tell Mother Kwan you got her teahouse back for her. I can&apos;t wait until she&apos;s back in charge.</string>
  <string id="17552" soundid="114520">The restorative tastes pretty foul, but it does the job. Works instantly and makes a man sober as an Imperial Judge. Dutong&apos;s guard keeps a vial handy at all times, just in case.</string>
  <string id="17553" soundid="114521">The guard gave me a few vials so I could slip them into Dutong&apos;s wine when he starts to get paranoid. Keeps him from getting out of hand.</string>
  <string id="17554" soundid="114522">Good, good. Go speak to Dutong. If he&apos;s not drunk enough, or if he&apos;s too drunk, come back and see me, and I&apos;ll mix him up another drink.</string>
  <string id="17555" soundid="114523">We&apos;ll get him to admit he&apos;s a cheat and a sneak! Then Old Mother Kwan will be back in charge, and I won&apos;t ever have to give out another bit of bad advice!</string>
  <string id="17556" soundid="114524">But... but you said you&apos;d help. You said you&apos;d get Dutong to confess. Please... don&apos;t give up now! I hate working for him! I don&apos;t want to go back to giving out bad advice.</string>
  <string id="17557" soundid="114525">Just... just think about it, okay? And if you need any help with Dutong--getting him drunk, sobering him up--you come see me.</string>
  <string id="17558" soundid="114526">That Imperial Writ has caused us no amount of grief. Mother Kwan lost her teahouse, Waitress Yanwan is busier than ever, and I spend all day giving out foolish advice.</string>
  <string id="17559" soundid="114527">Mother Kwan saw it, though her eyes aren&apos;t too good. Most of us didn&apos;t bother to give it a look, since hardly anyone in the town can read anyway.</string>
  <string id="17560" soundid="114528">What? You mean... it wasn&apos;t real? That means Mother Kwan should still own the teahouse!</string>
  <string id="17561" soundid="114529">Problem is, Dutong&apos;s already shown everyone the writ, and now he&apos;s got it locked away. If you&apos;re right, he&apos;d never bring it out again. There&apos;s no way to prove he cheated Mother Kwan.</string>
  <string id="17562" soundid="114530">That... that might work. It would probably help if you get him drunk, first. That&apos;s something I can help you with. Dutong&apos;s always having me send over wine.</string>
  <string id="17565">Tell me about this restorative potion.</string>
  <string id="17566">I&apos;ll be back in a bit.</string>
  <string id="17569">I don&apos;t have time to help Mother Kwan.</string>
  <string id="17572">I want to talk about Dutong and his Imperial Writ.</string>
  <string id="17573" soundid="116155">I know he&apos;s an Imperial Minister, but if you ask me, Sheng is completely incompetent. </string>
  <string id="17574" soundid="116156">It&apos;s good to have things back the way they were. Mother Kwan is a much better owner than Dutong.</string>
  <string id="17575" soundid="116157">If Three Sheets keeps running this place so poorly, he&apos;s going to lose his customers!</string>
  <string id="17576" soundid="116158">Did you hear? The pirates are gone. Somebody wiped out the whole lot of them. Good riddance, I say!</string>
  <string id="17577" soundid="116159">My cousin disappeared last month. Nobody knows for sure, but I bet the pirates took him!</string>
  <string id="17578" soundid="116160">I was afraid those sailors would never leave! Now that they&apos;re gone, things can get back to normal.</string>
  <string id="17579" soundid="116161">If Sheng doesn&apos;t do something about those sailors soon, they&apos;ll overrun the whole town.</string>
  <string id="17580" soundid="116162">I hoped Minister Sheng had come here looking for a wife, but all he wants is to get back to the Imperial City.</string>
  <string id="17581" soundid="116163">You did a good thing, helping Old Mother Kwan out. We&apos;re all grateful.</string>
  <string id="17582">Did anyone ever see the actual writ?</string>
  <string id="17583">I think the writ was a forgery!</string>
  <string id="17584" soundid="116164">Old Mother Kwan has nothing now. She should&apos;ve grabbed herself a husband when she had the chance!</string>
  <string id="17585" soundid="116168">I heard the ruins are haunted by the ghosts of those who died in the flood.</string>
  <string id="17586" soundid="116166">The river is rising again. There&apos;s bound to be some good marriage prospects coming in soon!</string>
  <string id="17588">Maybe I can make Dutong confess.</string>
  <string id="17590">Get him drunk and I&apos;ll get a confession out of him.</string>
  <string id="17592">Just don&apos;t get him so drunk he passes out.</string>
  <string id="17596" soundid="41563">Ah, once more you try to restore me. My lost family was just one more tool. If they had ever meant more than that, I would have been present when they fell.</string>
  <string id="17597" soundid="41564">I killed hundreds of your kind, thousands, just for the *chance* to become a god. I can&apos;t let you live now that I *am* one! I am more than Sun Hai ever was!</string>
  <string id="17599" soundid="138363">Hello. You aren&apos;t welcome here. You should leave.</string>
  <string id="17600" soundid="41567">Do you? What am I?</string>
  <string id="17601" soundid="41568">Oh, very lofty. I am the scourge that must be destroyed. Why? What have I done, Spirit Monk? Because of me, the Empire has water. I deserve to lead it.</string>
  <string id="17602" soundid="41569">Is that all, Spirit Monk? I was sure you would present some lofty ideal, hoping a twinge of conscience would weaken my resolve.</string>
  <string id="17603" soundid="41570">I see. So you will take advantage of all the planning I have done and attempt to steal my destiny, Spirit Monk?</string>
  <string id="17604" soundid="41571">Just a man? No, I don&apos;t think so. If the last Spirit Monk must return from the dead to oppose me, I am far more than that.</string>
  <string id="17605" soundid="41572">Does it? Does it really? No, Spirit Monk, I am far from beaten.</string>
  <string id="17606" soundid="41573">An impressive display. Your star shines bright, but it is still trapped within a mortal body.</string>
  <string id="17607" soundid="41574">Once again, I misunderstand. The raw energy... you are far too resistant to it.</string>
  <string id="17611">Will you not give one last thought to your family?</string>
  <string id="17615">And you have surprised me, but I know what you are now.</string>
  <string id="17616">A taint to be excised.</string>
  <string id="17618">A long-suffered headache.</string>
  <string id="17620">A rival to cast aside.</string>
  <string id="17622">Just a man, and you need to be reminded of it.</string>
  <string id="17624">Cease your prattling, Li. This ends now. </string>
  <string id="17626" soundid="41593"></string>
  <string id="17627" soundid="41594">You have come. Destiny set this moment in motion, but from here, your choices are your own to make.</string>
  <string id="17628" soundid="41595">For some things this is true, but if you look too closely at the current crisis alone, you risk upsetting a greater balance. That was the mistake made here.</string>

  <string id="17636" soundid="41603">This is what he has done. This is what your Master Li allowed. For twenty years my body has bled, separate from the spirit, feeding the Empire and the Emperor.</string>
  <string id="17637" soundid="41604">It is an agony that you cannot fathom. To have fallen so far into the hands of men. Rebirth is impossible while this continues.</string>
  <string id="17638" soundid="41605"></string>
  <string id="17639" soundid="41606">By all the heavens!</string>

  <string id="17641" soundid="41608">Forgive us, Great Dragon. Our mortal kin are ignorant, foolish, unkind. These crimes will not go unanswered.</string>
  <string id="17642" soundid="41609">You small creatures, you heard the sounds of battle, but are you truly prepared? What will become of your world if my kind fall to the same evils that plague you?</string>
  <string id="17643" soundid="178067">Your Master commands that you find her; if not to bring her back, then to teach her captor that this will not be tolerated. Gao insults your accomplishments with this action.</string>
  <string id="17644" soundid="41611">Your Master Li must be stopped. The Empire must find balance without the flow of heart-water he has unleashed.</string>
  <string id="17645" soundid="41612">The reign of Emperor Sun saw my abuse, but Sun Li the Glorious Strategist laid the plans. One could not occur without the other.</string>
  <string id="17646" soundid="41613">It was never his intent to let brother Hai rule. Had his plan initially succeeded, your Master would be Emperor, and you would have been destroyed with the others of your kind.</string>
  <string id="17647" soundid="41614">I feel as though this could absolve my father of blame, but seeing what was done here.... He was beyond my help.</string>
  <string id="17648" soundid="41615">You are a Spirit Monk, charged with guarding the order of things. You were not born to this role, but as the last, a solemn duty falls at your feet.</string>
  <string id="17649" soundid="41616">I cannot be healed. My body has been cut open, my heart removed. I should rejoin the Great Wheel, but I am defiled and cannot rest.</string>
  <string id="17650" soundid="41617">Rebirth can only come when my essence is free. To defeat your Master, you must stop the power he draws from me. Soon he will be too strong, even for you.</string>
  <string id="17652" soundid="41619">Your Master abuses the amulet he took from you. His brother did not have that luxury, so he needed to draw my essence slowly. The toll on his body was grave.</string>
  <string id="17653" soundid="41620">Emperor Sun did not have the amulet. He had to draw my essence slowly, or it would overwhelm him. Even so, it took a horrible toll on his body.</string>
  <string id="17654" soundid="41621">Your Master does not have to be so cautious. The amulet is not a source of power, but it *is* a focus.</string>
  <string id="17655" soundid="41622">He partakes of energy that mortals were never meant to hold. He laps at it greedily, expecting your return.</string>
  <string id="17656" soundid="41623">You must destroy the source of that power. You must destroy my body. When he falls, all that is mine will then rejoin my spirit. Rebirth.</string>
  <string id="17657" soundid="41624">There is no other decision to make. This desecration... we must undo it.</string>
  <string id="17658" soundid="41625">Then let it be so. Take hold of a blade, Spirit Monk, and let it strike true. Destroy the machine that maintains this abomination.</string>
  <string id="17659" soundid="41626">The Great Wheel must turn.</string>
  <string id="17661">Defeat the Spirits of your Classmates</string>
  <string id="17662" soundid="41629">It is the wisest decision. A pity such power could not have been put to constructive use.</string>
  <string id="17663" soundid="41630">A good step toward rectifying this desecration.</string>
  <string id="17664" soundid="41631">It is clear that nobody involved had the will to properly command this energy. So be it.</string>
  <string id="17665" soundid="41632">To what end? Look what has become of our Master. Look what he has been a part of.</string>
  <string id="17666" soundid="41633">Beware what you say, for you are still mortal and open to the same weaknesses he and his brothers displayed!</string>
  <string id="17667" soundid="41634">It seems that you learned your lessons in the spirit realm a little too well. Yes, blood from your mortal companions *could* be used to poison my body.</string>
  <string id="17668" soundid="41635">The energy flowing to Sun Li would be disrupted, making him vulnerable. Defeat him and my power would remain trapped in this body for you to use.</string>

  <string id="18525" soundid="20885">Yes, I can do that. Whatever you want.</string>
  <string id="18526" soundid="20886">Who? The woman? She got loose from the sack and ran into the cave. Would have been safer out here with us.</string>
  <string id="18527" soundid="20887">Gao told us to go after her, but we said no. There are... things in there. We fought one while he was in the village.</string>
  <string id="18528" soundid="20888">We refused to go after her, so Gao went himself. </string>
  <string id="18529" soundid="20889">I don&apos;t know. He just said it was very important that he get her tonight. He brought a few groups of us over for it.</string>
  <string id="18530" soundid="20890">We didn&apos;t take her; we made Gao do that himself. I know we shouldn&apos;t have let him talk us into any of this, but he doubled our pay.</string>
  <string id="18531" soundid="20891">It was just one woman. Compared to some things... well, all I&apos;ll say is that this wasn&apos;t the worst thing done by a Gao lately.</string>

  <string id="18542" soundid="20902">You&apos;ve never seen that kind of thing out here on the borderlands, but Gao has inventors that can make all kinds of things.</string>

  <string id="18655" soundid="37285">Welcome, stranger. Welcome to beautiful Tien&apos;s Landing. Isn&apos;t it a glorious day? Oh, I know people complain and grumble, but honestly, I think they&apos;re overreacting.</string>
  <string id="18656" soundid="39145">Now that the Great Dam is closed, I&apos;ll bet the square is just bustling with crowds... or soon will be. Yes, things are definitely looking up for Tien&apos;s Landing.</string>
  <string id="18658" soundid="37288">When the dam was closed, people said the town was dying. But not me! I was the only one who said things would get better... and they did!</string>
  <string id="18659" soundid="37289">I have no doubt the pirates will be dealt with soon, as well. Things always look up eventually. It reminds me of an old saying my father taught me.</string>
  <string id="18660">Old Mother Kwan owned the teahouse in Tien&apos;s Landing until Three Sheets Dutong showed up with an Imperial Writ proclaiming that the teahouse was his. Dutong&apos;s story sounds suspicious and is probably worth investigating.</string>
  <string id="18661" soundid="37291">When we first heard reports of pirates raiding nearby villages, everybody said the town was doomed. But I knew things would improve, and now the pirates are gone!</string>
  <string id="18662" soundid="37292">No doubt the dam will soon be closed, too. Things always get better. It reminds me of an old saying my father taught me.</string>
  <string id="18663">Old Mother Kwan</string>
  <string id="18664" soundid="37294">The dam is closed, the pirates are gone, and life is good in Tien&apos;s Landing once again! Not that I&apos;m surprised... not at all.</string>
  <string id="18665" soundid="37295">Everybody else was all doom and gloom. Some even wanted to leave the town. But not me. I knew everything would work out... and now things are better than ever!</string>
  <string id="18667" soundid="37297">I see you are still here, honored one. I am glad to see that you are enjoying our town! Don&apos;t let the doomsayers convince you that things are not going well here!</string>
  <string id="18669" soundid="37299">The Great Dam has been opened, and the river level has dropped. Ships can&apos;t navigate the river, and nobody can fish. But I think people are overreacting.</string>
  <string id="18670" soundid="37300">Basically, we are suffering some minor inconveniences, which I am sure will soon be resolved. Still, there are a few alarmists who scream and cry that our town is dying.</string>
  <string id="18674">Investigate Dutong&apos;s Writ</string>
  <string id="18675">Speak to Dutong or the teahouse staff to learn more about Dutong&apos;s Imperial Writ.</string>
  <string id="18676">Old Mother Kwan used to own the teahouse in Tien&apos;s Landing, until Three Sheets Dutong showed up with an Imperial Writ proclaiming that the teahouse was his. Dutong&apos;s story sounds suspicious and is probably worth investigating.</string>
  <string id="18677">Steeper Yanru believes Dutong is lying about the writ. He has agreed to help you get Dutong drunk so he&apos;ll confess his crimes.</string>
  <string id="18678">Get Dutong Drunk</string>
  <string id="18679" soundid="128716">You&apos;re awake! It sounds like the army is on the move. They&apos;re on their way up the mountain!</string>
  <string id="18680" soundid="122942">Oh, yes of course. I tend to get carried away sometimes.</string>
  <string id="18681">I need to get going.</string>
  <string id="18682">Can we get back to my other questions?</string>
  <string id="18683" soundid="122945">Farther down toward the city, you&apos;ll find the Golden Way. Many wealthy people live and work there--hopefully some willing to fund one of my inventions.</string>
  <string id="18684" soundid="122946">Then there&apos;s the Market District, near where you landed earlier. Most of the city does its business there. It&apos;s an interesting place--at least, *I* think so.</string>
  <string id="18687">Speak with Yanru and convince him to send drinks to Dutong and get him drunk enough to confess.</string>
  <string id="18691" soundid="37321">Of course, with the dam open, ships can&apos;t navigate the river. So I have no supplies to make my baskets, and no customers to buy them. But am I worried? Of course not.</string>
  <string id="18692" soundid="37322">People are worried about the pirates. Sure, they raid villages and sell their captives to slavers. But they don&apos;t bother us here in Tien&apos;s Landing.</string>
  <string id="18694" soundid="37324">Now that the dam is closed, supplies will start coming back into town. In a week, two at most, I&apos;ll be able to go back to making baskets. We&apos;ll be fine until then.</string>
  <string id="18695" soundid="37325">I&apos;m always happy to talk about Tien&apos;s Landing. We may have a few minor problems, but I&apos;m sure Sheng, our Imperial Minister, will find a way to solve them.</string>
  <string id="18697" soundid="37327">A splendid question, and one in which I am particularly well versed. It is a fascinating tale that dates back to the blessed first Emperor of Jade, Sagacious Tien.</string>
  <string id="18699" soundid="37329">To honor the memory of his dream, he returned and built a summer palace in the spot where he had stopped to rest. In time, a town--this town--sprang up around the palace.</string>
  <string id="18700" soundid="37330">Well, that was long ago. Over the centuries the castle fell into ruin. But make no mistake: Tien&apos;s Landing is where he had his dream. The castle proves it.</string>

  <string id="18959">Let&apos;s settle this, Gao. One on one.</string>
  <string id="18960">Commoner</string>
  <string id="18961">I&apos;m getting sick of your raving, Gao.</string>
  <string id="18962">Empty threats from a beaten man.</string>
  <string id="18964">You took something very important to me. I&apos;d follow you forever.</string>
  <string id="18966">Wasting my time on another errand, and all because of you.</string>
  <string id="19028" soundid="21389">Go away.</string>
  <string id="19029" soundid="21390">You&apos;ve done it all, youngster. You&apos;ve saved an entire town. You are the hero we needed eighteen years ago. Better late than never, eh?</string>
  <string id="19033" soundid="21394">Eighteen years ago, Emperor Sun was young and flush with success from ending the drought. He began public works all over the Empire, including the Great Dam down-river.</string>
  <string id="19034" soundid="21395">The workmen came and started building it near our town. We were not engineers and so we were not sure what it would mean. Some worried that it might flood us out.</string>
  <string id="19036" soundid="21397">Most were unconcerned. After all, if there were any danger the Emperor would tell us, surely. One day, the Great Dam was finished. And the floodgates were closed.</string>
  <string id="19037" soundid="21398">The town... the town flooded. We took what we could and fled. Mothers ran about screaming for their children who had gone out to play. Children screamed for their dogs.</string>
  <string id="19038" soundid="21399">Some folks climbed to the roofs of their houses and refused to leave. We survivors straggled upriver... some collapsed from exhaustion, but the water kept rising.</string>
  <string id="19040" soundid="21401">I carried a boy and a girl. I saw another boy fall, but I couldn&apos;t carry him. Finally, I fell over too. When I woke, I found the water had stopped rising.</string>
  <string id="19041" soundid="21402">The Great Dam had created an enormous lake, and we settled our new town on the banks. The lake completely covered the ruins of our town.</string>
  <string id="19042" soundid="21403">The crewmen who manned the Great Dam would come to town sometimes, but they knew no more than we. I will go to my grave never knowing.</string>
  <string id="19044" soundid="21405">The people started a new life here. But there was much pain and sorrow. Conversations would trail off. At night you could hear women sobbing... and not a few men.</string>
  <string id="19045" soundid="21406">Finally, people stopped talking about the past, and then they refused to talk about it all together. Eventually they pretended it never happened.</string>
  <string id="19046" soundid="21407">You look like you know how to fight. You look like you can stand up for yourself. So you don&apos;t understand: We are villagers.</string>
  <string id="19047" soundid="21408">We farm and fish. We live at the mercy of the gods, nature, and the Emperor. If one or all of these masters is kind, it is good.</string>
  <string id="19048" soundid="21409">If one or all choose to be cruel, well, there&apos;s nothing we can do about it. We just have to get the fish hauled in.</string>
  <string id="19049" soundid="21410">Mm. A few months ago, the Emperor&apos;s engineers and soldiers left. They just went off in the night. Soon after, the Great Dam opened on its own.</string>
  <string id="19050" soundid="21411">There wasn&apos;t anyone around. The water drained, revealing the old ruins. Underwater these eighteen years, and now they&apos;re back.</string>
  <string id="19051" soundid="21412">I don&apos;t know what made the Great Dam open. Some say it was ghosts. They say those who died in the town don&apos;t want to be forgotten.</string>
  <string id="19053" soundid="21414">We don&apos;t know how. We are simple people, and the Great Dam is not a simple thing. They say there is magic involved in its construction.</string>
  <string id="19055" soundid="21416">Thank you for listening, youngster. Not many do anymore.</string>
  <string id="19056" soundid="21417">I don&apos;t know that you&apos;re wrong. But everyone has to make their own choices. Pray you never have to make some of the choices I have.</string>
  <string id="19060">Villager</string>
  <string id="19062" soundid="21423">Away with you then, youngster. Turn your back on Old Wei.</string>
  <string id="19063" soundid="21424">Well, well. Took care of those pirates, did you? A fine job. If only that dam were closed up. This would be a nice place to live again.</string>
  <string id="19064" soundid="21425">Well, you took care of the dam! Good job, youngster. Never thought I&apos;d be glad to see that dam closed up.</string>
  <string id="19065" soundid="21426">You again? What do you want now?</string>
  <string id="19066" soundid="21427">I may have one foot in the grave, but my mind is still sharp. Pray you can say the same when you&apos;ve seen as many years as I have, youngster!</string>
  <string id="19068" soundid="21429">Yes, youngster, I was. Still remember it like yesterday. This town, Tien&apos;s Landing, used to be where the three plateaus come together down river. It was a fine town.</string>
  <string id="19069" soundid="21430">Let&apos;s see what you have there... oh. </string>
  <string id="19070" soundid="21431">Yes, yes it&apos;s mine. She was my wife, and she didn&apos;t make it out of the rising waters.</string>
  <string id="19071" soundid="21432">I can&apos;t tell you what this means to me. After all these years, there are no words. Thank you. Thank you.</string>
  <string id="19072" soundid="21433">You would hold this hostage? I&apos;m an old man with nothing left but my memories of a better time. Don&apos;t do this.</string>
  <string id="19073" soundid="21434">I... I... very well, I will give you all I have. Take it.</string>
  <string id="19074" soundid="21435">Thank you. You are not a very nice person, but you have brought me comfort anyway.</string>
  <string id="19075" soundid="21436">What... but I... you are a monster! I have seen terrible things in my life, but you are the worst. Your ancestors are weeping with shame.</string>
  <string id="19076" soundid="21437">Eh? What do you want?</string>
  <string id="19077" soundid="21438">I&apos;m Wei. Some call me Old Wei, but that&apos;s because they don&apos;t know Old Chan. If I&apos;m old, he&apos;s ancient. He&apos;s at least a week older than me.</string>
  <string id="19078" soundid="21439">Of course, we&apos;re both pretty old compared to most of the people in Tien&apos;s Landing. Why, most of them don&apos;t even remember what it was like before the flood.</string>
  <string id="19081" soundid="141541">I know you held it until recently, but Kia Min has a knack for group fights, and she set a new bar just yesterday.</string>
  <string id="19087">Surprised you remember me, at your age.</string>
  <string id="19095">What happened?</string>
  <string id="19099">Go on.</string>
  <string id="19102">No one here will talk about the ruins.</string>
  <string id="19104">You never sought revenge for the flooding of your town?</string>
  <string id="19107">I saw the ruins on my way here. They aren&apos;t underwater.</string>
  <string id="19112">Why hasn&apos;t anyone closed the gates?</string>
  <string id="19114">Thank you for telling me your story.</string>
  <string id="19115">You peasants deserve whatever happens to you!</string>
  <string id="19117">Slave</string>
  <string id="19123" soundid="152422">We were talking about Gao earlier, but now isn&apos;t really the time to finish that conversation.</string>
  <string id="19124">Goodbye.</string>
  <string id="19125">Were you here during the flood?</string>
  <string id="19128">I found this portrait in the ruins. Is it yours?</string>
  <string id="19129">Looks familiar?</string>
  <string id="19130">At least you&apos;ll have this to remember her by. Take it.</string>
  <string id="19131">You can have it back for only a bit of silver.</string>
  <string id="19132">Well if you&apos;re going to whine, just take it.</string>
  <string id="19133">You&apos;ll treasure it more if you pay a dear price for it.</string>
  <string id="19134">And here you go. A pleasure doing business with you.</string>
  <string id="19135">Thank you for the silver. I&apos;ve decided to keep the portrait.</string>
  <string id="19136">I was just curious. I&apos;m going to keep it.</string>
  <string id="19137">So is it yours or not? I don&apos;t have all day old man.</string>
  <string id="19138">Who are you?</string>
  <string id="19141">I think I&apos;ve heard enough blather for one lifetime.</string>
  <string id="19154">Tavern Keeper</string>
  <string id="19178">In the traditional stance for the long sword, the wielder keeps their body loose, with the blade held above the head. This allows the swordsman to make long sweeping cuts, keeping his foes off balance. Wielders of the long sword move with a stylized grace, virtually dancing about the battlefield. Their blades shine in the sun as their beautiful attacks cut a deadly swath through their mesmerized foes.</string>

  <string id="19521" soundid="124878">I&apos;m afraid that wouldn&apos;t help, living one. It must be Kindly Yushan himself who does this. Our deaths are on his hands, so he must do the burial.</string>

  <string id="19531" soundid="144607">Well, it&apos;s my life&apos;s work, that&apos;s for sure. And with the way all these spirits have been rising up, it&apos;ll probably be my death&apos;s work, as well. Eh-heheh.</string>
  <string id="19536">You found another piece of the amulet and unlocked two more gem slots.</string>
  <string id="19539" soundid="124879">I... I don&apos;t know where Yushan is now. When the flood came, I prayed he would save us. But he never showed up. Maybe he tried....</string>
  <string id="19541" soundid="124880">Questions? There is little we could tell you, big person. We are trapped here, in the ruins of the orphanage. We can&apos;t leave, and we can&apos;t rest until Kindly Yushan buries our bones.</string>
  <string id="19547" soundid="127099">True, but that can become a convenient excuse. Eventually, you may decide that even direct violence is too inefficient for someone of your strength.</string>
  <string id="19548" soundid="127100">It is a small leap from there to enforcing your will so that the crime never takes place. Suddenly, you are the oppressor, when all you wanted to do was make things right.</string>

  <string id="19550" soundid="127102">It is the &quot;low path,&quot; the way of aggression and discord. A misunderstood path often misused by those who wish to justify a thuggish nature.</string>
  <string id="19551" soundid="127103">It is not as simple as crushing your enemies, or as mindless as terrorizing the weak. It is a mindset born of impatience, of imposing your will.</string>
  <string id="19552" soundid="127104">An evil man might ignore a plea for help because he does not care, but that shows a disconnection with the world. That is not part of the Way.</string>
  <string id="19553" soundid="127105">A man on the &quot;low path&quot; might also ignore that plea, but he would do so because that person should demonstrate they are fit to survive on their own.</string>
  <string id="19554" soundid="127106">The difference is in the details. That same man might help if the odds are unreasonable. He might also do it to incur favor. There is thought in his actions.</string>
  <string id="19556" soundid="126507">You killed her? I didn&apos;t want that! I just wanted her to leave Lan and me alone. This... this is horrible! I&apos;ve known her since we were children!</string>
  <string id="19557" soundid="126508">We grew up together; her family lived right next to mine. What am I going to tell Ai Ling&apos;s mother the next time I see her? I... I can&apos;t believe you killed her.</string>

  <string id="19561" soundid="126512"></string>
  <string id="19567" soundid="126518">I guess I should thank you. I just wish there could have been some other way. I... I should go tell Ai Ling&apos;s family what happened.</string>
  <string id="19568" soundid="126519">Reward? For killing Ai Ling? You&apos;re... you&apos;re a monster! Whatever deal you had with Lan, I want no part of it! Go talk to her for your reward.</string>
  <string id="19569">Ai Ling is dead.</string>
  <string id="19570" soundid="127107">He is not a mindless killer, but he may let strength decide what course is best. That is why it is a dangerous path. It can so easily be misinterpreted.</string>
  <string id="19571" soundid="127108">You are the sum of your actions. The harmony or discord that you sow will weigh on your shoulders as surely as any physical yoke.</string>
  <string id="19572" soundid="127109">But... there can be advantages. Certain forms of attack inherently lean toward one extreme or the other. They have a rhythm that resonates within you.</string>
  <string id="19573" soundid="127110">You may find that some attacks perform better if you are... more intent on causing discord. How you use this is for you to discover and decide.</string>

  <string id="19575" soundid="127112">Master Li is a private man, and I will not presume to speak for him. His interest in you surpasses the care of any master I have known. He must see great potential in you.</string>
  <string id="19577" soundid="127114">I&apos;d rather not. He is impatiently traveling the low path, and I long ago abandoned him to it. He is reckless, and he neither seeks nor wants my guidance.</string>
  <string id="19578" soundid="127115">As young as he is, Gao has impressive skill. Master Li has tried to restrain him, but I know how far he has gone. He weilds powerful energies but has the temper of a child.</string>
  <string id="19579" soundid="127116">You have seen a small part of what Gao conceals. Master Li wisely forbids such displays, but I know how far he has gone. Gao has great skill but the temper of a child.</string>

  <string id="19581" soundid="127118">Master Li has taught the base of such techniques to you and others--mastering chi is important for any student here--but he also demands control.</string>
  <string id="19582" soundid="127119">Gao&apos;s father most likely tutored him. By all that I have heard, both are impatient and spoiled. They can be provoked into... explosive outbursts.</string>
  <string id="19583" soundid="127120">Only what she lets me know. A very private woman, despite spending so long in the school. You probably know her as well as anyone does.</string>

  <string id="22285" soundid="141545">Kia Min says that she is feeling well, and her wound seems to be already healing. I believe she will provide a fine challenge for you.</string>
  <string id="22286" soundid="25565">You near the end of your training, but I am still your master. You have a greater role than you know. For now, do as I say, and keep the basics at heart.</string>
  <string id="22287" soundid="25566">Dawn Star will be near her garden at the entrance to the school. Gujin will be in his shop near the village gate, up the stairs from the village square.</string>
  <string id="22288" soundid="126635">Master Li told me to pass on that you should speak to him when you have the chance. He said you could take your time, so you need not rush.</string>
  <string id="22289" soundid="126636">You have some time to wander the school and talk with other students. Smiling Mountain likely has some of the younger students available if you want to spar.</string>
  <string id="22303">Restless Spirit</string>
  <string id="22304" soundid="142599">Ah, there you are, my student. It is not like you to turn down a friendly match with Jing Woo, but you have exceeded the point where you can learn much from facing him.</string>
  <string id="22318" soundid="141546">Kia Min says that she is feeling well, though I worry about such exertions so soon after a wound. But, she knows her capabilities and would not take a foolish risk.</string>
  <string id="22319" soundid="141547">If you win this match, then I will have a special reward for you. Good fortunes.</string>
  <string id="22320" soundid="141548">I&apos;m afraid that unless Kia Min is feeling well enough to face you, I don&apos;t have enough students to allow you to do anything but tie her record.</string>
  <string id="22321" soundid="141549">There are a few, but not enough for me to set up some of the more challenging matches that I&apos;m sure you would prefer.</string>
  <string id="22322" soundid="141550">With the bandits approaching, most of the students are busy, but if you wish to limber up, I can set up a quick match. I want you at your best when the bandits arrive.</string>
  <string id="22323" soundid="141551">There will be more students available later in the day when many of their exercises have concluded.</string>
  <string id="22326" soundid="25605">Enjoy the words of your fellows. I will wait in the main hall, where we will discuss the Spirit Cave. Be certain you are ready when you come to me; your life is about to change.</string>
  <string id="22327" soundid="25606"></string>
  <string id="22353">What is this place?</string>
  <string id="22354" soundid="142261"></string>
  <string id="22355" soundid="141553"></string>
  <string id="22366" soundid="141554">Well done. As promised, here is a reward for setting a new standard. Kia Min is eager to try again, but I asked her to rest for now. She seems well, despite her earlier injury.</string>
  <string id="22367">I will do as you ask.</string>
  <string id="22369">Is that all? Am I an errand boy? I&apos;m better than that.</string>
  <string id="22370" soundid="141555">You have set a new standard and your prize is well-earned, but forgive me, my attention is elsewhere. Kia Min&apos;s injury has worsened, as you could probably see.</string>
  <string id="22371">Where can I find Dawn Star and Gujin?</string>
  <string id="22372" soundid="126637">You do not need to be so confrontational. This was merely practice. One of the few times where a loss carries no impact.</string>
  <string id="22373" soundid="126638">I didn&apos;t expect to beat you. No doubt you were focused on technique and got distracted.</string>
  <string id="22385" soundid="69718">Your defiance grows tiresome, student of Li. You must learn your place in the order of things.</string>
  <string id="22387" soundid="69719">Fools! Can you not dispose of one defiant peasant?</string>

  <string id="22396" soundid="142604"></string>
  <string id="22398" soundid="141707">Why does it matter? I was born by my mother and sucked at her teat like every man... well, like every man does with *his* mother.</string>
  <string id="22399" soundid="141708">Anyway, by the time I was old enough to swing an axe, my father was dead and my mother disowned me. &apos;Course, killing my father might have given her reason.</string>
  <string id="22400" soundid="141709">I think she did it out of shame. My father beat me and my brother senseless and made our lives miserable. Either way, that was the end of my childhood.</string>
  <string id="22402" soundid="141710">Ha! I wasn&apos;t brave. I was furious... and he was drunk. It was an easy fight.</string>
  <string id="22403" soundid="141711">I&apos;ve done worse since then, believe me.</string>
  <string id="22404" soundid="141712">I traveled a lot after that, begging for some things and taking the rest. Tough times, but not the worst. My axes and my wits kept me alive.</string>
  <string id="22405" soundid="141713">Yeah, yeah. I had some wits before I got them all knocked out of me. Mostly I just used my axes and my fists.</string>
  <string id="22406" soundid="141714">You&apos;d think a seven year old might be an easy target, but I soon learned just where to cut a man to make a him squeal like a pig. Ahh... those were the days.</string>
  <string id="22407" soundid="166923">Then there&apos;s merchant Fen Do. Someday, I&apos;d appreciate it if he&apos;d quit complaining that he hasn&apos;t struck it rich yet. At least he hasn&apos;t struck it elderly, I say.</string>
  <string id="22409" soundid="141557">Gao&apos;s actions were foolish. He knew he could not beat you fairly, and so he chose to catch you by surprise.</string>
  <string id="22410" soundid="141558">I hear bandits have injured Kia Min! She is a favorite pupil, and holds the record for the challenge I run. I&apos;m sure Master Li will take care of her.</string>
  <string id="22411" soundid="189735"></string>
  <string id="22412">Can we talk about Kia Min?</string>
  <string id="22415" soundid="166925">You wish to challenge the one person brave enough to get the dam closed? You&apos;re slower than I thought. No thanks, I don&apos;t need you damaged.</string>
  <string id="22416" soundid="154218">There is a place for the enforcer, the man or woman who brings death to those who have earned or otherwise deserve it. I consider that to be an honest calling.</string>

  <string id="22473" soundid="69720">Very well, I will face you myself! No matter your destiny, you will fall here today!</string>

  <string id="22596">Give it up? What do you mean?</string>
  <string id="22597">Give me some more advice.</string>
  <string id="22600" soundid="136827"></string>
  <string id="22601">Lotus Assassin</string>
  <string id="22604" soundid="26033">Greetingsh and shalutations! Welcome to Mashter Dutong&apos;sh teahoushe! What can I do for you, my friend?</string>
  <string id="22605" soundid="26034">Whadda you want? Come to mock me? Come to laugh at the tragedy that ish the life of Three Sheetsh Dutong?</string>
  <string id="22606" soundid="26035">You! I&apos;ve sheen you around here, shkulking around. Watching me. Why ish you following me? What do you want?</string>
  <string id="22607" soundid="114564">Of course, you are the expert on demons, having faced one in the ring already. I hoped the rumors they would bring such beasts into the ring were false.</string>
  <string id="22615" soundid="116167">I thought one of the sailors trapped here might make a good husband, but they&apos;re just a bunch of drunks!</string>
  <string id="22616" soundid="43354">Hello there, traveler. Forgive my forwardness, but I noticed your arrival earlier while I was at the tavern. That flying machine of yours is truly a marvel.</string>
  <string id="22617" soundid="43355">I actually have a design for a new prototype flyer, and I hope to get funding to build it one day. The other scholars aren&apos;t interested in my inventions, though.</string>
  <string id="22618" soundid="43356">I also collect interesting magical items when I can find them. Some of them I use, and some of them I sell to fund my flyer project.</string>
  <string id="22619" soundid="43357">Me? You want to ask *me* something? Well, sure, I&apos;d be glad to help you if I can. What would you like to know?</string>
  <string id="22620">You cannot unselect a choice from a previous level.</string>
  <string id="22621">You cannot purchase this upgrade until you have bought the one before it.</string>
  <string id="22622" soundid="43360">That&apos;s right, you&apos;re new here, aren&apos;t you? Well, where should I begin? There&apos;s so much to tell you. There are several important areas here in the city.</string>
  <string id="22623" soundid="43361">Of course, there are also many different services, too. Um, I&apos;m not sure what to tell you first.</string>
  <string id="22624" soundid="43362">Sure. Well, let&apos;s see. This place is the Scholars&apos; Garden. For the most part, only stuffy old philosophers and scholars reside here.</string>
  <string id="22626" soundid="43364">You&apos;ll also find the path to the Black Leopard School there, across the river from the arena. I haven&apos;t been there, but I hear it&apos;s an interesting place to visit.</string>
  <string id="22628" soundid="43366">One of the best places in the city is the arena. Just don&apos;t tell my masters I said so. If you go to the arena, you&apos;ll also see the Heart of the Empire Tavern.</string>
  <string id="22629" soundid="43367">I&apos;m not supposed to go there... at least, not when I&apos;m studying. But it&apos;s hard to resist. It&apos;s known as the best tavern in all the Empire.</string>
  <string id="22630" soundid="43368">I actually do some of my best thinking while I&apos;m there. I like to sit in the upper rooms with a bit of wine and just look out over the city... or the arena.</string>
  <string id="22631" soundid="43369">Well, I&apos;ve got some magical items you might find interesting. You can also try Wu Pingbo. I often go to him when I need something. He&apos;s over in the Market District.</string>
  <string id="22632">Switch</string>
  <string id="22633">Switch</string>
  <string id="22634">Yellow switch</string>
  <string id="22635">Green switch</string>
  <string id="22636">Red switch</string>
  <string id="22638" soundid="43371">It&apos;s one of my guilty pleasures, I have to admit. When I was a little boy I used to dream of fighting in the arena. My uncle had other plans, however.</string>
  <string id="22639" soundid="43372">At any rate, watching those fighters compete is one of the most exhilarating experiences. You look as though you could handle yourself in the arena.</string>
  <string id="22640" soundid="43373">Of course. What do you want to know?</string>
  <string id="22641" soundid="43374">Now, there&apos;s a question you don&apos;t hear very often. Not too many people like to talk about him. In fact, if I were you, I&apos;d be careful who I ask.</string>
  <string id="22642" soundid="43375">I&apos;m not one to believe in superstitious nonsense, but I still wouldn&apos;t want to draw his attention. He&apos;s very powerful and very dangerous.</string>
  <string id="22643" soundid="43376">Some people even suggest that he has gained some control over our honorable Emperor. I find it hard to believe, but I suppose it&apos;s possible.</string>
  <string id="22644">This choice is disallowed.</string>
  <string id="22645">This choice is the prerequisite of an existing choice.</string>
  <string id="22646">I&apos;ll leave you to your drinking.</string>
  <string id="22647">Blue switch</string>
  <string id="22648">Shrine</string>
  <string id="22649" soundid="43379">A city like this always has rumors. Some people say the ghosts are angry and attacking innocent people. Another rumor suggests the Emperor is dying.</string>
  <string id="22650" soundid="43380">But I wouldn&apos;t believe any of that. Just because the Emperor hasn&apos;t been seen in a while doesn&apos;t mean he&apos;s ill. Perhaps he just wants some solitude.</string>
  <string id="22651">Shrine</string>
  <string id="22652">Let&apos;s talk about that writ you showed Mother Kwan.</string>
  <string id="22653">Shrine</string>
  <string id="22674" soundid="26103">Hello again, dearie. I hope you&apos;re having a nice time here in my--I mean, in Master Dutong&apos;s--teahouse.</string>
  <string id="22678">Blossom - test version</string>
  <string id="22681">That doesn&apos;t work, does it?</string>
  <string id="22683">Imperial Guard Captain</string>
  <string id="22684">This is going to be painful... for you.</string>
  <string id="22704">I want to ask you some questions.</string>
  <string id="22717" soundid="26146">I&apos;m watching you. Don&apos;t try anything funny.</string>
  <string id="22720" soundid="26149">Dutong says he hired me because I&apos;m big as an ox and just as smart.</string>
  <string id="22721">Three Sheets Dutong</string>
  <string id="22726" soundid="26155">What? Can&apos;t you just leave an old man in peace?</string>
  <string id="22727" soundid="26156">Why do you care? That was a long time ago. Long, long ago. All I want is to forget those days. They&apos;re gone... gone forever.</string>
  <string id="22729" soundid="127122">If you wish, but only introspection reveals true insight. I used to call the trading center of Phoenix Gate my home, but I am settled here. I have nothing to go back to.</string>
  <string id="22730" soundid="26159">A better man might have saved them. Sometimes I wonder... I wonder if I should have died with them. </string>
  <string id="22731" soundid="26160">Your threat holds little power over me. I deserve to suffer... I deserve death. I would have done it myself were I not such a coward. </string>
  <string id="22732" soundid="26161">No! Not the orphanage. The ruins are haunted! The children will be waiting for me. No!</string>
  <string id="22733" soundid="26162">You&apos;re right. I can carry this burden no longer. I must face the demons of my past and end this, one way or another. I will go with you and accept whatever fate awaits me.</string>
  <string id="22734" soundid="26163">Yes... do it! I only ask that you make it quick.</string>
  <string id="22735" soundid="26164">Sorry doesn&apos;t count for much. Sorry can&apos;t erase our mistakes. Sorry can&apos;t change the past.</string>
  <string id="22736">You used to be the orphan-master before the flood?</string>
  <string id="22737">I&apos;m taking you to the orphanage... now!</string>
  <string id="22738">What happened the day of the flood?</string>
  <string id="22741">Time to end your miserable life!</string>
  <string id="22743">If you want redemption, meet me at the orphanage.</string>
  <string id="22744">You carry them with you anyway. Now you can free yourself.</string>
  <string id="22745">You can come willingly, or I can drag you. Your choice.</string>
  <string id="22746">Then I will give you the death you deserve!</string>
  <string id="22747">I&apos;m sorry.</string>
  <string id="22748" soundid="26177">Bring me Kindly Yushan&apos;s head. If you won&apos;t do that, then go away and leave me alone.</string>
  <string id="22750" soundid="26179">You... you live? All this time, you were here. I left you to this... I&apos;m sorry. Please forgive me!</string>
  <string id="22752" soundid="26181">No, Miao. Yushan was not brought here so you could make him suffer. He must bury our bones. Then we can finally rest. </string>
  <string id="22755" soundid="26184">Yes... it&apos;s time for this to end. I... I want you to know I&apos;m sorry, Bin. I&apos;m sorry for what happened to you. I&apos;m sorry for what I did....</string>
  <string id="22758" soundid="26187">Goodbye, living one. Goodbye, forever.</string>
  <string id="22760" soundid="26189">I am so sorry...</string>
  <string id="22762">Killer Wenya</string>
  <string id="22766">Poisoned</string>
  <string id="22770">Petrified</string>
  <string id="22771">Afraid</string>
  <string id="22772">Sorry, Bin. I&apos;m letting Miao have her revenge.</string>
  <string id="22774">Howling Haulun</string>
  <string id="22777">Do as Bin says, Yushan. Bury these bones.</string>
  <string id="22783" soundid="125467">Wait! This man is just a poor peasant. Show some compassion. At least hear what he has to say!</string>
  <string id="22784">Fleeing</string>
  <string id="22785">Old Mother Kwan</string>
  <string id="22850" soundid="135860">This forest is full of ghosts, and they grow bolder by the day. They have never appeared in this campsite before, but now I find you under attack here.</string>
  <string id="22879" soundid="141785">You have no right to talk, vermin.</string>
  <string id="22880" soundid="141786">And here is one more to kill for Gao. What fun.</string>
  <string id="22882">Slaver</string>
  <string id="22883" soundid="26319">You are an orphan, but you were not abandoned. You were rescued from the temple of Dirge, in the Land of Howling Spirits. You were orphaned by violent action.</string>
  <string id="22884">Thank you for the bout.</string>
  <string id="22886">Sagacious Zu</string>
  <string id="22887" soundid="26323">I take responsibility for it. You see, I used to be more than a humble teacher. To learn of yourself, you must learn more of me. I was once leader of the Imperial Army.</string>
  <string id="22888">Each bruise is a mark of your failure to learn our Master&apos;s teachings.</string>
  <string id="22890">Such things happen.</string>
  <string id="22891">Enjoy it. It won&apos;t happen again.</string>
  <string id="22894" soundid="26330">I am sorry, but I wanted your development unspoiled by expectation, and with the events of late... well, there have been many factors acting upon you.</string>
  <string id="22898" soundid="131758"></string>
  <string id="22899" soundid="68527">I almost forgot! The director asked me to give you this. He was very pleased with how you worked the new revisions into the play so naturally.</string>
  <string id="22904" soundid="26340">I will tell you more, but first, we have an uninvited visitor.</string>
  <string id="22905" soundid="26341"></string>
  <string id="22906" soundid="26342"></string>
  <string id="22907" soundid="26343"></string>
  <string id="22908" soundid="26344">Gao never could keep his ears to himself, especially when angry. So predictable. He&apos;s heard as much as I wanted him to. Perhaps it will give him a little perspective.</string>
  <string id="22909" soundid="26345">He should respect even the most humble person, because who knows what lies within? That includes you and me both.</string>
  <string id="22913" soundid="26349">I withdrew my support, and tried to rally your people against the siege I had helped plan. A doomed effort. Many died on both sides. Sun Kin, another brother, also fell.</string>
  <string id="22914" soundid="26350">Your people were killed. I am haunted by it, and now the world may join me. The assassin on the beach was a Lotus Assassin, a minion of Death&apos;s Hand. More will come.</string>
  <string id="22915" soundid="26351">Most in the Empire know nothing of the Land of Howling Spirits. I found its people to be honorable, but I can&apos;t tell you more than that. There was no time to learn more.</string>
  <string id="22917" soundid="26353">You were meant for something important, but because of my actions it was denied you. Stories about ghosts... the assassin on the beach. You are tied to this.</string>
  <string id="22920" soundid="26356">The Spirit Cave will make things as clear as they can be. Only you are meant to understand what is within. You will see the corruption of the spirit realm for yourself.</string>
  <string id="22924" soundid="26360">No, but few places truly are. This has been a lot to comprehend, so take your time. There are instructions inside, and something that belongs to you. An amulet.</string>
  <string id="22925" soundid="26361">When you emerge you will know more about yourself and your destiny than I can explain. And you will better know your enemy.</string>
  <string id="22927" soundid="26363"></string>
  <string id="22928" soundid="26364"></string>
  <string id="22929" soundid="26365">It was partly the strange skills of Dawn Star that showed me to the corruption, and partly something that belongs to you. You&apos;ll understand when you enter.</string>
  <string id="22930" soundid="26366">Er, well, it is thought that spirits naturally try to find their way to the underworld, but if their lives or deaths were painful, they return to what was familiar.</string>
  <string id="22931" soundid="26367">The school has seen its share of tragedy in the past. Something of yours has allowed me to keep the students protected, but the dead will be everywhere soon enough.</string>
  <string id="22932" soundid="26368">You must enter and see for yourself.</string>
  <string id="22933" soundid="26369">Good. Focus on that. It will... keep your head clear. I know you are up to this task. There are instructions inside, and something that belongs to you. An amulet.</string>
  <string id="22934" soundid="26370">He is the right hand of the Emperor, and rules the Lotus Assassins in place of Prince Sun Kin who was killed at Dirge, a death he may have orchestrated.</string>
  <string id="22935" soundid="26371">He shows no hesitation, and gave no thought to the lives of those we faced. His influence poisons the Emperor. I have no doubt he is utterly evil.</string>
  <string id="22936" soundid="156563">I know you. You are servants of the Water Dragon, who once ruled Dirge. But your mistress has no power here now.</string>
  <string id="22937" soundid="26373">There were three: Emperor Sun Hai; Prince Sun Kin the Hand of Heaven; and myself, Sun Li the Glorious Strategist. Age decided our place in the order of things.</string>

  <string id="22949" soundid="26385">A vision? Ah... of course you did. A natural reaction to the great amount of information I have placed before you. It may have something to do with your amulet.</string>
  <string id="22950" soundid="26386">Er... tell me, did you learn anything about the destiny that stretches before you? Or what has led you this far?</string>
  <string id="22951" soundid="26387">A spirit released you? That explains your strange exit. This is a very sudden development I did not foresee. Perhaps it has something to do with your amulet.</string>

  <string id="22957" soundid="26393">What? What is it, Woo? I&apos;m sorry, my mind was elsewhere.</string>
  <string id="22958" soundid="26394">Dawn Star, as I told you, Master. She went missing after Gao&apos;s men were discovered in the school. The state of her room suggests some sort of fight took place.</string>
  <string id="22959" soundid="26395">I see. She is not there?</string>
  <string id="22960" soundid="26396">No, Master Li. There is no sign of her.</string>

  <string id="22963" soundid="26399">Your appearance put Gao&apos;s disgrace out of my mind, but it would seem that your... early exit from the caves has come at just the right time.</string>
  <string id="22964" soundid="26400">I doubt she has come to harm. She is a strong woman, as you know. That doesn&apos;t mean you shouldn&apos;t search for her. It will be a good measure of your ability.</string>
  <string id="22965" soundid="26401">I didn&apos;t mean to appear callous. I&apos;m sure Dawn Star is fine. What I meant was that this will serve as a final measure of your abilities.</string>

  <string id="22967" soundid="26403">Seek her out. I doubt she is in the school, and someone would have seen her if she was in the village. You might want to try the surrounding marshland. </string>
  <string id="22968" soundid="26404">That is good. Time is very important. Here, take some silver. I asked Fen Do and the others to stock essence gems in preparation for this day. Hopefully, they have done so.</string>

  <string id="23024">Master! You&apos;ve never said anything about this!</string>
  <string id="23032">Why hide that you are the Emperor&apos;s brother?</string>
  <string id="23035">Can you tell me anything about my people?</string>

  <string id="23055">Who is this &quot;Death&apos;s Hand?&quot;</string>

  <string id="23076">She said I was the last Spirit Monk. What does that mean?</string>
  <string id="23077">I didn&apos;t need that long. A spirit released me.</string>
  <string id="23090">Dawn Star is missing? Where would she go?</string>
  <string id="23092">What did you mean when you said this will be useful?</string>
  <string id="23095">I will start right away.</string>
  <string id="23096">I have more questions about what I have seen.</string>

  <string id="23134">Yes, let&apos;s begin.</string>

  <string id="23143" soundid="109213">Finally, Master Radiant is out of the way. Now Master Smiling Hawk can make our school strong again.</string>
  <string id="23145" soundid="109214">Master Smiling Hawk said you aren&apos;t a member of the school anymore. I&apos;m not allowed to fight with you.</string>

  <string id="23147" soundid="154590">Thank you so much. I was at my wit&apos;s end. You&apos;ve done me a great service today.</string>

  <string id="23151" soundid="109218">That&apos;s fine with me. The more I fight you, the closer I come to figuring out your technique.</string>
  <string id="23152" soundid="109219">You again. I&apos;ll fight you again if you want, but maybe you should try Fifth Brother next... if you haven&apos;t already. It&apos;s up to you.</string>
  <string id="23153" soundid="109220">Hello again. Come to regain your pride? Don&apos;t worry, I&apos;ve beaten most of the students here. I&apos;ll give you another chance, if you like.</string>
  <string id="23154" soundid="109221">Are you interested in fighting, or did you just come here to talk?</string>
  <string id="23155">I&apos;m always ready to fight!</string>
  <string id="23157" soundid="109223">So you&apos;re the one who was challenging our novices earlier. That might impress Master Radiant, but it won&apos;t get you noticed by Master Smiling Hawk.</string>
  <string id="23158" soundid="109224">I&apos;m Sixth Brother Gaoshan. If you think you can defeat a disciple of Master Smiling Hawk, challenge *me*. I assure you, I&apos;m much tougher than the novices.</string>
  <string id="23168" soundid="109225">All right, follow me.</string>
  <string id="23173" soundid="151646">You will be well rewarded... if you succeed. Go now... Third Brother has agreed to withdraw from his fight with you. You can deal directly with First Brother.</string>
  <string id="23177" soundid="51567">Master Li keeps talking about restless dead, but there&apos;s nothing like that around here.</string>
  <string id="23178" soundid="51568">Gao refuses to practice with the rest of us. He thinks he&apos;s too good for us.</string>
  <string id="23180" soundid="109232">Ha! So you&apos;d rather talk than fight. It&apos;s students like you that are giving the Black Leopard School a bad name.</string>
  <string id="23188" soundid="154592">Zhong coming. Zhong go home now.</string>
  <string id="23190">I&apos;d like to spar with you.</string>
  <string id="23191" soundid="144609">At the center of it all is the Emperor&apos;s Tomb. A monstrosity, I tell you. Completely unnecessary, but the Emperor&apos;s word is law. And they never even finished the thing.</string>

  <string id="23338" soundid="127127">It is not important. Suffice to say that I prefer this little village to the temptations of a greater city. Enough about me. What else can I do for you?</string>
  <string id="23341" soundid="145343">Gao was in a rush, but you might be able to catch him still.</string>

  <string id="23813" soundid="152326">The drunks clogging up the streets aren&apos;t pirates. They&apos;re only traveling merchants, sailors who were trapped here when the dam was opened.</string>
  <string id="23814" soundid="152327">Minister Sheng finds them to be an annoyance, but not a concern worth worrying about. If the dam is closed they will simply disappear. Not like Gao and his pirates.</string>
  <string id="23815" soundid="152328">Yes, I believe that was his name. Gao. An unsavory character by all accounts. There are even rumors he is connected to that infamous crime syndicate known as the Guild.</string>
  <string id="23816" soundid="152329">The pirates have been operating in this area for many years, or so I was told. However, things became much more serious when Gao took over.</string>
  <string id="23838" soundid="27800">You dare disturb me in my grief? I said, no interruptions! You will pay for... wait. You are not one of my servants. I know you.</string>
  <string id="23839" soundid="165645">That is the way of things here. Take care of yourself first. Risks bear penalties as well as rewards.</string>
  <string id="23840">Why didn&apos;t you help me fight Shin&apos;s Attendants?</string>
  <string id="23841" soundid="191421"></string>
  <string id="23843" soundid="43931">It will be a simple matter. Five judges, six topics. I&apos;ll pose my argument about why your foolish land stumbles like a child, and you try to answer.</string>
  <string id="23844" soundid="43932">The judges will raise their arms to indicate whom they favor. Arms up for you, arms down for me. After six topics, if you have a majority, you are the winner.</string>
  <string id="23845" soundid="43933">By the Queen&apos;s corset, if you get them all on your side at any time, I&apos;ll declare the match over. Now, shall we proceed?</string>
  <string id="23847" soundid="43935">I will pull no punches, and I expect no mercy on your part. Let us see which of us is truly superior.</string>
  <string id="23848" soundid="27794">You have gone quite far enough. I am Inquisitor Lim, an elite of the Lotus Assassins.</string>
  <string id="23851" soundid="66276">I simply fill a need the best way I can. What is the crime in that? Now, if you&apos;re looking for a little extra coin, I really need some help.</string>
  <string id="23852" soundid="66277">Someone who knows how to keep their mouth shut and recognizes a good deal. Someone who likes silver... lots of silver. Does this sound like you?</string>
  <string id="23854" soundid="110013">You do not face Emperor Sun Li. You face the whole of the Imperial Army. All of it. Not lone Assassins or a single brigade, but the whole of the army, golems and all!</string>
  <string id="23855">Map to D-pad</string>
  <string id="23856" soundid="165563">It&apos;s funny what things you can learn if you just ask at the right time, like when you have a knife to someone&apos;s throat.</string>
  <string id="23857" soundid="66217">The door at the top of this stair is locked through a fairly ingenious mechanism. Gao&apos;s engineer, Kang the Mad, designed it for security.</string>
  <string id="23858" soundid="66218">Kang the Mad is a crafty fellow. The door requires two to unlock it. Up high there is a platform with the release lever.</string>
  <string id="23859" soundid="66219">The door must be operated while that lever is held forward. There used to be a sentry up there who handled that kind of thing, but he had an... accident.</string>
  <string id="23860" soundid="66220">Once the door is open, we can go our separate ways. I have my goals, and I&apos;m sure you have yours. Since we both have much to do, why don&apos;t I go unlock the door now?</string>
  <string id="23861">One of the people hit hardest by the opening of the dam is Captain Ing. The river is too low and fast for his ship, so he is trapped in Tien&apos;s Landing with no way to earn his livelihood, and his men are becoming mutinous. If you close the dam, he will reward you with silver, although he has little to spare.</string>
  <string id="23862">Trapped</string>
  <string id="23871">Lost Spirit</string>
  <string id="24039" soundid="152330">The pirates started using flyers and gathering slaves at an enormous rate. I imagine things are very unpleasant over at their camp... not that I&apos;m willing to go take a look!</string>
  <string id="24040" soundid="152331">Are you accusing Minister Sheng of neglecting this problem? It&apos;s not that easy. One can&apos;t simply point and say &quot;the pirates are over there&quot;! Well, actually one can.</string>
  <string id="24041" soundid="152332">But the only approach is by river, and no sane bargeman would be willing to risk such a journey. Sane people don&apos;t go looking for the pirates, they avoid them.</string>
  <string id="24043" soundid="152333">I suppose Ru the Boatswain is mad enough to take you, if he&apos;s drunk. Hmmm... yes. Ru is surely the only one who would make the trip. And then the pirates would kill you.</string>
  <string id="24044" soundid="152334">Oh, yes! Let&apos;s! Nothing would please Minister Sheng more.</string>
  <string id="24045">I&apos;ve heard there are pirates around.</string>
  <string id="24046">What can you tell me about these pirates?</string>
  <string id="24047">What do you know about pirates in the area?</string>
  <string id="24049" soundid="66198">Damn you and that school! My Gao was never good enough for Master Li; you were always his prize pupil. And now my son is....</string>
  <string id="24050" soundid="66199">Gao may be gone, but I will avenge him! I know the styles your broken old master taught you, and I know how to beat them! I promise your death will be both slow and painful!</string>
  <string id="24051" soundid="66200"></string>
  <string id="24053" soundid="128706">A reasonable punishment. Gao has some things right.</string>
  <string id="24058" soundid="109403">Good job with those ruffians! Those bandits weren&apos;t gentle with this town. I&apos;m going to help out with some of the repairs.</string>
  <string id="24059">Black Leopard Training Results</string>
  <string id="24060">Student</string>
  <string id="24068" soundid="28026">Are you sure she isn&apos;t off by herself somewhere? She&apos;s always been so moody. I&apos;m sorry, but I haven&apos;t heard or seen anything odd.</string>
  <string id="24069" soundid="28027">Everyone&apos;s here except Gao, and he has no place here any more. He seemed to be in a hurry as he was packing,though.</string>
  <string id="24070" soundid="28028">As I said, I did hear Gao muttering threats under his breath after he was removed from the school, but surely that&apos;s nothing.</string>
  <string id="24071" soundid="28029">I have no idea. If her garden or room is disturbed as Jing Woo said, maybe she chased the person who did it. I don&apos;t know why she didn&apos;t call an alarm, though.</string>
  <string id="24072" soundid="28030">The gate at the center of the village is the only way out. Sometimes boats pass by, but this isn&apos;t the season for them.</string>
  <string id="24073" soundid="28031">If you wish. What do you want to ask about?</string>
  <string id="24074" soundid="28032">Why would you ask me? Everyone knows I don&apos;t get along with her.</string>
  <string id="24075" soundid="28033">She&apos;s too moody to talk to. Always looking past you, as if there&apos;s something more interesting happening behind you.</string>
  <string id="24076" soundid="28034">You certainly don&apos;t seem to have any trouble getting along with her. And you, of all people, should know to look for her at her garden by the school gate.</string>
  <string id="24077" soundid="28035">I suppose she will be at her garden by the school gate. You could look for her there.</string>
  <string id="24078" soundid="28036">As I said, I&apos;m not really the person to ask, but she is probably near her garden by the school gate.</string>
  <string id="24079" soundid="28037">You think I will talk about them behind their backs? I will, but I don&apos;t want people to think of me as the local gossip, even if I am just that.</string>
  <string id="24080" soundid="28038">Of note? There is only one student &quot;of note,&quot; and that would be you. Everyone else, even Dawn Star, is just a background for you and your supposed destiny.</string>
  <string id="24081" soundid="28039">Not that you don&apos;t deserve the attention. I&apos;d be flirting with you non-stop if you weren&apos;t so focused on whatever it is Master Li has in store for you.</string>
  <string id="24082" soundid="28040">All of us get a little envious of that. Even Gao gets pushed aside, and he doesn&apos;t like being anything less than the center of attention.</string>
  <string id="24083" soundid="28041">I&apos;m sure you know that your implied status causes jealous remarks. I have muttered a few, but I don&apos;t mean you harm.</string>
  <string id="24084" soundid="28042">The one you should be careful of is Gao, but I&apos;m not telling you anything you don&apos;t already know.</string>
  <string id="24085" soundid="28043">You know him as well as I do. A rich man&apos;s son. He&apos;s attractive, I suppose, but arrogance follows him like a cloud of locusts.</string>
  <string id="24086" soundid="28044">I hear his father is the same way. Gao the Greater and Gao the Lesser; not a family I would want to be a part of.</string>
  <string id="24087" soundid="160181">You and Dawn Star have both had a lifetime of training under Master Li. He is stern with you, but you sure can see that he&apos;s proud as well.</string>
  <string id="24089" soundid="28047">I&apos;m sorry. I shouldn&apos;t be like that. Dawn Star is a fine person. She just... sees things that I can&apos;t.</string>
  <string id="24090" soundid="28048">I know there are ghosts and spirits, but why should she be able to &quot;sense&quot; them when I can&apos;t? What makes her special?</string>
  <string id="24092" soundid="28050">I&apos;ve already said enough. You can talk to her about what she sees.</string>
  <string id="24093" soundid="28051">Maybe that&apos;s why you two get along so well. Maybe her &quot;sense&quot; for ghosts and the like meshes well with the great destiny Master Li sees for you?</string>
  <string id="24094" soundid="28052">As I said, you&apos;ve known her forever and you&apos;re very close. Her &quot;sense&quot; for ghosts and the like obviously meshes well with whatever destiny Master Li sees for you.</string>
  <string id="24095" soundid="28053">You know what is said. Master Li believes you are special but won&apos;t say why. It makes you... interesting.</string>
  <string id="24096" soundid="28054">Some of the others don&apos;t find it as intriguing as I do. Some even consider it an attack on their worth.</string>
  <string id="24097" soundid="28055">Gao, obviously. You know he doesn&apos;t like you. He never has. And when Master Li tells him to model himself after you, that just makes it worse.</string>
  <string id="24098" soundid="28056">Master Li never stops talking about you. You are special, or so we are repeatedly told. It can get annoying. Then again, some find it outright threatening.</string>
  <string id="24099" soundid="28057">Quite a bit, as I said. Master Li considers you special, and that causes rivalries. I doubt there&apos;s much you can do about it.</string>
  <string id="24100" soundid="28058">Master Li took me in when no one else would. He is a firm master but a kind man deep inside.</string>
  <string id="24101" soundid="28059">I imagine that he walked. If you want anything more than that you&apos;ll have to ask someone who was here at the time. That was twenty years ago.</string>
  <string id="24102" soundid="28060">I really don&apos;t know or care. It may as well have been Sagacious Tien, the first Emperor. That was before I was born.</string>
  <string id="24103" soundid="28061">The Emperor&apos;s brother? I thought both of his brothers died twenty years ago. Master Li says a lot of odd things. You probably just misheard him.</string>
  <string id="24104" soundid="28062">Yes, you said that already. It&apos;s not getting any more believable.</string>
  <string id="24105" soundid="28063">Other than what Dawn Star &quot;senses,&quot; all I have is stories, but they&apos;re becoming more and more common.</string>
  <string id="24109" soundid="28067">We could, if you wish, but it&apos;s much more fun to talk about others. Oh, I&apos;m kidding. Of course we can talk a bit.</string>
  <string id="24110" soundid="28068">I wasn&apos;t the delicate flower my family had hoped for. They believed school would calm my spirit.</string>
  <string id="24111" soundid="28069">But Master Li has shown me how to focus myself. I have learned many skills while here, and not many of them require that I be &quot;delicate.&quot;</string>
  <string id="24112" soundid="28070">When I am done? I... haven&apos;t really thought about it. I won&apos;t go home; there&apos;s no place for me there.</string>
  <string id="24113" soundid="28071">If I can stomach the books, I could become a scholar. Perhaps I will go to the Imperial City. I should see it at least once in my life.</string>
  <string id="24115" soundid="28073">Again? I had no idea you were so interested. You usually spend far more time with that Dawn Star than you do talking with me.</string>
  <string id="24116" soundid="28074">Stay well. After all, how could we learn without our most senior student to guide us.</string>
  <string id="24118" soundid="28076">Perhaps I will see you later. Perhaps not.</string>
  <string id="24119" soundid="28077">Goodbye. I hope you find Dawn Star. She was always... nice.</string>
  <string id="24139">How did Master Li come here?</string>
  <string id="24140">Who was master before Master Li?</string>
  <string id="24141">Master Li told me he was the Emperor&apos;s brother.</string>
  <string id="24142">Tell me what you&apos;ve been hearing about ghosts.</string>
  <string id="24146">I don&apos;t think we&apos;ve ever talked about you, Lin.</string>
  <string id="24147">How did you come here? Why?</string>
  <string id="24149">What will you do when you are done training here?</string>
  <string id="24152">Goodbye for now.</string>
  <string id="24159" soundid="142072">You should show proper respect. Ming is an honored man in this village.</string>
  <string id="24160" soundid="142073">Wait, is that how it goes? Damn, I must be getting old if I&apos;m mixing my sayings like that. Bah, forget it.</string>
  <string id="24161">I want to ask about Dawn Star&apos;s disappearance.</string>
  <string id="24162">Are any other students missing?</string>
  <string id="24163">Have you any clue where Dawn Star would go?</string>

  <string id="24165">Let&apos;s go back to my other questions.</string>
  <string id="24166">Have you seen Dawn Star?</string>
  <string id="24169">You know everyone around here. Is there any news?</string>
  <string id="24170">Who are the students of note?</string>
  <string id="24174">Tell me about Gao.</string>
  <string id="24176">Tell me about Dawn Star.</string>
  <string id="24177" soundid="160183">She also came here very young, didn&apos;t she? The two of you are generally considered the most advanced students here.</string>
  <string id="24178">What are you getting at?</string>
  <string id="24181">What have you heard about me?</string>
  <string id="24183">Who should I be concerned about?</string>
  <string id="24184">What do you think of Master Li?</string>
  <string id="24251">Confused</string>
  <string id="24277" soundid="49290">Ah... well, that is a delicate issue. The recruiter is not so easy to find. I&apos;m sorry, but I can&apos;t tell you much more than that.</string>

Removes negative effects (such as slow or paralysis)
Drains Chi 

Powerful warriors can gain the power to take the form of the fearsome horse demon. This transformation grants the horse demon&apos;s legendary ferocity, as well as its mastery of the element of fire and its immunity to the effects of Support styles. Faced with the immolating brutality of the horse demon, weak-willed foes cower in fear, helpless against the raging flames.

  <string id="24413">Support Style 
Does direct damage in Chi Strike mode
This style&apos;s Area Attack can initiate a Harmonic Combo that produces a Focus power-up.

The forms and strikes of Storm Dragon enable the master to call upon the power of lightning to damage an opponent. While this style&apos;s attacks don&apos;t cause any direct damage, its motions summon forth electricity to course through its victim, doing small but constant damage over time. Storm Dragon will rarely win a fight on its own, but combined with other styles it can easily change the tide of a difficult battle.</string>

  <string id="24554" soundid="31833">Well, then. It seems my brother, and the fates, would encourage you to participate in the arena. You should speak with Qui the Promoter. Until you prove yourself, leave us be.</string>
  <string id="24555" soundid="31834">While my brother Sui may consider you an object of portentous fascination, I do not waste time on spectators.</string>
  <string id="24556" soundid="32829">The Emperor&apos;s tomb is ablaze, and the Lotus Assassins are looking for the person who caused it.</string>
  <string id="24562">Phoenix Assassin</string>
  <string id="24568">Phoenix Assassin</string>
  <string id="24576">Phoenix Assassin</string>
  <string id="24593" soundid="70023">If you&apos;d like more information about the Black Leopard School, speak with First Brother Kai.</string>
  <string id="24596" soundid="160770">I have no idea, though he was very vocal in condeming Master Smiling Hawk. Perhaps he grew tired of all the bickering here and decided to leave.</string>
  <string id="24599" soundid="160771">I know if I was a follower of Master Radiant I would likely get very bored, very quickly. Maybe he just decided to go to a new school, somewhere more peaceful.</string>
  <string id="24601" soundid="28572">Greetings. I am Crimson Khana, known in the Prosperous East for my swordsmanship. I came here to test my abilities but have found my will and purity of spirit tested as well.</string>
  <string id="24606" soundid="105595">The Ravager will not waste time with one so new to the ring! One must face the test of time to even *challenge* the Imperial Champion!</string>
  <string id="24609" soundid="28580">You will start to see the truth of this &quot;contest&quot; as you make your way through the Bronze round. Let your conscience guide you; that is all the advice I can offer.</string>
  <string id="24610" soundid="28581">You are just starting your career here. You will see what I&apos;m talking about soon enough, I&apos;m sure. You do not have the stance of a novice about you.</string>
  <string id="24611" soundid="28582">Forgive me. I should not speak so to a spectator. If you have questions, you should speak with Qui the Promoter.</string>
  <string id="24614" soundid="105596"></string>
  <string id="24615" soundid="31227">Others say the arena recruits for the Lotus Assassins, and it is a theory worth considering. Does my blade somehow aid these Assassins that threaten my homeland? I pray not.</string>
  <string id="24618" soundid="158314">No! Leave Zhong alone, or Zhong get angry and smash things.</string>
  <string id="24619">I demeaned the whole contest. The insult he percieved will unsettle him in combat.</string>
  <string id="24620" soundid="28591">You were drawn here because you have the eyes of a warrior. You see the wave break and the eagle soar. Speak with Qui the Promoter if you wish to compete here.</string>
  <string id="24622" soundid="28593">Your name is on the roster, yet your blade has yet to sing! My master would always say: &quot;Speak with your actions, not words!&quot; Of course, there is more to life than conflict...</string>
  <string id="24624" soundid="188151">There are some old tomes in the temple itself, in a stand near the right wall. You might be able to learn more by poring through them.</string>
  <string id="24625" soundid="28596">Well done. You learn very quickly. One thing bothers me about your moves, though. Throughout the fight I felt as if there was some opening in your defense.</string>
  <string id="24626" soundid="28597"></string>
  <string id="24627" soundid="28598">That beast barely knows why it fights; your purpose fills each strike in a way it could never understand.</string>
  <string id="24628" soundid="28599">Han lacks the competitive drive to progress beyond his current position, but he is skillful enough. Be honored by your victory.</string>
  <string id="24631" soundid="28602">Watching you fight is akin to reading fine poetry. I&apos;m sure you will meet Han in the ring soon enough.</string>
  <string id="24632" soundid="28603">Our blades are drawn to each other as a lodestone sings to steel. They will cross before long, I think.</string>
  <string id="24633" soundid="70026">First Brother Kai is a great leader. Without him, this school would not survive long.</string>
  <string id="24635" soundid="28606">Remember that there is dishonor only in not learning from your loss.</string>
  <string id="24636" soundid="28607">We met and I proved the stronger. There is no shame in this for you. In fact, I would welcome the chance to test myself against you once more.</string>
  <string id="24637" soundid="28608">Do not let this discourage you. You are simply learning the ways of this place. The Imperial Arena is not like the smaller contests in the villages.</string>
  <string id="24638" soundid="28609">Just remember to focus. The qualifying round is stocked with amateurs who know little of true combat.</string>
  <string id="24639" soundid="28610">Your opponents in the Bronze Division are more determined and more skilled than those you faced before. Remember your defense.</string>
  <string id="24641" soundid="188152">All right. Summer and winter seem to be the key. Black Whirlwind will stay behind to offer whatever help he can. If anyone can control him, it&apos;s you.</string>
  <string id="24642" soundid="28613">As the hunter does not waste words on the animals, so will I not spend my breath on you.</string>
  <string id="24643" soundid="28614">I greet you, one warrior to another.</string>
  <string id="24644">I need to know more about the ritual before you leave.</string>
  <string id="24645" soundid="28616">The Assassins recruit from this arena but I would steer clear of them. Their recruiters approached Iron Soldier so perhaps they look only to those at his level.</string>
  <string id="24649" soundid="151536">I recall your earliest lessons. You fell from a thousand feet during the Walk of Death--which alone was odd enough at your age, but you made short work of the Walk of Maiming and the Walk of Intense Discomfort--and tore your head clean off.  I comforted you--well, your head--saying that you could just walk it off, because, you know, the cut was *clean,* and then you would punch a mountain. In space!</string>
  <string id="24653" soundid="151540">I&apos;m a little busy right now. I&apos;ve got a bowl of wine that needs drinking, so why don&apos;t you just find someone else to bother?</string>
  <string id="24654" soundid="151541">[Failure] I know the value of my life... and that&apos;s not nearly enough.</string>
  <string id="24655">Can I ask you some questions before you go?</string>
  <string id="24656" soundid="151543">You&apos;re wasting my time. I wouldn&apos;t give you the time of day for that small amount of silver.</string>
  <string id="24657" soundid="151544">The conversation around here is starting to bother me... I think I&apos;ll take my wine somewhere else.</string>
  <string id="24659" soundid="28630">He is the real power behind Qui, Lucky Cho, and all the rest. He bends the fighters to his will but I will not be his puppet. The Serpent will *never* guide my sword.</string>
  <string id="24661" soundid="45853">Fair enough, though I hope you will attempt to mind your tone in the future.</string>
  <string id="24662" soundid="28633">Kai Lan&apos;s thugs are but a portion of the larger Guild, fixing fights and adjusting the odds in their favor. There are rumors of extortion and worse but it&apos;s best not to speak of it.</string>
  <string id="24664" soundid="28635">Dishonor exists everywhere. The Guild exists in an uneasy truce with the officials, and a steady stream of bribes aids the relationship, from what I hear.</string>
  <string id="24665" soundid="45854">No time spent in study of the ancient ways is lost.</string>
  <string id="24666" soundid="28637">Good. It is a sensitive subject, particularly in this place.</string>
  <string id="24667" soundid="28638">Your eyes tell me that you have already seen much in the way of battle. Ask what you will; I welcome another worthy challenger among the ranks.</string>
  <string id="24668" soundid="28639">With its three divisions, this is the Empire&apos;s largest tournament. Some, like me, come for the challenge; others, like Raging Ox, come for the coin.</string>
  <string id="24670" soundid="28641">Qui the Promoter points the way in this place. Be warned, though; he does not always see the path before he sets you upon it.</string>
  <string id="24671" soundid="28642">Smaller tournaments are simply practice. This is the only arena that truly matters. Don&apos;t worry, though. The early rounds are still filled with graceless rabble.</string>
  <string id="24672" soundid="28643">Of course. What do you need?</string>
  <string id="24673" soundid="28644">There are countless hopefuls, but only a few who are worth really watching. In time, you may find that others are asking about you, as well.</string>
  <string id="24674" soundid="28645">At this point in your career, the higher ranking fighters will tell you about themselves. Still, you must see a thing from many angles to truly know it.</string>
  <string id="24675" soundid="28646">I can tell you about myself, of course, and I know Hapless Han relatively well. I could also tell you something of the beasts they have here.</string>
  <string id="24676" soundid="28647">I am from Phoenix Gate, the largest city in the Prosperous East. There I developed my own techniques of weapon combat. I have vowed to teach them to anyone who can best me.</string>
  <string id="24678" soundid="28649">Han&apos;s... intriguing. While his skill is small, he shows no envy and learns from every encounter. I wonder if he stays in the qualifiers so he can face *every* new fighter.</string>
  <string id="24680" soundid="28651">A number of different creatures are used here to add to the spectacle. Ogres are commonplace, but more recently some sort of sub-human creature has been appearing in the ring.</string>
  <string id="24681" soundid="28652">I&apos;ve heard rumors, though, that the arena organizers are planning on bringing demons into the ring, somehow. I suppose we&apos;ll see in time if there&apos;s any truth to that.</string>
  <string id="24682" soundid="28653">Of course. What did you want to know?</string>
  <string id="24683" soundid="28654">I have not been here as long as some of the others, but I will answer as well as I can. Do you want to know about this area, the Scholars&apos; Garden, or the city in general?</string>
  <string id="24684" soundid="28655">As I&apos;m sure you know, this is the capital of the Jade Empire. The city itself is built around the Emperor&apos;s Gate, the massive passage into the Emperor&apos;s lands through the Wall.</string>
  <string id="24685" soundid="28656">Around the Heart of the Empire Tavern is the Market District, bustling with open markets and hawkers. It&apos;s vibrant, full of life, and even louder than a battlefield.</string>
  <string id="24686" soundid="28657">They&apos;re learned men and worthy of respect but they can teach me little of the sword. The garden lies across the waterway, past the nobles&apos; houses, and is open day and night.</string>
  <string id="24687" soundid="28658">What would you discuss?</string>
  <string id="24688" soundid="28659">Mind, spirit, and body must all be tested. You can *achieve* peace in a garden, but you *earn* it on the battlefield. Goals reached without trial are not so easily kept.</string>
  <string id="24689" soundid="28660">Many philosophies agree with me, many do not. The ensuing debates are no less a field of battle than this one. Not all battles are fought with weapons.</string>
  <string id="24690" soundid="105597">Good people, I do this for you! Would you have an unproven whelp as your champion? As the Empire&apos;s champion?</string>
  <string id="24691" soundid="28662">I wish you all the best when we step into the ring. Tell Qui whenever you are ready.</string>
  <string id="24692" soundid="151545">I might be able to take you there. You&apos;ll have to pay me now, and I&apos;m not promising you won&apos;t get killed once we get there.</string>
  <string id="24693" soundid="151546">It&apos;s your life, friend. No refunds either. Follow me.</string>
  <string id="24694" soundid="28665">May your battles bring you peace.</string>
  <string id="24700" soundid="151549"></string>
  <string id="24701" soundid="151550"></string>
  <string id="24708">Do you know anything about recruiters for the Lotus Assassins?</string>
  <string id="24714">Everyone has a price, Zi Bao. I&apos;ll pay you 2,000 silver.</string>
  <string id="24715">Lotus Assassin Wizard</string>
  <string id="24716">Spirit Realm</string>
  <string id="24719">Lucky Cho mentioned the Guild. I need to know your thoughts on them. </string>
  <string id="24720">What can you tell me about the Serpent?</string>
  <string id="24723">What role does the Guild play?</string>
  <string id="24726">Why does the Empire put up with the Guild?</string>
  <string id="24727">Let&apos;s talk about something else.</string>
  <string id="24728">Can I ask you a few questions about the arena?</string>
  <string id="24729">How is this arena structured?</string>
  <string id="24731">That&apos;s fine. Let&apos;s go.</string>
  <string id="24732">How do I start fighting?</string>
  <string id="24733">[Intimidation] Take me to the slavers or I&apos;ll break your neck!</string>
  <string id="24734">Will my record at other tournaments affect my standings here?</string>
  <string id="24735">Can you teach me to fight as you did?</string>
  <string id="24736">Let&apos;s go back to my other questions.</string>
  <string id="24737">I have some questions about the fighters here in the arena.</string>
  <string id="24740">I&apos;d like to hear about you, Khana.</string>
  <string id="24742">[Follow Zi Bao]</string>
  <string id="24743">Tell me about Hapless Han.</string>
  <string id="24745">[Let him go]</string>
  <string id="24746">What can you tell me about the beasts?</string>
  <string id="24748" soundid="151568">Bao, you know better than to summon me without a good reason. I hate this accursed, beast-reeking place.</string>
  <string id="24749">Let&apos;s go back to my other questions.</string>
  <string id="24750">Let&apos;s talk about the Imperial City.</string>
  <string id="24751">Just tell me about the city in general.</string>
  <string id="24753">I want to hear about the area around here.</string>
  <string id="24754" soundid="151570">Sure... what do you want to know?</string>
  <string id="24755">Tell me about the Scholars&apos; Garden.</string>
  <string id="24756">Can I ask you some questions?</string>
  <string id="24757">Let&apos;s talk about something else.</string>
  <string id="24758">You clearly dislike this place. Why not just leave?</string>
  <string id="24759">That makes a certain kind of sense.</string>
  <string id="24760">Do you think about such boring drivel all the time? Pathetic!</string>
  <string id="24761" soundid="105598"></string>
  <string id="24762">That&apos;s all I want to ask you for now.</string>
  <string id="24763" soundid="28734">You look a shade better than the usual cowardly dogs we get through here. Just a shade, though.</string>
  <string id="24764" soundid="33285">So... you have an interest in the Lotus Assassins. Very few people risk our attention by seeking us out in public.</string>
  <string id="24765" soundid="33286">I find your bold nature refreshing, but we under Death&apos;s Hand recruit only the very best. All others are cast down before us.</string>
  <string id="24768">You have successfully completed this quest by killing the Lotus Assassin and bringing news of his death back to the Abbot.</string>
  <string id="24770" soundid="28741">If you think defeating Khana impresses me, you&apos;re wrong.</string>
  <string id="24771" soundid="28742">You ground the Hapless one beneath your feet, like everyone else does, huh? Han&apos;s pathetic for wasting time on the hopefuls, if you ask me.</string>
  <string id="24772" soundid="28743">If I waste time talking to you, it&apos;s because I can respect that you&apos;re prepared to lose terribly in the arena.</string>
  <string id="24773" soundid="177256">It feels odd to have lived with an image of the Empire for so long and to lose it so quickly. I miss... I miss Two Rivers. I miss Jing Woo, Old Ming, Gujin....</string>
  <string id="24774" soundid="131869">You&apos;ve done well. With Fang out of the picture, we can assign his post to somebody less difficult. Somebody pliable and easy to control. Somebody like Sheng.</string>
  <string id="24775" soundid="131870">Sheng has no backbone; no will of his own. Things will go much more smoothly for the Lotus Assassins with a puppet like him running the Ministry of Harmony.</string>
  <string id="24777" soundid="177257">I remember lessons in the school, and you making some joke that had Smiling Mountain snickering under his breath even as he scolded us for not paying attention.</string>
  <string id="24780" soundid="60155">I&apos;m just a little girl, and I&apos;m a spirit. I have nothing I can give you. But this is such a small thing for you, and it means so much to me. Please, won&apos;t you help me?</string>
  <string id="24782" soundid="177258">What do you remember about those days?</string>
  <string id="24783" soundid="177259">I keep all our fallen friends in mind. With all the spirits I see, it would be hard not to. I see the walls between this world and the next as very thin.</string>
  <string id="24784" soundid="28755">Yeah, I saw your name on the rosters. I see a lot of names on the rosters; half of &apos;em run home to their mother before their first fight.</string>
  <string id="24785" soundid="28756">So don&apos;t get all chummy with me. I haven&apos;t the time for fawning adoration from the novices.</string>
  <string id="24786">I have his resignation right here.</string>
  <string id="24787">I blackmailed him into it.</string>
  <string id="24788" soundid="28759">Looks like you&apos;re still walking after that last match. Too bad.</string>
  <string id="24789" soundid="28760">I should probably say something encouraging since this was your first win ever, but frankly, I don&apos;t care.</string>
  <string id="24790" soundid="28761">You ground the Hapless one beneath your feet, like everyone else does, huh? Han&apos;s pathetic for wasting time on the hopefuls, if you ask me.</string>
  <string id="24791" soundid="28762">If you think defeating Khana impresses me, you&apos;re wrong.</string>
  <string id="24793" soundid="28764">Surprising. Most of the time you qualifiers hurt yourselves more than your opponent.</string>
  <string id="24794" soundid="28765">I&apos;m sure Khana will fix that once you challenge her for the division championship.</string>
  <string id="24795" soundid="28766">You just watch yourself. Qui will be sending you to see me if you keep that up, and I&apos;ll break you in two.</string>
  <string id="24796" soundid="28767">A big Gold Division win for you?</string>
  <string id="24797" soundid="28768">Can&apos;t really hold your own, can you?</string>
  <string id="24798" soundid="28769">How did you even make it this far? Dumb luck, or was everyone else having a bad day? Feel free to try again if you think you can handle it.</string>
  <string id="24799" soundid="28770">This is the part where the hopefuls usually give up and go home. When you can&apos;t even win your first challenge, it&apos;s time to go back to the farm.</string>
  <string id="24800" soundid="28771">If you&apos;re stalled behind one of the hopefuls, you&apos;ll never go anywhere.</string>
  <string id="24801" soundid="28772">The Bronze Division&apos;s not for green stalks like yourself. Go toughen up for a few years in the Imperial Army and then come back.</string>
  <string id="24802" soundid="28773">You&apos;re just another bug trying to reach my level, and it&apos;s clearly not going to happen.</string>
  <string id="24803" soundid="28774">You shouldn&apos;t give up. Just keep flinging yourself at the Gold Division, it should be entertaining.</string>
  <string id="24805" soundid="28776">What do you want now?</string>
  <string id="24806" soundid="28777">Those Lotus scum wouldn&apos;t know a fair fight if it were praying in their family temple. </string>
  <string id="24807" soundid="28778">There is, however, a vulture around here who picks off the young fighters once they become the Silver Division champion. Tried to recruit me, even.</string>
  <string id="24809">Guard</string>
  <string id="24810" soundid="70027">Hello, my name is Fourth Brother Yu, and you must be the new prodigy. First Brother told us to watch out for you. He said that you&apos;re very talented. </string>
  <string id="24812" soundid="45855">Time with you, however, seems as if consumed by the Devourers of Moments that figured so prominently in the writings of Peng the Unpunctual.</string>
  <string id="24813" soundid="70028">Since you&apos;ve defeated Fifth Brother, perhaps you&apos;d let me decide just how talented you are. Care for a match?</string>
  <string id="24815" soundid="145677">A good name, is it not? Drives fear into the commoners. Yes, that miscreant will be turned in soon enough, and pity the &quot;Scourge&quot; that shows up in my city!</string>
  <string id="24819">Guard</string>
  <string id="24820" soundid="70029">Let&apos;s go then.</string>
  <string id="24824">Dirge Fountain Seal</string>
  <string id="24825">x</string>
  <string id="24836" soundid="175160">Your move, old goat.</string>
  <string id="24846" soundid="33318">You&apos;ve already spoken with my counterpart in the arena, but his priorities are different than mine. Tell me, why have you sought us out?</string>
  <string id="24849" soundid="33321">I have been waiting for you to return. My sources tell me the problem of Minister Sheng and his report to Judge Fang is... no longer a problem.</string>
  <string id="24850" soundid="108283">This is getting too crowded. I doubt there&apos;ll be enough enemies to go around.</string>
  <string id="24852" soundid="108284">Shut up, you oaf, this is important.</string>
  <string id="24853" soundid="28824">I look forward to ending your career in the next match.</string>
  <string id="24854" soundid="28825">Why are you wasting time with me, anyway? Shouldn&apos;t you be taunting your next victim?</string>
  <string id="24855" soundid="33322">I must applaud your efforts. Judge Fang is outraged... it will be months before he agrees to meet with Minister Sheng again.</string>
  <string id="24856" soundid="28827">Good, go bother someone else.</string>
  <string id="24857" soundid="33323">I do not approve of your methods, however. Killing Fang was hardly a subtle way to handle things.</string>
  <string id="24859" soundid="33324">So I ask you, why have you sought us out? Why shouldn&apos;t I just kill you where you stand?</string>
  <string id="24860" soundid="33325">We are not a club you simply petition for admittance. In fact, I find it hard to believe anyone could be so audacious as to look me in the face and make such a brash statement.</string>
  <string id="24862" soundid="127130">I have studied the martial arts all my life, and serve your master as I am able. He is devoted to your training, and needs someone to assist the other students.</string>
  <string id="24863" soundid="126499">This town was once a worthless boil on the back-end of the Empire. It was doomed and dying, a pit of despair. Then Minister Sheng arrived, and all was well.</string>
  <string id="24864" soundid="126500">The dam was closed and prosperity reigned. Surely Sheng will be rewarded with a new posting back at the Imperial City.</string>
  <string id="24867" soundid="33327">You dare to threaten a Lotus Assassin? The bravery of such a reckless act is impressive, though I wonder about the intelligence behind your words.</string>
  <string id="24870">I need help finding a recruiter for the Lotus Assassins.</string>
  <string id="24882" soundid="33330">Your words are true, though you would be wise not to speak them so openly. The Lotus Assassins, and we Inquisitors in particular, prefer to work from the shadows.</string>
  <string id="24920">Are you always this belligerent?</string>
  <string id="24921" soundid="108285">I thought we should talk before... well, this could be very dangerous.</string>
  <string id="24922" soundid="108286">Both of us, I wonder?</string>
  <string id="24923" soundid="108287">You cheapen the importance of this, Princess. He could die in there.</string>
  <string id="24924">I&apos;ll talk to you later, Soldier.</string>
  <string id="24925" soundid="28896">The brothers Sung greet our fellow combatant warmly. I am Sung Bo, and this is my little brother Bu and my older brother Sui.</string>
  <string id="24926" soundid="32830">I wouldn&apos;t want to be the one responsible for destroying the Emperor&apos;s tomb.</string>
  <string id="24927" soundid="32831">The Outlander in the Scholars&apos; Garden is very loud. Perhaps he thinks we&apos;ll understand him better if he shouts.</string>
  <string id="24928" soundid="32832">That Outlander talks like a wounded duck. I&apos;ve never heard such strange sounding words before. </string>
  <string id="24929" soundid="32833">My uncle saw a ghost while traveling in the south. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll be traveling that way anytime soon.</string>
  <string id="24930" soundid="32834">Those Lotus Assassins make me nervous. They just look so... unnatural.</string>
  <string id="24931" soundid="32835">I&apos;ve heard rumors of a young hero making quite a stir in Tien&apos;s Landing.</string>
  <string id="24932" soundid="32836">I haven&apos;t seen any ghosts wandering in the city. And I hope I never do!</string>
  <string id="24933" soundid="32837">Smoke and flames coming from the Necropolis... bad tidings indeed.</string>
  <string id="24934" soundid="32838">First ghosts, now this. The Necropolis is just not a safe place at all.</string>
  <string id="24936" soundid="28907">We will admit that our first loss to you worried us, but to have faced the future Imperial Champion and lost is an appropriate path for any to walk.</string>
  <string id="24937" soundid="28908">What may we do for the champion?</string>
  <string id="24942" soundid="106849">This general sounds far more honorable than Soldier. Just defeat Soldier fairly, I say.</string>
  <string id="24943" soundid="106850">In a choice between the Iron Soldier and the Stone General, I&apos;d take on the entire battalion.</string>
  <string id="24946" soundid="28917">How very strange that your name appears on the rosters, but your body has yet to appear in the ring.</string>
  <string id="24947" soundid="28918">This is indeed reminiscent of the reign of the Blood Dynasty&apos;s third emperor, notorious for having no policies, opinions, or even motion in the later years of his rule. </string>
  <string id="24948" soundid="28919">The brothers Sung fight as one, and yet you fight as if you were three!</string>
  <string id="24949" soundid="28920">While the match invited the toothless donkey of unhappiness to our stable, we still praise your skills.</string>
  <string id="24950" soundid="28921">Look who stands before us, brothers!</string>
  <string id="24951" soundid="28922">A new warrior, flush with first victory. How very quaint!</string>
  <string id="24952" soundid="28923">You are the unstoppable force that left poor Han a cluttered pile of optimistic wreckage at the side of the arena.</string>
  <string id="24953" soundid="28924">The newest champion of the Bronze Division. We shall have to keep an eye on you. Very few climb so far so quickly.</string>
  <string id="24954" soundid="28925">The one who stands just below us in the rankings: our new Silver Division champion.</string>
  <string id="24955" soundid="28926">A recent winner from the qualifying round. How quaint.</string>
  <string id="24956" soundid="28927">The new fighter who is so quickly closing on Crimson Khana&apos;s position.</string>
  <string id="24957" soundid="28928">Why, it&apos;s the reason for Soldier&apos;s increased surliness. Congratulations on managing the impossible!</string>
  <string id="24958" soundid="28929">One who needs no introduction, I&apos;m sure. We watch most avidly to see how the little drama between you and Kai Lan turns out.</string>
  <string id="24959" soundid="28930">Disappointment itself approaches us.</string>
  <string id="24960" soundid="28931">Consider yourself draped in the starry shawl of fortune, for in your loss you have avoided facing your doom.</string>
  <string id="24961" soundid="28932">I&apos;m uncertain what advice to give you this early in your career. I would suggest that you try to hit them more than they hit you.</string>
  <string id="24962" soundid="28933">Do not worry yourself, though! No one really cares about the fights at your level, so who will remember your shame?</string>
  <string id="24963" soundid="28934">If such weak competition overwhelmed you, you might want to reconsider your career path.</string>
  <string id="24964" soundid="28935">The silver round is not for the faint of heart. Consider your inner balance before you enter the ring again.</string>
  <string id="24965" soundid="28936">There is no shame in defeat at this level. Even we cannot defeat the Ravager.</string>
  <string id="24966" soundid="28937">Bah! Be gone! The brothers Sung will waste no words on a boorish competitor.</string>
  <string id="24967" soundid="28938">You would speak again with the Sung brothers? How fascinating that we have earned so much of your attention.</string>
  <string id="24968" soundid="28939">They know better than to bother the brothers Sung! Still, one of their recruiters keeps an eye on the standings here. </string>
  <string id="24969" soundid="28940">Indeed, many young fighters on the cusp of the Gold Division have walked away in pursuit of... another ideal.</string>
  <string id="24970" soundid="32839">It&apos;s finally safe to go back to the Scholars&apos; Garden now that the Outlander has been dealt with.</string>
  <string id="24971" soundid="28942">Your expansive friend returns on a dark fall of the cards, I&apos;m afraid. His story, like all stories where brothers fall out, is not lightly told.</string>
  <string id="24972" soundid="28943">The Black Whirlwind and Raging Ox had a confrontation. No really knows what happened, but suffice it to say Ox remained here.</string>
  <string id="24973" soundid="28944">Raging Ox continued to rise through the ranks to become champion, while your friend left his brother, and the arena, behind.</string>
  <string id="24974" soundid="45858">I don&apos;t think anyone would have expected the champion to lose. It may have been just an exhibition fight, but you still gave it your all.</string>
  <string id="24975" soundid="28946">No one knows where Raging Ox has gone. He spent some time as champion, but then Kai Lan informed us that Ox had retired and was leaving the arena.</string>
  <string id="24976" soundid="28947">It&apos;s a shame. Everyone enjoyed his jovial personality, and he was a fair sight more pleasant than the Ravager.</string>
  <string id="24977">Support Style
Does direct damage in Chi Strike mode
This style&apos;s Power Attack can initiate a Harmonic Combo that produces a Health power-up.

Fighters skilled in Heavenly Wave learn techniques that can slow their opponents to a crawl. While this Support style does no damage on its own, a master can manipulate the chi in the area around opponents, rendering them sluggish and easily defeated. Even the most lightning-fast of foes can be slowed to a turtle&apos;s pace with the skillful application of Heavenly Wave. </string>
  <string id="24978" soundid="28949">Has there not already been a reaction of sorts? Kai Lan likely wants nothing more than his ex-star fighter to leave this place. Of course, that means he wants the same of you.</string>
  <string id="24979" soundid="28950">The Black Whirlwind was never one to follow rules, and Kai Lan is one who demands that his rules be followed.</string>
  <string id="24981" soundid="28952">Good! I don&apos;t like even listening to this kind of thing.</string>
  <string id="24982" soundid="28953">We can tell you to be careful whom you ask about such things. Secrets kept in the open are the most sensitive.</string>
  <string id="24983" soundid="28954">The serpent who dwells in the shadows of this place. Like an air spirit, he is everywhere and yet invisible to the eye.</string>
  <string id="24984" soundid="28955">Brother Sui puts it well. Kai Lan the Serpent is the Guild&apos;s will in this place, powerful enough that only the brave or foolish discuss him at any length.</string>
  <string id="24985" soundid="32840">That Outlander thought he was better than all of us. I doubt he&apos;ll be so arrogant in the future.</string>
  <string id="24986" soundid="28957">Besides running the most expansive betting operation in the Empire? I speculate that they do much more than that, but we have been smart enough not to find out.</string>
  <string id="24987" soundid="28958">We question things in the arena, though. For example, why are we allowed to fight as one body when the rules suggest such a thing should be illegal?</string>
  <string id="24988" soundid="28959">I agree! I don&apos;t want them around any more, they scare me.</string>
  <string id="24989" soundid="32841">That Outlander finally got his due. Hopefully, he&apos;s learned to be more tolerant.</string>
  <string id="24990" soundid="28961">A wise choice; the Guild always prefers that people not speak of them. What do you need to know?</string>
  <string id="24991">Crane</string>
  <string id="24996">To Two Rivers</string>
  <string id="24997" soundid="32842">It&apos;s about time somebody dealt with that annoying Outlander.</string>
  <string id="24998" soundid="28969">You have earned the right to ask about your peers.</string>
  <string id="24999" soundid="28970">Would you like to know about Soldier, or our current champion, the Ravager?</string>
  <string id="25000" soundid="32843">Please, don&apos;t hurt me. I never said anything against the Lotus Assassins, honestly.</string>
  <string id="25001" soundid="32844">I see the Lotus Assassins have gotten to you, too. I mean... not that there&apos;s anything wrong with that.</string>
  <string id="25002" soundid="32845">I&apos;ve never said an unkind word about the Lotus Assassins. Not one. Ever.</string>
  <string id="25003" soundid="32846">Didn&apos;t I see you talking with the Lotus Assassins earlier? Or was it that other strange looking... ah, er... never mind.</string>
  <string id="25004" soundid="28975">There is something unnatural about that one.</string>
  <string id="25005" soundid="28976">He smells bad, too, like he&apos;s sick all the time or something.</string>
  <string id="25006" soundid="28977">Of course. What did you want to know?</string>
  <string id="25007" soundid="28978">We should not discuss the city, Brother, while we are within its bounds. </string>
  <string id="25008" soundid="28979">Do the stars show the dragons in ascension again? Then we should not speak of the city for now. The very topic is risky.</string>
  <string id="25009" soundid="32847">I have seen many Arena Champions come and go, and I can honestly say, that you&apos;re one of them.</string>
  <string id="25010" soundid="32848">I knew you would win your championship fight when I first saw you. The heavens favor you greatly.</string>
  <string id="25011" soundid="32849">I only wish I had seen you defeat the Ravager with my own eyes. I didn&apos;t think anyone could beat him.</string>
  <string id="25012" soundid="28983">How dare you mock our family unity?</string>
  <string id="25013" soundid="28984">Indeed. We deal with enough ignorance of the ancient ways and customs of the Empire; we do not need additional abuse.</string>
  <string id="25014" soundid="32850">Aren&apos;t you the new Arena Champion? What good fortune to actually meet you in person!</string>
  <string id="25015" soundid="32851">You should be careful now that you&apos;ve done well in the arena. You might draw unwanted attention.</string>
  <string id="25016" soundid="32852">I lost plenty of silver betting against you. Next time, my money&apos;s on you.</string>
  <string id="25017" soundid="32853">You&apos;ve done well so far in the arena, but I&apos;m not sure you&apos;re a match for the Ravager.</string>
  <string id="25018" soundid="32854">I&apos;ve heard about your exploits in the arena. Very impressive for a first-timer.</string>
  <string id="25020" soundid="32855">I&apos;ve seen what happens to some of the arena fighters. It isn&apos;t pretty.</string>
  <string id="25026" soundid="106851">Iron Soldier&apos;s offer is too lucrative to be strictly honorable. He&apos;s appealing to your greed, so there&apos;s obviously more to this story.</string>
  <string id="25032">Do you know anything about recruiters for the Lotus Assassins?</string>
  <string id="25035">I need to know about the Black Whirlwind and Kai Lan.</string>
  <string id="25036">Why did the Black Whirlwind leave the arena?</string>
  <string id="25038">Where can I find the Black Whirlwind&apos;s brother?</string>
  <string id="25040">How do you think Kai Lan will react to the Black Whirlwind&apos;s return?</string>
  <string id="25042">Let&apos;s talk about something else.</string>
  <string id="25043">What can you tell me about the Guild?</string>
  <string id="25044">Who is Kai Lan?</string>
  <string id="25046" soundid="32856">My grandfather fought in the arena... once.</string>
  <string id="25047">What does the Guild do here, exactly?</string>
  <string id="25049" soundid="32857">You look tough, but I&apos;m not sure if you have what it takes to win in the arena.</string>
  <string id="25050">Why doesn&apos;t the Empire just stop the Guild?</string>
  <string id="25051">I want to ask about something else.</string>
  <string id="25052" soundid="127133">I can arrange for a little sparring. Are there any special conditions you would like to introduce? I know you prefer a challenge.</string>
  <string id="25054" soundid="31892">Minister Sheng has very little to say. There is a rumor that the Great Dam is broken. We are doomed. No goods can enter the town. No fish can be taken from the river.</string>
  <string id="25055" soundid="31893">Perhaps I did not do enough. May I confide something in you?</string>
  <string id="25056" soundid="31894">I am not nearly as capable as I let on. It is even possible that my banishment here was not entirely because of the jealousy of others.</string>
  <string id="25057" soundid="31895">It may have been due to my numerous failings in the Imperial City. But I am sure you don&apos;t want to listen to the ramblings of a tired, broken man.</string>
  <string id="25058" soundid="31896">What can I do for you?</string>
  <string id="25059" soundid="31897">Very well then, Minister Sheng shall carry the burden of his misery alone. What can I do for you?</string>
  <string id="25060" soundid="31898">Not at all! I may even mention you in my report.</string>
  <string id="25061">Can we talk about some of the fighters around here?</string>
  <string id="25062" soundid="32858">So you&apos;re the new fighter in town. Good luck, you&apos;ll need it.</string>
  <string id="25064" soundid="32859">That Outlander in the Scholars&apos; Garden has a terrible weapon, the likes of which I&apos;ve never seen before.</string>
  <string id="25065" soundid="32860">Apparently the Outlander is causing some problems in the Scholars&apos; Garden.</string>
  <string id="25067">What&apos;s the story with Soldier?</string>
  <string id="25070">Tell me about the Ravager, then.</string>
  <string id="25073">Let&apos;s go back to my other questions.</string>
  <string id="25074">Let&apos;s talk about the city in general.</string>
  <string id="25082">I&apos;m growing tired of having three conversations. Even if you can&apos;t fight alone, you should be able to talk alone.</string>
  <string id="25086">That&apos;s all I need from you three for now.</string>
  <string id="25120">Pirate</string>
  <string id="25141" soundid="29153">How&apos;d I know you&apos;d be deadly in a fight? You&apos;ll have to accept my apologies for dragging you into that, but I can&apos;t afford to be stopped. Not now.</string>
  <string id="25186">How did you end up here?</string>
  <string id="25187">Your plan didn&apos;t work out too well.</string>
  <string id="25189">Player Backed Out of the Play</string>
  <string id="25190">Apple</string>
  <string id="25243">I didn&apos;t want to kill him. He left me no choice.</string>
  <string id="25244">Gao brought his fate on himself.</string>
  <string id="25246">I enjoyed killing your son... now I&apos;m going to kill you!</string>
  <string id="25254" soundid="150747">What? Oh... you... you&apos;re the one with the flyer aren&apos;t you? Forgive my impertinence, but do you own that flyer perhaps?</string>
  <string id="25255" soundid="150748">No, you&apos;re right. I don&apos;t mean to offend, but if you would allow me, I would like to make it my business.</string>
  <string id="25259" soundid="150749">I am Hin Goo, a mechanic and a businessman. I supply upgrades to people fortunate enough to have flyers.</string>
  <string id="25261" soundid="71818">Spirit? I&apos;m not dead, you idiot! If I were, would I be this upset about losing my house? Or breathing, for that matter?</string>
  <string id="25262" soundid="71819">So, that&apos;s how this goes, is it? Who is paying you? My son? Shen? First, my son catches me sleeping and convinces everyone I&apos;d died, then he gets the damn gravedigger to bury me!</string>
  <string id="25263" soundid="71820">With all the real ghosts coming up out of their graves, no one wants to get close enough to find out the truth. That young bastard has stolen my life! Well, what&apos;s left of it.</string>
  <string id="25264" soundid="71821">With no place to go, and everyone running in fear from the &quot;ghost,&quot; where else could I go? I built this house from the ground up, and I&apos;m not about to let him take it from me!</string>
  <string id="25265" soundid="71822">They sent the quick one, didn&apos;t they?</string>
  <string id="25266" soundid="71823">No, I&apos;m not dead, you idiot!</string>
  <string id="25267" soundid="71824">My son just used that as an excuse to take everything!</string>
  <string id="25268" soundid="71825">Why do you think? Money, the house, my business that I spent 20 years making....</string>
  <string id="25270" soundid="165564">Still don&apos;t trust my intentions? Have a little faith that sometimes fate provides answers when they&apos;re needed most. Either way, we need to deal with that door.</string>
  <string id="25272">This seems awfully convenient.</string>
  <string id="25303">Thousand Cuts</string>
  <string id="25331" soundid="45785">The water kept rising. And rising. And then we died. But the quarry is still ours, even when we&apos;re dead! And now you&apos;ll join us!</string>
  <string id="25384" soundid="70032">As you wish. If you&apos;d like to try a match later, come and see me.</string>
  <string id="25386">Pirate</string>
  <string id="25387" soundid="70033">Good to see you again. What can I do for you?</string>
  <string id="25389" soundid="70034">You&apos;re one of the best students I&apos;ve ever fought. You&apos;re ready to try your skill against Third Brother. He&apos;ll offer you a much greater challenge.</string>
  <string id="25391">Captain</string>
  <string id="25392" soundid="70035">You have some very impressive moves. With practice, you&apos;ll get even better. Would you like to try another fight?</string>
  <string id="25394" soundid="151651">Do you realize how much trouble you&apos;ve caused me? I&apos;ll be doing paperwork on that fight of yours well into next week.</string>
  <string id="25396">Slave</string>
  <string id="25397" soundid="151652">For so long, it appeared you&apos;d be one of the easy ones. Then that whole bandit attack happened, and I haven&apos;t rested since.</string>
  <string id="25399" soundid="151653">You mortals have no concept of what we celestial bureaucrats have to put up with. Is it really that difficult to stop and, I don&apos;t know... *think* before brandishing your weapons?</string>
  <string id="25401">Slave</string>
  <string id="25404" soundid="70040">I&apos;m not really surprised that you defeated Smiling Hawk. Your skills are absolutely amazing.</string>
  <string id="25406">Slave</string>
  <string id="25407" soundid="70041">With Smiling Hawk out of the way, we can finally get back the respect our school has lost over the past few years.</string>
  <string id="25409" soundid="154743">Maybe we should investigate Fang in the arena first. We might be able to stop him from getting that report without hurting Sheng... or anyone else.</string>
  <string id="25411">Yeung Yifong</string>
  <string id="25416">Pirate</string>
  <string id="25417">Yes, let&apos;s fight!</string>
  <string id="25419" soundid="151654">(Sigh) You have no idea what I&apos;m talking about, do you? I am Zin Bu, the Magic Abacus. I was assigned to record, tabulate, and itemize the destruction that you cause.</string>
  <string id="25421">Kang the Mad</string>
  <string id="25422" soundid="151655">No easy task, I might add, especially since you embarked on this wild quest to find your master.</string>
  <string id="25424" soundid="151656">Our calculations keep the universe in balance. Without us, chaos... anarchy... utter ruination.</string>
  <string id="25427">I need to go. Goodbye.</string>
  <string id="25429" soundid="151657">Ha! Again you show your ignorance. Do you have any idea of the chaos that would be unleashed if we suddenly stopped calculating? It&apos;s ridiculous!</string>
  <string id="25431">Gao the Greater</string>
  <string id="25432" soundid="151658">Look at your associate, Black Whirlwind. What a nightmare. A whole department can&apos;t keep up with his antics!</string>
  <string id="25434">Tseng</string>
  <string id="25436">Grand Inquisitor Jia</string>
  <string id="25446">Slave Breaker</string>
  <string id="25451">Wild Flower</string>
  <string id="25461">Xianshi</string>
  <string id="25466">Pirate Cheung</string>
  <string id="25471" soundid="29789">Now you are in for it! Those guards see you!</string>
  <string id="25472" soundid="29790">Use this! Good for the head breaking!</string>
  <string id="25473" soundid="197955"></string>
  <string id="25476">I closed the dam. The Lotus Assassins removed the amulet.</string>
  <string id="25477" soundid="166499">[You have placed the powder in the pan.]</string>
  <string id="25482" soundid="29800">Hey, ha ha! Much kicking and such. It really gets the blood flowing. And explosions... lots of blood flowing from those, too.</string>
  <string id="25483" soundid="29801">Now, we should leave here! We can make it as far as that nearby town, Tien&apos;s Landing. I know the winds between here and there. Mostly. I mostly know the winds. It will be fine.</string>
  <string id="25484" soundid="29802">Ha ha! Everybody on board! The Marvelous Dragonfly is about to take flight!</string>
  <string id="25490" soundid="29808">This is good, too!  Ooh! That&apos;s going to hurt!</string>
  <string id="25491" soundid="29809">You handled the guards well, with your punching and the kicking. I was going to make more of an explody thing, but the kicking worked well, too.</string>
  <string id="25493" soundid="29811">Not so. You may have adequate feet for the kicking, but your eyes are not so good at judging. I only work for Gao because he forces me to.</string>
  <string id="25494" soundid="29812">I make all sorts of things and, yes, many are designed to expend energy, ah, quickly. But my greatest prize does not explode. Much. Something I have kept for myself.</string>
  <string id="25496" soundid="29814">I am Kang the Mad. I make things explode, and I make things fly, and I am very good at both. The things I fly tend to survive. The things I explode... not so much.</string>
  <string id="25497" soundid="29815">My greatest invention is in the launch room upstairs. Light and fast, she has weapons and capacity no other flyer does. The Marvelous Dragonfly!</string>
  <string id="25506" soundid="29824">What else can I do? Er, actually, not all that much. I mean, I can bolt any two things together and maybe a forest burns down, but flight is where I shine.</string>
  <string id="25507" soundid="29825">You don&apos;t need it now, but soon you&apos;ll wonder how you ever did without. I was the same, long ago. &quot;Flyers don&apos;t need weapons,&quot; I thought. I tried to keep them pure.</string>
  <string id="25509" soundid="110005">My best guess would be guards willing to die for their master. You shouldn&apos;t have too much trouble helping them reach that goal.</string>

  <string id="25512" soundid="29830">Of course, of course, take what you will, but if you will, er, want the Dragonfly, you&apos;ll need me. She&apos;s a delicate creation, in need of constant maintenance.</string>
  <string id="25513" soundid="29831">Anyway, you go ahead, and once all the kicking is done, I&apos;ll come along, and we&apos;ll see what&apos;s what! For now, let me think! We&apos;ll need explosives... that explode.</string>
  <string id="25515">Who are you?</string>
  <string id="25517">I do what I want and take what I want.</string>
  <string id="25519">There was nothing there. I&apos;m tracking the Lotus Assassins elsewhere.</string>

  <string id="25553">I have no need of your toys.</string>
  <string id="25556">You recover more quickly from exiting Focus mode.</string>

  <string id="25598" soundid="36721">I was tasked with protection of the amulet and the gems that are a part of it. But to do that, I had to enter the mortal realm, where they were.</string>
  <string id="25600" soundid="36723">Two treasures were entrusted to me: an amulet and a gem. Both are items of great power, but I do not know what they do. I only know they are meant for you.</string>
  <string id="25601" soundid="36724">They came only a few days ago, looking for the amulet and the gem I protected. There were many of them... too many. They attacked me all at once.</string>

  <string id="26006">Large Damage Increase</string>
  <string id="26018" soundid="139490">Hey! Leave our novices alone. If you want to fight, you can fight me!</string>
  <string id="26020" soundid="139491">Peace, Third Brother. That is no way to treat a guest.</string>
  <string id="26023" soundid="110294">You again. Why are you still pestering me? Don&apos;t you have something better to do?</string>
  <string id="26025" soundid="139492">Good. You&apos;ll need to speak with each of the brothers and ask them to fight with you. I&apos;m sure they&apos;ll be more than eager to oblige.</string>
  <string id="26028" soundid="139493">It is... complicated. If you prove yourself, I&apos;m sure that Master Radiant will be more than happy to explain it to you.</string>
  <string id="26030" soundid="139494">It is not just his fighting skills that make him dangerous. Master Smiling Hawk&apos;s need for power consumes him. He cannot be trusted.</string>
  <string id="26033" soundid="110295">Out, out, out! The dining hall is a mess, and I doubt you&apos;re here to help me clean!</string>
  <string id="26045" soundid="139495">For now, be careful and focus on defeating the brothers. Start with Sixth Brother and ask him to fight with you. I&apos;m sure he&apos;ll be eager.</string>
  <string id="26048" soundid="139496">Once you&apos;ve defeated all of the brothers, come and see me. Good luck.</string>
  <string id="26050" soundid="70120">Hello again. What can I do for you today?</string>
  <string id="26053" soundid="139497">I see. Well, if you change your mind, come back and see me. In the meantime, I should get back to the students. Goodbye and good luck.</string>
  <string id="26055" soundid="139498">Ah, welcome back. Have you changed your mind about joining our school? Say the word, and I&apos;ll ask our masters.</string>
  <string id="26058" soundid="139499">You still haven&apos;t defeated any of the brothers yet.</string>
  <string id="26060" soundid="139500">Certainly. What would you like to know?</string>
  <string id="26065" soundid="139501">Third Brother Renshan is probably the most gifted fighter I&apos;ve ever seen. None here at the school, except the masters, are his equal.</string>
  <string id="26068" soundid="139502">Unfortunately, Third Brother is a terrible leader and poor teacher. Much like Master Smiling Hawk, he cares nothing for the other students or the school.</string>
  <string id="26070" soundid="139503">Third Brother has gained his rank on shear skill, but I doubt he will climb higher. It takes more than martial skill to be a master.</string>
  <string id="26088" soundid="70135">For surely the Emperor must have been surveying the cold plains he had just conquered in the name of enlightenment. </string>

  <string id="26265" soundid="30670">I have concerns about their order, but I will not voice them here. Not in the city where even the shadows have ears.</string>
  <string id="26286">Buy from Store</string>
  <string id="26290" soundid="127134">Very well. I&apos;ll choose someone who is competent in one-on-one combat. This is only a practice bout, so fight until your opponent is knocked out. Get ready.</string>
  <string id="26292" soundid="127136">Interesting. I have a number of students who would benefit from being on either side of such a bout. Perhaps as many as four.</string>
  <string id="26293" soundid="127137">A duo to test their cooperation. Some of the younger students will think you are easy prey in such a situation. Show them the truth.</string>
  <string id="26294" soundid="127138">Remember, this is only a practice match. It will continue until you or your opponents are rendered unconscious.</string>
  <string id="26295" soundid="127139">A trio. Very well. This will be a valuable experience for all involved.</string>
  <string id="26296" soundid="127140">Facing a foursome means that you will have to remain aware of the fighting environment the whole time. Be ready.</string>
  <string id="26297" soundid="127141">Yes, I suppose your fight against the bandits made you want to brush up on this technique. I can arrange for as many as four students to fight you.</string>
  <string id="26298" soundid="127142">Yes, I imagine Gao&apos;s actions have taught you the need to be ready for the unexpected. I can provide as many as four students to spar with you.</string>
  <string id="26299" soundid="127143">I am sorry, but Master Li does not permit such techniques to be flaunted at the school. There is danger in wielding such power if you are not ready.</string>
  <string id="26300" soundid="127144">He does not demonstrate those skills very often. There are paths of the Way that hold great temptation if one is not careful. I can clarify this, but I cannot offer the fight you wish.</string>
  <string id="26302" soundid="127146">You have seen the arrogance of others. Gao is well along the Way of the Closed Fist. I can clarify this, but I cannot offer the fight you wish.</string>
  <string id="26303" soundid="127147">No. Everyone is concerned about Dawn Star. Such distraction could lead to mistakes in the ring, and I don&apos;t want any accidents.</string>
  <string id="26304" soundid="127148">Good luck finding Dawn Star. Stay on the path of honor.</string>
  <string id="26305" soundid="127149">Goodbye. I am here if you need anything.</string>
  <string id="26307" soundid="127150">I heard how you faced those bandits in the village. Many people are impressed, but I expected no less. Your skill is a match for any rough bandit.</string>
  <string id="26308" soundid="127151">Is there anything you need? Perhaps a training session with some of the students? It would do them good.</string>
  <string id="26310" soundid="160017">Even though you let *me* cut the head off of Kai Lan the Serpent, you&apos;re still the arena champion.</string>
  <string id="26345" soundid="127153"></string>
  <string id="26346" soundid="127154">What can I do for you? I am here to serve and train.</string>
  <string id="26347" soundid="127155">Hmm, a surprising outcome, but it is the rush of the stream that smoothes the pebble. You must work to maintain focus.</string>
  <string id="26348" soundid="127156"></string>
  <string id="26350">Can I ask you some things about the school?</string>
  <string id="26351">Tell me about the philosophies you mention.</string>
  <string id="26353">Tell me about the Way of the Open Palm.</string>
  <string id="26355">Give me examples.</string>
  <string id="26356">You met the ghosts of two children at the orphanage in the ruins. They died in the flood because the orphan master, Kindly Yushan, abandoned them. They want your help.</string>
  <string id="26358">Sometimes conflict cannot be avoided.</string>
  <string id="26361">Tell me about the Way of the Closed Fist.</string>
  <string id="26363">So what is it, if it is not &quot;evil?&quot;</string>
  <string id="26368">Sair para a área de trabalho.</string>
  <string id="26409">Sure. Let&apos;s fight.</string>
  <string id="26415" soundid="151659">You, for instance, Black Whirlwind. You&apos;re a nightmare. A whole department can&apos;t keep up with your antics.</string>
  <string id="26416" soundid="151660">But imagine if they failed to record his various... deeds. We would never be able to determine his eventual position on the Great Wheel.</string>
  <string id="26417" soundid="151661">You can&apos;t just guess at it! You must have records. Itemized records, in triplicate, signed by the Overseer of Carnal Destruction and Disorder herself!</string>
  <string id="26418">Tell me about the Black Leopard School.</string>
  <string id="26427">I want to ask you some questions.</string>
  <string id="26428">Tell me about the Lotus Assassins.</string>
  <string id="26429">What were they searching for?</string>
  <string id="26430">Do you know anything about these ruins?</string>
  <string id="26433">I need to go. Goodbye.</string>
  <string id="26437" soundid="162042">I heard you got rid of Lan for me. With her out of the picture, it&apos;s only a matter of time until Bei gives in and we get married!</string>
  <string id="26438" soundid="151662">You don&apos;t know the half of it. You remember that little engagement with Gao the Lesser? Three thousand and forty pages! I lost three assistants on that report alone!</string>
  <string id="26439" soundid="151663">Ah ha! The very reason I&apos;m here, and not back in the Celestial Bureaucracy tabulating your most recent exploits. Apparently my skills are inadequate to keep up with you!</string>
  <string id="26440" soundid="151664">Time? What do you know of time? You just make the messes. *I* have to document them... or I did at least. Apparently my inability to keep up with you has cost me.</string>
  <string id="26441" soundid="151665">I&apos;m being relegated to a much lower role, in trade and commerce. My only consolation is that I will no longer have to track your exploits.</string>
  <string id="26442" soundid="109261">Well, the school is the best of its kind in all the Empire. I consider myself very fortunate to be a student here.</string>
  <string id="26443" soundid="109262">That&apos;s not to say that we don&apos;t have our problems. Having two masters is a bit... unusual, and it seems to slow the progress of the school.</string>
  <string id="26444" soundid="151666">And you&apos;re going to help me. Instead of trying to find you a buyer or supplier wherever you go, I&apos;m going to provide that service directly.</string>
  <string id="26445">Arena Tavern</string>
  <string id="26446">Tell me about the Black Leopard School.</string>
  <string id="26449" soundid="139504">I can&apos;t get into the details of how that came about. However, I can tell you that it was not intended to be that way.</string>
  <string id="26453">Keep your tongue in check, Dawn Star, or you&apos;re next!</string>
  <string id="26490" soundid="151667">I need you to buy from me and sell to me, if you wish. I already have a supplier, a friend of mine from the Untimely Deaths department, who was also demoted recently.</string>
  <string id="26492" soundid="146880">You&apos;re no ghost. Hell, you&apos;re barely human! No one has ever withstood the axes of the Black Whirlwind before!</string>
  <string id="26495" soundid="109272">The school has strong leadership, but we currently suffer from having too many leaders. Two masters is one too many.</string>
  <string id="26497" soundid="109273">I don&apos;t mind Master Radiant, but he is too detached... and too passive. Master Smiling Hawk could regain our respect, if Master Radiant would let him.</string>
  <string id="26498" soundid="109274">I really shouldn&apos;t say any more than I already have. If you are still curious, you can speak to First Brother Kai.</string>
  <string id="26499" soundid="160776">How should I know? He&apos;s probably licking Master Radiant&apos;s sandals... he was always such a devoted follower of that... man.</string>
  <string id="26501" soundid="146881">Congratulations on winning the Bronze Division. But... ah... I... ah....</string>
  <string id="26503">As you wish. Leave, peasant, and never return!</string>
  <string id="26505">Lustful Lao</string>
  <string id="26507" soundid="109276">Of course. Please return if you wish to spar. Good day.</string>
  <string id="26511" soundid="109277">The Black Leopard School is the most prestigious school in the Empire. We accept only the best students.</string>
  <string id="26512" soundid="109278">If the novices would spend more time studying and less time fighting, perhaps they would actually learn something.</string>
  <string id="26513" soundid="109279">I admire First Brother&apos;s ability to teach. He certainly has a way with the students.</string>
  <string id="26514" soundid="109280">If you need more information about the Black Leopard School, please refer your questions to First Brother Kai.</string>
  <string id="26515" soundid="151668">Actually... I need you to buy from me, and occasionally sell any items you no longer need.</string>
  <string id="26517" soundid="151669">By getting rid of the other suppliers and buyers, I can save time and be more efficient. Perhaps then I can regain some of the honor I lost through this demotion.</string>
  <string id="26518" soundid="151670">In any case, I&apos;ll be joining with you, in a sense, to offer you items for sale and to purchase anything extra you acquire. It&apos;s a fair deal, I believe.</string>
  <string id="26520" soundid="139505">A school should only have one master. The... rivalry between our masters is hurting the school and the students.</string>
  <string id="26525">Guard</string>
  <string id="26526" soundid="139506">Of course, neither master wishes to step down. It is a problem that needs to be solved if this school is going to survive.</string>
  <string id="26527" soundid="109288">It is good to have only one master again. Now, the school can focus on its future and move ahead.</string>
  <string id="26529">I don&apos;t believe you. Time to die!</string>
  <string id="26530">Fine. Answer my questions and I&apos;ll let you live.</string>
  <string id="26531">He served our enemy. He deserves only death!</string>
  <string id="26539" soundid="139507">Officially, I follow both. I am First Brother and it is my duty to assist both masters in any way I can.</string>
  <string id="26542" soundid="145344">Be on your guard if you truly mean to pursue him. Gao&apos;s mad with rage, as this poor lad learned too late.</string>
  <string id="26545">What was in the sack?</string>
  <string id="26547" soundid="139508">That being said, I was taught by Master Radiant, and I go to him for advice or learning in a given area.</string>
  <string id="26548">Could it have been a person?</string>
  <string id="26549">If he went toward the gate, maybe I can still catch him.</string>
  <string id="26551" soundid="145352">I would. I would give anything to see her saved, but my techniques are much more advanced than any normal &apos;doctor&apos; could comprehend.</string>
  <string id="26552" soundid="145353">I must do the operation myself or find a savant of such skill that I would feel safe giving them control.</string>
  <string id="26553" soundid="145354">A doctor? Of such skill? Who is it? What is his name? Where did you find such a person?</string>
  <string id="26554" soundid="145355">A doctor... and a woman? Amazing! You think she can help? Please, then, bring her to me! Let me speak with her!</string>
  <string id="26555" soundid="145356">Thank you, stranger! Thank you! Bring her to me and she may be able to help me with the operation.</string>
  <string id="26556" soundid="145357">Please stranger, even if you will not bring this doctor to me, you can still help! If you look, you might find the pristine liver I require!</string>
  <string id="26557" soundid="145358">Yes... yes! It looks like it has been preserved well enough! Although... it seems... a little dark. It feels... odd. But no matter! It is good enough!</string>
  <string id="26558" soundid="145359">Now I must begin quickly. Her life energy is fading fast.</string>
  <string id="26559" soundid="195245"></string>
  <string id="26560" soundid="145361">It looks like the operation has worked. She should be safe now. Her breathing has slowed and her heart rate is returning to normal levels.</string>
  <string id="26561" soundid="145362">It will be some time before she can stand on her own again, but I am certain she will make it. Not here, though... not in this place of death.</string>
  <string id="26562" soundid="145363">No... no! Something is wrong! Quick, come here and help me!</string>
  <string id="26563" soundid="145821">That is your cause. I understand, but you are a fool to fight our inevitable rule. Your Master will learn this, and so shall you.</string>
  <string id="26564" soundid="145365">No! No! It&apos;s not working! The liver functions, but it... it&apos;s just not working!</string>
  <string id="26565" soundid="145366"></string>
  <string id="26566" soundid="145367">You... stranger. You are not like me. You are something different... something special. I noticed it when you first came in. Your energy... your chi, is different.</string>
  <string id="26567" soundid="145368">Please, stranger, I beg of you. Use whatever you can, sacrifice whatever you can so that my daughter will live. Innocence like hers should not have to die in a place like this.</string>
  <string id="26568" soundid="145369"></string>
  <string id="26569" soundid="145370">Stranger... you are... amazing.</string>
  <string id="26570" soundid="146882">I had a stutter once. Put some garlic on it every night, that made it go away. Now, ah... where was I? Oh, yeah.</string>
  <string id="26572" soundid="109289">Hello again. Things are certainly shaping up around here now that Master Radiant is gone.</string>
  <string id="26573" soundid="144610">Strange things have been going on here... ghost troubles and such. I don&apos;t know, but it seems like it&apos;ll soon be too dangerous for even me to stay here.</string>
  <string id="26575" soundid="144611">Sure, sure.</string>
  <string id="26576" soundid="144612">Help! One of those damn spirits came up right in my backyard! The stupid thing won&apos;t let anyone get by! It&apos;s got my tools and everything! Just kill the damn thing!</string>
  <string id="26577" soundid="144613">Haven&apos;t you killed it yet? I can&apos;t do anything without my tools. I can&apos;t get you your reward for anything else, either, &apos;til it&apos;s gone. Just kill it!</string>
  <string id="26578" soundid="139509">Master Smiling Hawk is not interested in teaching the students or the brothers. He seeks only to improve his own abilities.</string>
  <string id="26580">Quit Game</string>
  <string id="26583" soundid="144614">It&apos;s dead then? Heh, good. I knew that old bag would try to come back for me someday. But she wouldn&apos;t have guessed I&apos;d have someone like you on my side. </string>
  <string id="26584" soundid="144615">Eh-heh, yeah, I guess you could say that. She was my mother-in-law. Never once in her life did she say a kind word to me, and now she tried to keep at me even in death.</string>
  <string id="26585" soundid="144616">You got what you deserved! Do you hear me? You deserved it!</string>
  <string id="26586" soundid="144617">Eh-heh, but any good job deserves a reward, of course.</string>
  <string id="26593">Quit the current game and go to the title screen.</string>
  <string id="26594" soundid="51043">A student... here? I had long forgotten the stench of the living.</string>
  <string id="26595" soundid="51044">I ruled this place... taught with wisdom. Why can&apos;t I find my way? Where is the voice that should call to me?</string>
  <string id="26596" soundid="51045">Master, student, farmer... whatever I was, I should be dust. Instead, I am pulled to nowhere. Frustration!</string>
  <string id="26598" soundid="51046">Lies? You cannot see the lie! The lie pulls us nowhere! Frustration!</string>
  <string id="26599" soundid="51047">The living understand nothing! The living cannot feel the pull to nowhere! The frustration!</string>
  <string id="26600" soundid="51048">The way is blocked, the shepherd is gone! Cannot escape the living. Milling... stinking... you cloud the way!</string>
  <string id="26601" soundid="51049">To judgment and to be renewed, but the way of things has been unbalanced! No souls return to the living.</string>
  <string id="26602" soundid="51050">Desire! Arrogance! The way of things is broken! No souls return to the living.</string>
  <string id="26603" soundid="51051">You can see nothing, but soon you will know! The number grows ever larger! No souls return to the living.</string>
  <string id="26604" soundid="51052">What will become of the world if no souls are replenished? Eventually there will be an end. You are blind to the danger, blind to the truth.</string>
  <string id="26610" soundid="145372">Wait! What... what is that?</string>
  <string id="26611" soundid="145822">Enough talk. I will delay your death no longer! May your fall sate the anger of Death&apos;s Hand, will of the Emperor!</string>
  <string id="26612" soundid="145374">You! You have driven me out of her--*my* liver, but I&apos;ll have my vengeance yet! I&apos;ll destroy you and her both!</string>
  <string id="26613" soundid="145823">You are foolish to think one such as he can be intimidated. He is a force beyond what you can understand. All of the Lotus Assassins know his power.</string>
  <string id="26614" soundid="145376">No! Please! I&apos;ll give you anything I can, I just need you to--What? W-wait a minute. She&apos;s stopped trembling.</string>
  <string id="26615" soundid="145377"></string>
  <string id="26616" soundid="145378">Her breathing has slowed, and her heart rate is returning to normal levels. It... it worked! She&apos;s saved!</string>
  <string id="26617" soundid="145379">Thank you, stranger, for what you have done for me. As I promised, I will give you all that I have left. Everything else was spent in pursuit of this dream.</string>
  <string id="26618" soundid="145380">I must take her to a place where she can heal. You have my eternal gratitude for what you have done.</string>
  <string id="26619" soundid="145381">Yes... yes! It looks like it has been preserved well enough! I am amazed that you managed to get this intact.</string>
  <string id="26620" soundid="145382">Her... her breathing has slowed, and her heart rate is returning to normal levels. Whatever you did, stranger, you have saved my daughter.</string>
  <string id="26621" soundid="145383">You have my gratitude forever for this. I know this must have cost you dearly. If ever I find a way to repay you, I will seek you out.</string>
  <string id="26622" soundid="145384">But now... this is not place to heal. My daughter is saved, but she is not well. I must take her to somewhere she can rest in peace, not surrounded by death.</string>
  <string id="26623" soundid="145385">Here is all that I have. Everything else was spent in pursuit of my dream. I thank you... *we* thank you from the bottom of our hearts.</string>
  <string id="26624" soundid="145824">So you fight with no knowledge of your enemy? That will be your undoing. I do not know your face, but I have studied what you have done here. I can defeat you!</string>
  <string id="26625" soundid="145387"></string>
  <string id="26626" soundid="145388"></string>
  <string id="26627" soundid="145389">Thank you for what you have done. I have been redeemed in my own eyes and in the eyes of heaven. Peace indeed *can* come to any soul.</string>
  <string id="26628" soundid="145825">Sagacious? Is that what you call yourself now? Hardly a worthy representation of the blood you spilled.</string>
  <string id="26629" soundid="145391">It&apos;s not right! It can&apos;t be possible that I... It&apos;s you! And this... this must be the doctor!</string>
  <string id="26630" soundid="145392">Please, madam, if you could help me, you would have my eternal gratitude! I am desperate, and I have no other recourse!</string>
  <string id="26631" soundid="145393">This girl. Such a strong, vibrant life energy in one so young... and so fragile. She is too young to have such a cruel fate.</string>
  <string id="26632" soundid="150702">Keep an eye out for a young man dressed in plain blues and greens. He is heavily armored from head to foot.</string>
  <string id="26633">Not right now.</string>
  <string id="26634" soundid="145396">Please... will you help my daughter? I will give you anything, all my research, just for you to save her. The liver... the liver would be my own. No one else would be harmed.</string>
  <string id="26635" soundid="145397">My skill in acupuncture can keep you alive through the operation, but.... you will not live long after. If you tell me how to proceed, I believe I can help her. </string>
  <string id="26636" soundid="145398">Doctor, my spirit will be indebted to you for all time. Si Wei... I love you... forever. Let us proceed, Doctor.</string>
  <string id="26637" soundid="145826">You do not know me, assassin.</string>
  <string id="26638" soundid="145827">Perhaps, but I know what you were. Not that it matters anymore.</string>
  <string id="26639" soundid="145401">It is done. The man&apos;s methods are... extreme, but very effective. As was his love for his daughter. A true parent would do anything to save his child. </string>
  <string id="26640" soundid="145402">She will live, provided she does not remain here. I will take her with me and care for her. If she wishes, I will teach her of her father&apos;s legacy. He would want that, I think.</string>
  <string id="26641" soundid="145403">Thank you for bringing me here, and giving me the chance to save them. I&apos;ll return to the Imperial Arena with her.</string>
  <string id="26642" soundid="145828">Is that what he calls himself now? Hardly an honest representation of the blood he spilled. It doesn&apos;t matter. No matter your allies, I cannot let you survive.</string>
  <string id="26644" soundid="31136">Should you emerge the victor of our fight, I will train you in some of my more advanced techniques. You have shown the purity of spirit to wield a weapon with the required precision.</string>
  <string id="26646" soundid="31138">I keep only what I need to survive from my winnings. The rest goes back to my school in the east. The training is all I can, or will, offer you. Now, what else do you need?</string>
  <string id="26647">Forget it, then. Let me go back to my questions.</string>
  <string id="26651" soundid="31143">Every city has its masters. I came here to compete against the Empire&apos;s best and I have managed to hold my own. Is there anyone else you wish to ask about?</string>
  <string id="26653" soundid="31145">It&apos;s hard to say with him. Perhaps his smile is that of the full and satisfied tiger. Not vacant, as the others believe. Is there anyone else you want to know about?</string>
  <string id="26654" soundid="31146">I believe so, yes. I do not really agree with such a philosophy, but it is worthy of respect, nonetheless. Is there anyone else you want to know about?</string>
  <string id="26655" soundid="31147">You have faced him; I leave you to your own judgments. Is there anyone else you want to know about?</string>
  <string id="26656" soundid="31148">You mock him, but I would reserve judgment until you face him. Is there anyone else you want to know about?</string>
  <string id="26658" soundid="31150">The Gate saw frequent use in the past but now Emperor Sun allows no one to pass through. Then again, he has flyers at his disposal, I suppose.</string>
  <string id="26660" soundid="31152">The Wall&apos;s defensive role has long since been eclipsed but it remains an ever-expanding monument to the Empire&apos;s strength. All land within it is the Emperor&apos;s own.</string>
  <string id="26663" soundid="31155">Of course.</string>
  <string id="26668" soundid="31160">Leave me. I will not waste more time with you.</string>
  <string id="26669" soundid="31161">Thank you again for your warning. It will be good to know that our fight will be fair.</string>
  <string id="26672">What will you do now?</string>
  <string id="26673">Running away from your defeat?</string>
  <string id="26680">Why wouldn&apos;t you exploit that opening?</string>
  <string id="26682">My training was flawless. You must be mistaken.</string>
  <string id="26684">I&apos;ll not take commentary on my skills from one as weak as you!</string>
  <string id="26687" soundid="105608">Many of you are asking yourselves why the Serpent would return to the ring. Am I not retired? Yes! But does that mean I do not care about your entertainment? No!</string>
  <string id="26688" soundid="105609">You&apos;ve all seen the fury and the intense focus of Raging Dragon in the ring! Now, it&apos;s time to put those abilities to the test!</string>
  <string id="26689" soundid="105610">We&apos;ve all seen the flawless technique of the soaring star that is Silver Phoenix. Now, it is time to put these aptly demonstrated skills to the test!</string>
  <string id="26690" soundid="105611">Tiger Lifts the Mountain has climbed the ranks with great power and deliberation. Who wants to see what this fighter can really do?</string>
  <string id="26691" soundid="105612">And so, the Serpent gives you a real spectacle! Have your silver handy to place your wagers! I give you evil and terror incarnate!</string>
  <string id="26696">I should warn you: Lucky Cho is trying to eliminate you.</string>
  <string id="26697">Lucky Cho offered me the services of a poisoner.</string>
  <string id="26698">I consider you a worthy opponent. I want to make sure our match is honest.</string>
  <string id="26699">We have to watch each other&apos;s backs, or the Guild will fix every fight.</string>
  <string id="26701">Because I expect a reward from you, and a generous one at that.</string>
  <string id="26704">That is a fine reward. Thank you.</string>
  <string id="26705" soundid="105621">You earned it. Eliminating the General couldn&apos;t have been easy. He was getting on in years, but was never an easy opponent.</string>
  <string id="26706">That&apos;s it? Training only if I defeat you? I was expecting silver.</string>
  <string id="26709" soundid="62629">Life in a small town on the edge of the Empire can be hard, and many people die untimely deaths. What more needs be said on the subject?</string>
  <string id="26712">Why have you come here, specifically?</string>
  <string id="26713">Are there many different styles taught in the Prosperous East?</string>
  <string id="26715">You think he throws fights?</string>
  <string id="26717">He values learning more than victory, then?</string>
  <string id="26719">That&apos;s pathetic. He deserves to be called Hapless, then.</string>
  <string id="26722">Is there any way through the Emperor&apos;s Gate?</string>
  <string id="26724">Do you know any of the history of the Wall?</string>
  <string id="26727">Let me ask about another area of the city.</string>
  <string id="26731" soundid="108709">Ya Zhen: Your role is of great importance indeed. Mortals are never returned to life in their own form.</string>
  <string id="26732" soundid="105622">And here, take this. Li-Li collected for us. I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll be happy with the sum. I&apos;m ready to leave whenever I get bored.</string>
  <string id="26733" soundid="144871">Even so, I did my best. I made you strong enough to achieve your destiny, but with a weakness I could exploit. I thought I anticipated everything, but you proved me wrong.</string>
  <string id="26734">Dong Ping</string>
  <string id="26737">Zhong</string>
  <string id="26742">Henpecked Hou</string>
  <string id="26745" soundid="151584"></string>
  <string id="26746" soundid="151585">This has been... troubling. We should return to the flyer as soon as possible so everyone can discuss what we have learned.</string>
  <string id="26747" soundid="151586">I don&apos;t like what we have seen here. We must return to your flyer so everyone can discuss what we have learned.</string>
  <string id="26748" soundid="151587">A regrettable adventure. We should return to the flyer so everyone can discuss what we have learned.</string>
  <string id="26749" soundid="151588">This has been very troubling. We must return to the flyer so we can discuss these strange events with everyone present.</string>
  <string id="26750" soundid="151589">This has been a confusing evening. We should go back to the flyer to unload this information on someone more concerned with it... and for wine.</string>
  <string id="26751" soundid="151590">Chai Ka: We are closer to the heart of the enemy. The others will want to know about this. We should return to the flyer.</string>
  <string id="26753" soundid="151592">The Soul Extractor certainly kills whatever is placed within it, but little is left of the victim, so you cannot prove they did not belong there. Only a spirit shard remains.</string>
  <string id="26754" soundid="151593">The golem press is far more dangerous, but I have nothing to do with that ungainly device. I prefer the elegance of ripping slaves apart.</string>
  <string id="26755">The machine looks dangerous. Have accidents claimed any lives?</string>
  <string id="26758" soundid="153200">What slave traders would that be? I&apos;ve never heard of anybody trading slaves around here.</string>
  <string id="26760">Lotus Assassin</string>
  <string id="26764">Mummy</string>
  <string id="26768">Mummy</string>
  <string id="26772" soundid="151611">All right, this is as far as I&apos;m going. I&apos;m a guide, not a soldier.</string>
  <string id="26773" soundid="151612">Your allies are fighting already. You better join them. I don&apos;t need any of these outlaws reaching me.</string>
  <string id="26774" soundid="151613"></string>
  <string id="26777" soundid="161266">We will need our weapons before we can properly deal with the bandits. We should see Gujin as quickly as we can.</string>
  <string id="26782" soundid="151621">Hey... you! What do you think you&apos;re doing here? Get out of here, or we&apos;ll throw you out.</string>
  <string id="26783" soundid="151622">Ha! You sound like my weakling friend over here. &quot;Please let me pass.&quot; No!</string>
  <string id="26784" soundid="151623">I&apos;m not the one in trouble here. *We* outnumber *you*... in case you haven&apos;t noticed.</string>
  <string id="26785" soundid="151624">Ha! Not bad, you&apos;ve got some spirit, but it&apos;ll take more than that to get past us.</string>
  <string id="26786" soundid="151625">Now, how about you just turn yourself around before you get hurt.</string>
  <string id="26787" soundid="151626">You don&apos;t hear so well, do you? Maybe we&apos;ll just have to *show* you what we mean!</string>
  <string id="26788" soundid="151627">Boys! We may be young, but we&apos;ve trained all our lives.</string>
  <string id="26789" soundid="151628">Only a fool looks forward to a beating! Ha!</string>
  <string id="26790" soundid="151629">C&apos;mon... let&apos;s teach our visitor some respect!</string>
  <string id="26791">I&apos;m just visiting. Please let me pass.</string>
  <string id="26793">Careful what you say. It might get you into trouble.</string>
  <string id="26795">Just try it. It&apos;ll be the last thing you do!</string>
  <string id="26797">How about you let me pass!</string>
  <string id="26799">Get out of my way, boys!</string>
  <string id="26801">I&apos;m looking forward to this. Let&apos;s go!</string>
  <string id="26803" soundid="151671">You gain the envious ability to buy and sell at your whim. And I... I can prove my worth in my new role. Perhaps I will even do well enough to get promoted.</string>
  <string id="26804" soundid="151672">Well, that is a most excellent way to think about it.</string>
  <string id="26806" soundid="151673">Simply call upon me as you would any of your followers, and I&apos;ll be there. In the meantime, I have much to do.</string>
  <string id="26807" soundid="151674">As you wish. I have much work to do myself.</string>
  <string id="26808" soundid="151675">I&apos;m afraid my supplies are a little low at the moment. But fear not, I will acquire new items as quickly as I can. I should go and see what I can dig up for you.</string>
  <string id="26809" soundid="151676">Don&apos;t worry, I&apos;ll be around. Just call on me if you need something. Good day!</string>
  <string id="26811">Who are you?</string>
  <string id="26814">Great. I could use someone of your skill.</string>
  <string id="26824">Ya Zhen</string>
  <string id="26829" soundid="132378">Thank you, oh great and noble friend! Minister Sheng weeps with relief to hear such news! I have no doubt you will take care of this in a quick and efficient fashion.</string>
  <string id="26830" soundid="132379">Kill me? But... but why? What has poor Minister Sheng ever done to you that you would want to spill his precious blood?</string>
  <string id="26841" soundid="132380">Help! Guards! Minister Sheng is in trouble! Help! Help!</string>

  <string id="26879">Not hurt?</string>
  <string id="26880">The Drowned Orphans</string>
  <string id="26882" soundid="42802">Hello! Greetings! Welcome! My name is Steeper Yanru and I&apos;ll be.... No! That&apos;s not right! Not right at all! Idiot! I&apos;m Barkeep Yanru now, not Steeper Yanru. </string>
  <string id="26883" soundid="42803">I&apos;m sorry about that. I still can&apos;t get the hang of this new position. Sometimes I wish Old Mother Kwan still owned the teahouse so things could go back to the way they were.</string>
  <string id="26885">Pedestal</string>
  <string id="26887" soundid="42807">Slow down, my friend! I can&apos;t serve you wine yet; I&apos;m not a real barkeep. Master Dutong just has me practicing so I&apos;ll be ready when he turns this place from a teahouse into a tavern.</string>
  <string id="26888" soundid="42808">Master Dutong wants me to practice giving out advice for now. He wants me to stay focused until I get the hang of it. No wine--except for him, of course. You want some advice? </string>
  <string id="26906" soundid="115744">No, it wouldn&apos;t have. But these days I live a sad, pathetic existence. Would things be any worse if I was a ghost in the ruins?</string>
  <string id="26907" soundid="115745">Your disgust is nothing compared to my own self-loathing. Sometimes I wonder if I would be better off as a spirit wandering the ruins instead of the broken shell I am now.</string>
  <string id="26912" soundid="42826">Hello again! A salutorious greeting and welcome! I&apos;m going to be the best barkeep in Tien&apos;s Landing, as soon as Three Sheets Dutong turns this place into a tavern.</string>
  <string id="26913" soundid="42827">I would rather have kept my old job, but Dutong&apos;s in charge now. He says I have to practice giving out wine and advice so I can become a real barkeep, just like the ones in the Imperial City.</string>
  <string id="26914" soundid="115746">Nothing. It&apos;s not important. Not anymore.</string>
  <string id="26915" soundid="115747">Why are you bothering me? I&apos;ve done nothing to you. I&apos;m just a tired old man trying to drink his tea.</string>
  <string id="26916">Fine, I&apos;ll go.</string>
  <string id="26917">Throwing your own life away wouldn&apos;t have saved them.</string>
  <string id="26922" soundid="42836">Dutong gets very friendly when he starts to drink. You might get a confession out of him then, but I doubt it. He&apos;s not really all that drunk at that stage.</string>
  <string id="26923" soundid="42837">Usually after about seven bowls, he slips into depression and sorrow. He complains about how his life is worthless and what a bad and sinful man he is. Not a pretty sight.</string>
  <string id="26924" soundid="42838">By the ninth glass he starts to get paranoid. You can&apos;t really talk to him then. Usually around that time I try to slip a restorative potion into his glass to sober him up.</string>
  <string id="26926">Golem</string>
  <string id="26937" soundid="42851">No problem. We have two sorts of wine here: peasants&apos; wine and Imperial seasoned spirits. The peasants&apos; wine is pretty weak, but that&apos;s usually what Dutong drinks. </string>
  <string id="26938" soundid="42852">The Imperial seasoned spirits are a lot stronger. One bowl of that is worth three bowls of peasants&apos; wine. And if Dutong gets too drunk, I have the restorative to sober him up.</string>
  <string id="26939" soundid="42853">One drink for Master Dutong, coming up. Anything else I can do for you?</string>
  <string id="26943" soundid="42857">Sure thing. He doesn&apos;t like taking it, but I&apos;ll just slip it into a glass. He&apos;ll drink it and be sober as a judge in no time. Anything else I can do for you?</string>
  <string id="26948" soundid="42862">Sure. Just remember, I&apos;m pretty new at this. I&apos;m still practicing. Let&apos;s try this one: Every bureaucrat knows a tree grows toward the light--but a rock grows not at all. </string>
  <string id="26949" soundid="42863">The wise man will always remember that falling leaves spiral downwards, but only until they rest on the earth. </string>
  <string id="26950" soundid="42864">I kind of like this next one: If you drop a rock in a well, you&apos;ll hear a splash--but if you drop a feather in a fire, you&apos;ll hear something very different.</string>
  <string id="26951" soundid="42865">Here&apos;s a short one: If you must sleep on the same bed, at least try to dream different dreams.</string>
  <string id="26952" soundid="42866">When one&apos;s foot knows what one&apos;s hand is doing, one is dangerous; but if the belly button has not been consulted, havoc will ensue.</string>
  <string id="26953" soundid="42867">I have no idea. Dutong just had me memorize a bunch of wise sayings. None of them make much sense to me. Maybe they&apos;ll sound better if people drink the wine.</string>
  <string id="26954" soundid="42868">Just remember what I told you. You never know when a bit of homespun wisdom will come in handy.</string>
  <string id="26955" soundid="42869">Sorry, but Dutong only had me memorize five sayings. You bled me dry earlier. I have no more advice left. Is there anything else you need?</string>

  <string id="27053">How does this work... exactly?</string>
  <string id="27055">Whatever you say. Can I go now?</string>
  <string id="27058">What are you talking about?</string>
  <string id="27059">Get out of my way!</string>
  <string id="27062">What? Why would you need to do that?</string>
  <string id="27063">I still have no idea what you&apos;re talking about.</string>
  <string id="27065">So don&apos;t do it! It won&apos;t bother me one bit.</string>
  <string id="27070">It sounds like a very difficult job.</string>
  <string id="27071">I&apos;m sorry if this has caused you trouble, but I do what I must.</string>
  <string id="27072">Get out of my way or I&apos;ll move you!</string>
  <string id="27074">I don&apos;t have time for this, Zin Bu!</string>
  <string id="27077">What do you need me for?</string>
  <string id="27079">So, how does that help you?</string>
  <string id="27080">So, I have to sell you something now?</string>
  <string id="27082">Zin Bu the Magical Abacus</string>
  <string id="27086" soundid="151716">There wasn&apos;t much of it left when I left. The place was empty, and no one in their right mind would return.</string>
  <string id="27087">Why did you leave Broken Path?</string>
  <string id="27092" soundid="108674">Though you did earn a few points by making her storm out of here for good. All that talk of honor was taking the fun out of crushing my foes.</string>
  <string id="27093">What is the difference? The person dies each time.</string>
  <string id="27095">[Leave.]</string>
  <string id="27098" soundid="31648">That was such an exciting event. All the fighting, the crowd cheering.... I almost got distracted.</string>
  <string id="27099" soundid="31649">Well, I did get distracted, and that wasn&apos;t so good, but it was fun, and I learned a lot from it.</string>
  <string id="27103" soundid="139510">All we really know, is that Second Brother is missing. Master Smiling Hawk sent him on an errand,  but no one has seen him since.</string>
  <string id="27105" soundid="139511">It is unlike Second Brother to be gone this long without contacting us. I suspect that something has happened to him.</string>
  <string id="27108" soundid="139512">We have students looking for him now. I hope we find him soon. He is a good man... and an excellent brother.</string>
  <string id="27110" soundid="139513">It&apos;s named after Master Black Leopard, the school&apos;s first true master. He founded the school in a remote region of the Empire hundreds of years ago.</string>
  <string id="27113" soundid="139514">The school grew slowly but steadily under Master Black Leopard&apos;s tutelage, but it wasn&apos;t until he was quite old that the school became as popular as it is today.</string>

  <string id="27192" soundid="126762">Do you mind? I am in no mood for company, given my present state of despondency.</string>
  <string id="27193" soundid="126763">I confess that I am eager to find a woman of genuine intellect and class; however, I have long given up hope of finding such a bride in this all too provincial town.</string>
  <string id="27194" soundid="126764">My name is Yaoru, though some of the locals disparagingly refer to me as Yaoru the Sailor. You see, I am predisposed to seasickness, ergo I despise the water.</string>
  <string id="27195" soundid="126765">Yet I suffer their verbal slings and arrows with nary a complaint; it is just one more misfortune to pile atop the great heap that buries me in misery.</string>
  <string id="27196" soundid="126766">I am at the stage of my life in which I long for companionship, a wife with intellect and refinement comparable, but just slightly inferior, to my own.</string>
  <string id="27197" soundid="126767">Unfortunately, this town presents scant opportunity for a suitable match. Seamstresses, barmaids, peasants... I may as well marry the harlots selling themselves in the street!</string>
  <string id="27198" soundid="126768">Ai Ling? Surely you jest! The infamy of that woman&apos;s gang leads me to believe she is barely above a beast... though I hear she is fair to gaze upon.</string>

  <string id="27207" soundid="126777">Harsh words will not sway my opinion of Ai Ling; in fact, your attitude merely confirms my belief that she would make a most unfit bride.</string>
  <string id="27209" soundid="126778">Gladly... though I fear even the potentiality of such a match will now leave a permanent scar upon my already tortured mind.</string>
  <string id="27210" soundid="126779">Or perhaps everyone else&apos;s standards are far too low! I shall not allow myself to be saddled with a marriage of convenience; not when I deserve so much more.</string>

  <string id="27271" soundid="31859">Though Han seems less cheerful these days than before. I hope his illusions haven&apos;t finally been shattered.</string>
  <string id="27272" soundid="31860">I&apos;m sure he will bounce back as fresh as ever, though. He always does.</string>
  <string id="27281" soundid="108291">Princess... no, you pretend about too much to be genuine in this. Honest affection comes from years of growth.</string>

  <string id="27286" soundid="108293">Ah, but that is not always an option. Sometimes there are difficult choices that must be made.</string>
  <string id="27287" soundid="106853">General Kao has defeated more men in single duels than there are ways to ruin a cake. I&apos;d be careful.</string>
  <string id="27292" soundid="31899">Yes, yes. Minister Sheng is most appreciative. Now if you&apos;ll excuse me, I must plan my triumphant return to the Imperial City!</string>
  <string id="27293" soundid="31900">Ha! It is hard to argue with success! My lord, Judge Fang, Chief Minister of Harmony, will surely be impressed with me. He will protect me from the vile Assassins!</string>
  <string id="27294" soundid="31901">No. Or I should say, not another! You have the thanks of the Ministry, and I do believe the good Captain Ing already sent a runner with his thanks.</string>

  <string id="27302" soundid="31909">Put that sword back, lout! Surely there was never a minister as unlucky as Minister Sheng, to suffer such insolence!</string>
  <string id="27303" soundid="31910"></string>
  <string id="27304" soundid="31911">Is that it? You&apos;re just going to let the thief walk free?</string>
  <string id="27305" soundid="31912">And still poor Minister Sheng suffers the insults of tradesmen who know nothing of justice! Where would I put the lout?</string>
  <string id="27306" soundid="31913">My jail has been burned to the ground. Along with my office, I might add. I have no place to put thieves! So stop questioning your betters!</string>

  <string id="27309" soundid="31916">It is not easy to be Minister Sheng! Beset with troubles and doom, and now interrupted by some difficult stranger!</string>
  <string id="27310" soundid="31917">Truly, can you not see that I am busy watching my career slide into oblivion? Minister Sheng simply hasn&apos;t time for your petty concerns! I have problems of my own!</string>
  <string id="27311" soundid="31918">The Ministry of Harmony, which oversees taxation and execution, usually in that order. But poor Minister Sheng oversees nothing in this dying town! Nothing but failure!</string>
  <string id="27314" soundid="31921">You what? Insolence! My career is on the line, and you want to talk about something else? Look about you!</string>
  <string id="27315" soundid="31922">This backwater pimple of a town lives off of the lake created by the Great Dam. But the Great Dam is open and the lake is dry. The town is dying... under my supervision!</string>
  <string id="27316" soundid="83234">I thank you, and my Fen will thank you when she is returned to me.</string>
  <string id="27317" soundid="31924">Not by me. I cannot act against that horrible Assassin Lim, who opened the Great Dam! I&apos;m not supposed to even say his name, but I am desperate for a solution.</string>
  <string id="27318" soundid="31925">Who cares about that? The Great Dam was opened by... no, I cannot say. It is too dangerous. Unless... very well, you&apos;ve convinced me. It was that horrible Inquisitor Lim!</string>
  <string id="27319" soundid="31926">I didn&apos;t want the town to panic, so I kept Lim&apos;s presence here a secret. Better the peasants think it was ghosts... a much less terrifying idea.</string>
  <string id="27321">Nobody else seems to know about the Assassins.</string>
  <string id="27322" soundid="31929">I am sure you do. But first you will hear my cries of pain! You must help Minister Sheng!</string>
  <string id="27323" soundid="31930">Think of the people of the town! All the little children and nice merchants, slowly dying. Old ones in the street, gasping their last. Minister Sheng needs your help!</string>
  <string id="27324" soundid="31931">Some brave soul must travel through the old ruins, which are absolutely not infested with ghosts, and close the Great Dam. The gate to the ruins is locked, but I have a key.</string>
  <string id="27325" soundid="31932">I cannot order, or even ask, someone to go do this! If the Great Dam closes, the ruins will flood! Various Assassins and soldiers will be killed! Not good for my career.</string>
  <string id="27326" soundid="83235">My precious Flower of the Fields. I can&apos;t leave without her.</string>
  <string id="27327" soundid="31934">But if I happened to *lose* the key and someone happened to *find* it... the town could be saved and the problem solved without any sanction from me!</string>
  <string id="27328" soundid="31935">Think about what? I don&apos;t know what you&apos;re talking about. So, stranger, is there anything else Minister Sheng can do for you?</string>
  <string id="27329" soundid="31936">What are you talking about? I haven&apos;t given you anything. Although, I will need that back when you&apos;re done.</string>
  <string id="27330" soundid="31937">I&apos;ve barely said two words to you, and certainly nothing about closing the Great Dam. You can never claim I said anything about that!</string>
  <string id="27331" soundid="31938">Not from me, certainly, because I never asked you to do anything. Right? Now I happen to know of a ship&apos;s captain down on the waterfront--Ing, I think--who is trapped here.</string>
  <string id="27332" soundid="31939">He has a big cargo rotting in his hold. I am sure he would pay a good sum to anyone who could close the Great Dam.</string>
  <string id="27333" soundid="31940">And again you bother me! Is there no end? Did you find the controls to the Great Dam? You must close the Great Dam. Not that I said anything about that, of course.</string>
  <string id="27334" soundid="31941">You haven&apos;t gotten to it? Have you been busy seeing the sights of this lovely town? Wandering the serene countryside? Visiting relatives?</string>
  <string id="27335" soundid="31942">The dam is closed, and the town is saved, so Minister Sheng feels magnanimous. That means I will answer your questions, by the way.</string>
  <string id="27336" soundid="31943">Oh do you? Then ask, by all means. My life and troubles can simply wait while you satisfy your curiosity!</string>
  <string id="27337" soundid="31944">My career is in tatters. My life is over. But you have questions, so we&apos;d better deal with that!</string>
  <string id="27338" soundid="31945">Well, I think that is wonderful. Let&apos;s sit and chat while the sky falls all around us... along with my career!</string>
  <string id="27339" soundid="31946">Ah, my favorite subject! Ask and Sheng, Imperial Minister of Harmony for this entire region, will let you bask in the glory that is... me!</string>
  <string id="27341">I need some directions.</string>
  <string id="27342" soundid="31949">Don&apos;t... Why... How dare... yes. You are right. I am minister of this bleeding puss-pool of a town. And yes, it is because I am in disfavor. Are you through?</string>
  <string id="27343" soundid="31950">Very well. I still feel some slight affection for your earlier service to me. Ask and Minister Sheng shall answer.</string>
  <string id="27344" soundid="31951">Excellent. Truly good news! I haven&apos;t anything else to do. I&apos;m still hours away from committing suicide.</string>
  <string id="27345" soundid="31952">Minister Sheng needs doers, not askers! What has happened to the helpful-but-silent peasant that was once a staple of the Empire?</string>
  <string id="27346" soundid="31953">I once lived in the Imperial City! I was almost a regular at court! Now Minister Sheng is reduced to answering questions in the street.</string>
  <string id="27347" soundid="112474">You&apos;ve got style, girl. You&apos;re just fine in my book, as long as your purse is full.</string>
  <string id="27348" soundid="31955">Woe to Sheng, that his sole ally is an uneducated simpleton! The Ministry of Harmony oversees taxes and executions for this entire region.</string>
  <string id="27349" soundid="31956">Judge Fang, the Chief Minister of Harmony! He didn&apos;t want me anywhere near the seat of power! He sent me here--an exile as unjust as any in the history of the Empire!</string>
  <string id="27350" soundid="31957">Jealousy! You see, by the rosters of the Imperial bureaucracy, I am next in line for Fang&apos;s job. It was only a matter of time until Minister Sheng ascended to his position!</string>
  <string id="27351" soundid="112475">You&apos;re not half bad, for a man. You&apos;re in my good books as long as you have the silver to stay there.</string>
  <string id="27352" soundid="31959">Fang does not think much of me, so he banished me to this remote branch of the Ministry of Harmony. Now one of his lackeys will take my rightful position as his successor!</string>
  <string id="27353" soundid="31960">The shame! When the Great Dam opened and the lake drained, a ship was trapped in port, and the sailors got quite rowdy.</string>
  <string id="27354" soundid="31961">They got drunk and set fire to the Ministry of Harmony&apos;s office. That is the ruin of it over there. Fortunately, since the Great Dam has been closed, the sailors are gone!</string>
  <string id="27355" soundid="31962">The shame! Since the Great Dam opened and the lake drained, there has been a ship trapped in port, and the sailors are growing increasingly rowdy.</string>
  <string id="27356" soundid="31963">Some of them got drunk and set fire to the Ministry of Harmony&apos;s office. That is the ruin of it over there.</string>
  <string id="27357" soundid="31964">What can be done? The sailors want to leave as badly as the town wants them gone. But until the dam is closed, their ship isn&apos;t going anywhere.</string>
  <string id="27358" soundid="31965">I&apos;m sure Captain Ing down by the pier would offer you some sort of reward to close the Great Dam and free his ship. That is what we in the Ministry of Harmony call a hint.</string>

  <string id="27381" soundid="83238">Please, I am grateful for whatever you can do. My Flower of the Fields. I can&apos;t leave without her.</string>
  <string id="27382">Whether or not you get any of my silver depends on what you have for sale.</string>
  <string id="27385" soundid="31992">Oh, please. Ask away. Minister Sheng--that&apos;s Imperial Minister Sheng of the Ministry of Harmony--has nothing better to do than act as your guide to local customs!</string>
  <string id="27386">Where do you find your wares?</string>
  <string id="27387">Are these goods stolen?</string>
  <string id="27388">Spear Catches Leaf</string>
  <string id="27389" soundid="31996">It is true, I am knowledgeable and well-traveled. Very well, let me elucidate.</string>
  <string id="27390" soundid="31997">But I respect him! Oh yes, I respect him so very, very much.</string>
  <string id="27391">Do you ever worry about this much magic in one place?</string>
  <string id="27392" soundid="31999">Ru announced three days ago that he was going to close the Great Dam, but first he stopped at the teahouse for a bowl of wine. As far as I know, he is still there.</string>
  <string id="27394" soundid="32001">I believe I saw him down by his barge, on Beggar&apos;s Pier. You can probably find him there. Just follow the smell of wine.</string>
  <string id="27395" soundid="83239">You have not felt her charms upon your soul. Fine, be on your way, but please... if you see my Fen, my Flower of the Fields, get her away from those bandit mongrels.</string>
  <string id="27396" soundid="32003">Minister Sheng remembers when flyers were reserved for the wealthy elite of the Imperial City. Now pirates use them to raid the countryside. Disgraceful!</string>
  <string id="27397" soundid="83240">They&apos;ll work her to death, I know it. Or eat her... or worse. I can&apos;t leave this place without her.</string>
  <string id="27398" soundid="112543">The man to see is named Qui the Promoter. He knows everything there is to know about this place.</string>
  <string id="27399" soundid="32006">I recently saw a large fleet of flyers pass by. Minister Sheng held out hope that they had come to escort him away from this demeaning post and back to the Imperial City.</string>
  <string id="27400" soundid="112544">Might even be looking for a new body to fill out the roster. This could be your chance. If you&apos;re interested, he&apos;s usually up in his office. Up and around to the back.</string>
  <string id="27401" soundid="112545">Of course, champion! Always an honor to have your patronage.</string>
  <string id="27402" soundid="32009">But the flyers never stopped in Tien&apos;s Landing. They headed upriver, toward the pirates&apos; camp. No doubt they went there to refuel, though where they are now, I could not say.</string>
  <string id="27403" soundid="112546">Stop by again! Miniature Ravager hoods for the kids are coming in any day now. You know you&apos;ll want two!</string>
  <string id="27404" soundid="112547">Come back again soon! </string>
  <string id="27406" soundid="32013">Exactly! Because I never actually asked you to help, right? Very good. Now go close the Great Dam. Quickly!</string>
  <string id="27407" soundid="32014">Yes, yes. Go and leave Minister Sheng alone to ponder his troubles. Now go close the Great Dam, and I never said that!</string>
  <string id="27408" soundid="32015">Yes, yes, go on your way. There is no hope anyway. The dam is destroyed and Minister Sheng is cursed! Woe!</string>
  <string id="27409" soundid="32016">Very well, run along! Now that the dam is closed again, Minister Sheng is on his way back to the Imperial City, I&apos;m sure of it!</string>
  <string id="27410" soundid="158473">Quit crying, fool, or we will gut you like a carp.</string>
  <string id="27411" soundid="83242">These reeds hide so many thieves... you could walk right past a camp and not see it. There&apos;s no telling where they took your friend, or my Fen.</string>
  <string id="27412" soundid="83243">My precious Fen. I hope these bandit thugs are merciful with her.</string>
  <string id="27413" soundid="83244">These marshes are not kind to gentle creatures.</string>
  <string id="27414" soundid="83245">She has a strong spirit, but there is only so much of a burden a heart can carry.</string>
  <string id="27415" soundid="108294">Yes, much like the danger we must choose to face, and deciding... whose heart you think of to get you through such times.</string>
  <string id="27416" soundid="108295">[Success] Well, of course you want to keep everyone together. How else are we to function as a team? I cannot fault you for trying to be an effective diplomat.</string>
  <string id="27417" soundid="108296">That&apos;s not what this is about. I was looking for a more personal assurance of... something.</string>
  <string id="27418" soundid="108297">[Success] I... am not certain what this means, but I am sufficiently intrigued to let it pass for now.</string>
  <string id="27419" soundid="108298">You phrase things is such a way that I feel I am equal with a princess. That brings me comfort, even if the rest of this is a bit confusing.</string>
  <string id="27420" soundid="108299">I imagine it would be, little Dawn Star. We shall have to see if anything comes of it.</string>
  <string id="27421" soundid="108300">For now, I believe we are done here. Take care within the Assassins&apos; fortress. To save your master, you must expose Death&apos;s Hand.</string>
  <string id="27422" soundid="154006">Ah, I know you. You are the new acolyte, and you have already brought change. I am the Keeper of the Archive, and I was about to write a new entry.</string>
  <string id="27423" soundid="108301">And when you have succeeded, the three of us can expand on what you have suggested.</string>
  <string id="27424" soundid="100598">Do you have any idea how much paperwork I have to do when a contestant of the Empire&apos;s finest tournament dies?</string>
  <string id="27425" soundid="100599">Wards and spells have protected fighters in this place since its construction. It&apos;s been easily twenty years since they failed.</string>
  <string id="27428" soundid="139516">Very little, I&apos;m afraid. The school enjoys a degree of privacy from the outside world. It allows us to focus on our training, but it also isolates us.</string>
  <string id="27430" soundid="139517">I haven&apos;t been beyond these walls in almost five years. There is really nothing for me in the world beyond. My focus is the school and its students.</string>

  <string id="27436" soundid="100601">It was a dark day. My predecessor lost several good men when the spells failed during an event he&apos;d ironically dubbed the Feast of the Ogres.</string>
  <string id="27437" soundid="100602">I&apos;m no sorcerer, but I suppose it could happen. Still, any magically inclined person would notice something like that.</string>
  <string id="27438" soundid="100603">Even if someone removed them, the protections would re-weave themselves automatically in time. They&apos;ve done so before.</string>

  <string id="27440" soundid="154007">Here ended the rule of Shin, a petty man who fell to the wiles of those he subjugated. He will be replaced by Master Gang and.... </string>
  <string id="27441" soundid="100606">That&apos;s the spirit of the thing! Now, what name proceeds you in your travels?</string>
  <string id="27442" soundid="100607">Ah... right. A fine name... a fine name indeed.</string>
  <string id="27443" soundid="100608">But it won&apos;t sell. Not at all. We need something more memorable for the crowds.</string>
  <string id="27444" soundid="100609">Have a bit of a past that you&apos;d rather not catch up with you? You&apos;re not the first!</string>
  <string id="27445" soundid="100610">I&apos;ve heard that one before. Have you any idea how many bored students peramputate down here from the Scholars&apos; Garden?</string>
  <string id="27446" soundid="100611">Think of something that would sound engaging ringing from the rafters. That&apos;s how we&apos;ll bill you!</string>
  <string id="27447" soundid="100612">Raging Dragon, huh? Sounds fast and powerful. I like it. Are you positive that&apos;s what you want?</string>
  <string id="27448" soundid="100613">Silver Phoenix.... Silver Phoenix. Conjures up quite an image. Are you certain?</string>
  <string id="27449" soundid="100614">Now that&apos;s a decisive name. Tiger Lifts the Mountain it is, if you&apos;re certain?</string>
  <string id="27450" soundid="100615">Then that is what you shall have. Come and tell me when you&apos;re ready for a fight, and I&apos;ll get you started.</string>
  <string id="27451" soundid="100616">Don&apos;t worry if you have to take off for a while; we&apos;ll work around your schedule. Don&apos;t forget about us, though, or we might forget about you.</string>
  <string id="27452" soundid="100617">Since you&apos;re new, you&apos;ll start in the qualifying rounds. The money&apos;s small at that level, but it&apos;s there. Any other questions?</string>
  <string id="27453" soundid="100618">One other thing. You should talk to the other fighters now and then. They will be watching you, and you should get to know them, as well.</string>
  <string id="27454" soundid="100619">We&apos;re all one big happy family!</string>
  <string id="27455" soundid="100620">You&apos;re a big, happy idiot, Han!</string>
  <string id="27456" soundid="100621">As you can see, they always have something to say.</string>
  <string id="27457" soundid="100622">Take your time; you have to be happy with it.</string>

  <string id="27459" soundid="100624">Truly this is a loss for all involved. The offer stands as surely as the Wall itself, when your senses restore to their proper balance.</string>
  <string id="27460" soundid="100625">As sure as a dog will scratch where the flea bites, I knew you would return. Fighting&apos;s in your blood, and you&apos;ll itch until you test yourself in this grand contest!</string>
  <string id="27461" soundid="100626">Look at our Bronze Division champion, Crimson Khana. I can see that the two of you could be battle sisters: the way you stand, the steel in your eyes.</string>
  <string id="27462" soundid="100627">Testing yourself against the finest in the Empire: what else could a young man dream of?</string>
  <string id="27463" soundid="100628"></string>
  <string id="27464" soundid="100629">That was an impressive beginning. Normally I&apos;d have started you off against something easier, but you practically ooze potential!</string>
  <string id="27465" soundid="100630">You&apos;ve caught the eyes of the other fighters, as well. Go ask them if you don&apos;t believe me.</string>
  <string id="27466" soundid="100631">That really was a fantastic bout!</string>
  <string id="27467" soundid="100632">Beating the ogre&apos;s nothing special. I could have done better bound and blinded!</string>
  <string id="27471" soundid="100633">Sometimes you don&apos;t even need to ask.</string>
  <string id="27472" soundid="100634">One fight does not make a champion, though! There are many more opponents ahead of you. Let&apos;s move on, shall we?</string>
  <string id="27475">If you must.</string>
  <string id="27478">No.</string>
  <string id="27479">Won&apos;t the Lotus Assassins be mad at you?</string>
  <string id="27494">What are you minister of?</string>
  <string id="27497">This route is plagued with enemy ships. What do you want to do?</string>
  <string id="27499">What kind of problems do you have?</string>
  <string id="27500">I need to ask you some questions.</string>
  <string id="27502">Why is the Great Dam open?</string>
  <string id="27504">Is there anything that can be done?</string>
  <string id="27506">I&apos;m searching for a fleet of flyers. </string>
  <string id="27508">Why do you run your shop back here?</string>
  <string id="27509">Is there anything I can do?</string>
  <string id="27511">Do you have any idea why these restrictions are in place?</string>
  <string id="27512">I want to ask you about something else.</string>
  <string id="27514">This doesn&apos;t concern me.</string>
  <string id="27517">Slow down. Tell me what happened.</string>
  <string id="27519">Interesting. I&apos;ll think about it.</string>
  <string id="27520">Hey! What did you just give me? Is that a key?</string>
  <string id="27521">If you&apos;re done babbling, I have some questions for you.</string>
  <string id="27522">Is there a reward for doing this?</string>
  <string id="27524">I haven&apos;t gotten to it yet.</string>
  <string id="27525">I have some questions for you.</string>
  <string id="27526">I&apos;m curious about you.</string>
  <string id="27530">If I see her, I will do what I can.</string>
  <string id="27532">It couldn&apos;t just be that your goods are stolen?</string>
  <string id="27533">Doesn&apos;t &quot;this entire region&quot; just consist of this town?</string>
  <string id="27534">I want to ask about something else.</string>
  <string id="27536">What does the Ministry of Harmony do?</string>
  <string id="27537">Why were you sent to Tien&apos;s Landing?</string>
  <string id="27538">But why did he do that?</string>
  <string id="27540">Show me what you have to sell.</string>
  <string id="27541">Why are you standing here in front of a cart?</string>
  <string id="27544">Someone should do something about those sailors.</string>
  <string id="27546">I have questions about closing the Great Dam.</string>
  <string id="27547">Goodbye.</string>
  <string id="27548">Sailor</string>

  <string id="27570" soundid="112562">I have plenty of other items that might just fit, though! Why don&apos;t you have a look?</string>
  <string id="27571">I want to ask you about the Empire.</string>
  <string id="27574">Where can I find Ru the Boatswain?</string>
  <string id="27578">Your concerns do not interest me. Move aside.</string>
  <string id="27579">Let&apos;s take a look at your wares.</string>
  <string id="27580">Has a fleet of flyers passed by recently?</string>
  <string id="27583">Do you have anything I might be interested in?</string>
  <string id="27584">How can I get to the pirates&apos; camp?</string>
  <string id="27586">Tell me more about the arena.</string>
  <string id="27589">I never actually said I would help you.</string>
  <string id="27590">Goodbye.</string>
  <string id="27591" soundid="100635">Those boys won&apos;t be back any time soon. Losing as a group to one opponent would shame a peasant, let alone a student of the martial arts.</string>
  <string id="27592" soundid="100636">Excellent work. You have bested time itself in destroying that statue! No mean feat, I assure you.</string>
  <string id="27593" soundid="100637">You dealt with Han very well. I knew you would; all of our professional fighters move past him eventually.</string>
  <string id="27598" soundid="100638">Qui, that will be enough.</string>
  <string id="27599" soundid="100639">I bring you a message from my employer, Kai Lan the Serpent. He is impressed with how far you have come in such a short while.</string>
  <string id="27600" soundid="100640">The Serpent wants you to know that he is watching your progress very closely. He is most interested to see how you fare in the Bronze Division.</string>
  <string id="27601" soundid="100641">Qui, you may breathe again. That is all I had to say.</string>
  <string id="27602" soundid="100642"></string>
  <string id="27603" soundid="100643">Well, that was... good, I think.</string>
  <string id="27604" soundid="100644">He has a distinct interest in the proceedings here. He is an ex-champion, you see.</string>
  <string id="27605" soundid="100645">He retired some time ago, even before Raging Ox, who was the champion before the Ravager. Kai Lan couldn&apos;t leave the arena alone, though.</string>
  <string id="27606" soundid="100646">He has become a very important man here, with the help of a group called the Guild.</string>
  <string id="27607" soundid="100647">Lucky Cho is a thug, pure and simple, but he&apos;s very good at what he does. He is also a member of the Guild, and reports directly to Kai Lan. </string>
  <string id="27608" soundid="100648">Kai Lan &quot;oversees&quot; things here in the arena, and the Guild ensures that the authorities leave us in peace.</string>
  <string id="27609" soundid="108691">I see no need to rise to your taunts. I&apos;ve come to accept that most people do not care to understand my philosophy.</string>
  <string id="27610" soundid="108692">Indeed, we should.</string>
  <string id="27611" soundid="100651">The Guild is the organization that controls all of the betting in this place. That gives them considerable sway. It is good that they are happy with your progress.</string>
  <string id="27612" soundid="100652">Between us, the Guild is also involved in more illicit activities. They are very sensitive about remaining an &quot;open secret.&quot; Many know about them, but few acknowledge that fact.</string>
  <string id="27613" soundid="100653">Do not discuss them openly. The Guild has many ears. You may ask some of the others in the arena about them, if you wish, but I would not bring it up to just anyone.</string>
  <string id="27614" soundid="100654">A wise decision. Very wise.</string>
  <string id="27615" soundid="100655">I would not recommend that. I&apos;m sure the authorities are already aware of their existence.</string>
  <string id="27616" soundid="100656">Reporting them for activities you cannot prove is like stirring a chamber pot with a short stick. You&apos;re the one likely to lose in that situation.</string>
  <string id="27617" soundid="100657">You are strong, but they are many and work in shadows. </string>
  <string id="27618" soundid="100658">For the sake of your career, I suggest that you limit any questions you have to your fellow fighters.</string>
  <string id="27621" soundid="100661">Well done! That fight was much better than this wine! </string>
  <string id="27622" soundid="100662">With all the pure water pouring from the palace you&apos;d think they might have learned how to make wine that didn&apos;t taste like goat piss.</string>
  <string id="27623" soundid="100663">Black Whirlwind? That *is* you! Are you back to...?</string>
  <string id="27624" soundid="100664">No! Just here visiting and making sure nothing happens to your newest fighter.</string>
  <string id="27625" soundid="100665">So you won&apos;t be...?</string>
  <string id="27626" soundid="100666">No. Leave it alone, Qui. You know better than to bring this up. Just mind your business, Promoter, and I&apos;ll mind mine.</string>
  <string id="27627" soundid="100667">He.... You travel in curious company. Regardless, when you&apos;re ready, come talk to me again, and we&apos;ll discuss your next match.</string>
  <string id="27628" soundid="100668">I know him, yes, but I know better than to contravicate *his* wishes. If you want to talk about it, ask him. I&apos;m staying out of it.</string>
  <string id="27629" soundid="100669">Now, if you&apos;ll excuse me, I must prepare for your entry into the Bronze Division. It will take me a bit of time before you&apos;ll be ready for your next fight.</string>
  <string id="27630" soundid="100670">That was a good start to the Bronze Division. Those beasts are far stronger than they look.</string>
  <string id="27631" soundid="100671">Fantastic! A test of speed passed with exceptional celery! Now, I&apos;ve....</string>
  <string id="27632" soundid="100672">Your sudden and polite silences are always appreciated, Qui.</string>
  <string id="27633" soundid="100673">I have a message for Raging Dragon.</string>
  <string id="27634" soundid="100674">I&apos;m sure you won&apos;t mind if I take a moment to pass a message to Silver Phoenix.</string>
  <string id="27635" soundid="100675">I have a message for you, Tiger Lifts the Mountain.</string>
  <string id="27636" soundid="100676">Kai Lan the Serpent has, as promised, been watching you intently. You have impressed him so far, and he is interested to see how you fare in your next match.</string>
  <string id="27637" soundid="35942">My husband thought all the smoke was from burning incense... but there&apos;s just too much.</string>
  <string id="27638" soundid="100677">The Serpent foresees your victory in the next match, and he has backed his prediction with silver. He sincerely hopes that his faith in your skills was not misplaced.</string>
  <string id="27639" soundid="108693">You&apos;re lucky you&apos;ve never said anything as piggish to me.</string>
  <string id="27640" soundid="100679">That is all. If you will excuse me, I have some people who need to be spoken to.</string>
  <string id="27641" soundid="100680">Ha, well, I&apos;m certain that won&apos;t be a problem for you. Did you have a question for me?</string>
  <string id="27642" soundid="100681">That was an exceptional fight. I haven&apos;t seen demons in the ring before.</string>
  <string id="27643" soundid="100682">No one questions your skills; that is why you were allowed to fight that beast.</string>
  <string id="27644" soundid="100683">That reminds me, I was asked to instruct you to talk with Lucky Cho before your next match. </string>
  <string id="27646" soundid="100684">He didn&apos;t say, and when I asked, he gave me that glare of his.</string>
  <string id="27647" soundid="100685">I understand, and it is never my intent to impediment your progress! That said, Lucky Cho is not a man I can ignore.</string>
  <string id="27648" soundid="100686">Go, speak with him now. The sooner you do, the sooner I can return you to the ring.</string>

  <string id="27662" soundid="83035">The heavens welcome my machines, but not without considerable cajoling. If you want to fly more than a short distance, I will need an Inscrutable Power Source.</string>
  <string id="27663" soundid="83036">Ha! What wonders cling to you, my friend! There were only two in this whole region, and I destroyed one so Inquisitor Lim would not make off with my Marvelous Dragonfly.</string>
  <string id="27665" soundid="83038">The other was with the Lotus Assassins, but the fools only used it for demolition. Now here you stand with it. I will put it in the Dragonfly, and it will be ready to go.</string>
  <string id="27666" soundid="83039"></string>
  <string id="27667" soundid="83040"></string>
  <string id="27668" soundid="83041">Hm... not the ideal placement. If it shook more, the heavens might think we were afraid and take pity. This is more stable... but not as fun. </string>
  <string id="27669" soundid="83042"></string>
  <string id="27670" soundid="83043"></string>
  <string id="27671" soundid="83044">Okay, she&apos;s ready to go! Hop on. I know a nice safe landing place just outside Tien&apos;s Landing. Very unlikely we&apos;ll crash.</string>
  <string id="27676" soundid="83049">I don&apos;t know. There was one here for the Dragonfly... until I blew it up! That was the only way to keep Inquisitor Lim from taking my Dragonfly to the Imperial City.</string>
  <string id="27677" soundid="83050">I know the Assassins have another one. They were using it for blasting and excavation. Lim once said something about ruins.</string>
  <string id="27678" soundid="83051">If you&apos;re looking for the Inscrutable Power Source, I&apos;d find some ruins that also have Assassins in them.</string>
  <string id="27679" soundid="83052">Ha! Why not just build another sun? Or the tumbling waters of a river? No, an Inscrutable Power Source must be found, not built. Gao found one and brought it here... then I blew it up!</string>
  <string id="27680" soundid="83053">It was the only way to make sure they did not take my Marvelous Dragonfly and fly off to the Imperial City without me. Without an Inscrutable Power Source, she won&apos;t fly very far.</string>
  <string id="27681" soundid="83054">Oh, the Assassins have an Inscrutable Power Source. In fact, they had two. One was here, and they planned to put it in the Dragonfly.</string>
  <string id="27682" soundid="83055">But Kang was fast and smart. Kang exploded the Power Source. That way they couldn&apos;t take my beautiful Dragonfly and fly away without me!</string>
  <string id="27683" soundid="83056">And of course, when you get the Inscrutable Power Source, someone has to actually put it in the Dragonfly. Nobody else can do it!</string>
  <string id="27685" soundid="83058">Ah, yes, the Assassins have one that they took from my workshop. They use it for excavating. I think that Inquisitor Lim said something about the ruins.</string>
  <string id="27686" soundid="83059">So, if I had to hazard a guess, I&apos;d say that if you&apos;re looking for the Inscrutable Power Source, I&apos;d find some ruins that also have Assassins in them.</string>
  <string id="27688">Horse Demon</string>
  <string id="27689">What&apos;s on the other side of the door?</string>
  <string id="27690" soundid="83063">But they *can* make a new inductor. It is extraneous, after all. So a few days ago, I blew up the Inscrutable Power Source. Now the Dragonfly can only make short hops.</string>
  <string id="27692">I have an Inscrutable Power Source.</string>
  <string id="27705">Where would I find an Inscrutable Power Source?</string>
  <string id="27709">Why don&apos;t you build one?</string>
  <string id="27712">How was Lim planning to use the Dragonfly without a Power Source?</string>
  <string id="27714">You can concentrate better, slowing down the world around you even more.</string>
  <string id="27718">Where can I find the Inscrutable Power Source?</string>
  <string id="27720">You have better insight to your opponent&apos;s strengths, allowing you to avoid them.</string>
  <string id="27724">Enough of this. I have to go.</string>
  <string id="27725">Thug</string>
  <string id="27729" soundid="83104">Get to work, mad fool. Do whatever it takes to get that ship built. I will take a short-range flyer and check on some of our other operations in the area.</string>
  <string id="27730" soundid="83105">If the Marvelous Dragonfly is not ready to launch when I return, those captive demons will have a new playmate.</string>
  <string id="27731">But there are pirates wandering all over this town!</string>
  <string id="27735">That&apos;s all I need for now.</string>
  <string id="27741" soundid="83117">Well, if I know Ru he&apos;ll be in the teahouse. He has a fine appreciation for wine, a true connoisseur.</string>

  <string id="27765" soundid="134673">Great Mistress! It is heaven itself to see you again. I have been so... so lost without your wisdom.</string>
  <string id="27768" soundid="83266">Thank you for saving me. I was getting tired of catering to these fools.</string>
  <string id="27775" soundid="83453"></string>
  <string id="27784" soundid="158474">My poor Fen. What have you done to her?</string>
  <string id="27789">I have lost someone as well. Did they have anyone else with them?</string>
  <string id="27797" soundid="83176">I have nary a clue. Unless... very well, you&apos;ve convinced me to talk. It is dangerous to say anything, but I am a brave man. It was that horrible Inquisitor Lim!</string>
  <string id="27799" soundid="83178">Lim oversees the Lotus Assassin operations in this area. A few weeks ago, he came to town and demanded a key to the ruins. Then his men went up there and opened the Great Dam!</string>

  <string id="27802" soundid="83181"></string>
  <string id="27803" soundid="83182">Because you haven&apos;t yet picked on my appearance or my family history. Why stop short of completely obliterating the last little bit of dignity to which Minister Sheng clings?</string>

  <string id="27813" soundid="126666">Back on the farm, I ain&apos;t never seen so many people and buildings in one place. &apos;Cept for livestock. But I guess they ain&apos;t people... or buildings.</string>
  <string id="27814" soundid="126667">My name&apos;s Tian, but everyone calls me Big Tian &apos;cause I&apos;m so big. I came to the city to try and find me a wife. So far it&apos;s not going so good.</string>
  <string id="27815" soundid="126668">Say, you&apos;re real pretty. You want to be my wife? You could come live on my farm. I got chickens and oxen and lots of land.</string>
  <string id="27816" soundid="83195">Minister Sheng has been reduced to a tour guide! The teahouse is the large building just down the hill from here, near the entrance to the town.</string>
  <string id="27817" soundid="83196">It is the lowest point in town, in every sense of the word. Keep following paths downward until you can go no lower. When you see painted ladies and thugs, you&apos;ve arrived.</string>
  <string id="27818" soundid="83197">Minister Sheng may be banished to this festering boil of a town, but I refuse to learn anything of its history! There is far too much for me to worry about as it is.</string>
  <string id="27819" soundid="126669">It would be hard at first, working the farm by ourselves. But after you have six or seven kids, they can help out too!</string>
  <string id="27820" soundid="83199">Ask your questions of the old fool who crouches on the north side of the square, muttering to himself about the old days.</string>
  <string id="27821" soundid="126670">Oh... okay. Well, do you know any other pretty young gals looking for a husband?</string>
  <string id="27822" soundid="126671">But that would really hurt... oh, I get it. You don&apos;t want to marry me. That&apos;s okay. You know any other young gals looking for a husband?</string>
  <string id="27823" soundid="126672">I&apos;m sorry. I don&apos;t know too much about your fancy city ways. I didn&apos;t want to make you mad. I&apos;m just trying to find a nice gal to marry me and come live on my farm.</string>
  <string id="27824" soundid="126673">You wouldn&apos;t happen to know any pretty young gals, would you? Someone who&apos;d want to come live on the farm with me?</string>
  <string id="27825">I&apos;m sorry. There was no other way.</string>
  <string id="27828">Why did they do that?</string>
  <string id="27829">Smiling Mountain</string>
  <string id="27833" soundid="126674">Well, that&apos;s a real shame. If you run across any nice gals, do me a favor and mention my name to them: Big Tian. You have a nice day now.</string>
  <string id="27834" soundid="126675">Wait, don&apos;t go yet. I&apos;m new to the city and I don&apos;t know my way around too good. I&apos;m a little bit lost, too. So many people.</string>
  <string id="27835" soundid="126676">You do? That&apos;s great! Is she pretty? Is she a nice, simple gal who&apos;ll help out on my farm and keep me warm at night?</string>
  <string id="27836" soundid="126677">Well, let&apos;s go meet her. You better lead the way, &apos;cause I don&apos;t know where we&apos;re going.</string>
  <string id="27837" soundid="126678">Price? What are you talking about... oh! I get it! My old father warned me about your type. I ain&apos;t lookin&apos; to buy me no woman. No lady-for-hire type gals for this country boy.</string>
  <string id="27838" soundid="126679">I just want a nice, respectable gal to be my wife. One who can help me out on the farm and such.</string>
  <string id="27839" soundid="126680">Okay. Well, goodbye then. Have a nice day and all.</string>
  <string id="27840">You think Tien&apos;s Landing is a big city?</string>
  <string id="27841">Where is the teahouse?</string>
  <string id="27842">Where is Beggar&apos;s Pier?</string>
  <string id="27843" soundid="100688">Doctor An has already pronounced the poor girl dead. The Doctor wouldn&apos;t say what killed her, though. I suspect a weakness of the heart or some such.</string>
  <string id="27844" soundid="100689">It will not look good that she collapsed when fighting you, but your record has been strong enough to both avoid and pervert suspicion.</string>
  <string id="27846" soundid="108694">This is exactly what I&apos;m talking about. This place draws scum to it as a dunghill pulls flies! Leave me. I will not waste more time with you.</string>
  <string id="27847" soundid="100691">I don&apos;t know if you&apos;ve heard, but Khana has proclared that the first fighter who extriciates her from her championship will learn the secrets of her technique.</string>
  <string id="27848" soundid="100692">Come talk to me when you have a moment.</string>
  <string id="27849" soundid="100693">Come now! The arena works on a strictly regenticated payment system for the fights. There&apos;s no way I can give you extra.</string>
  <string id="27850" soundid="100694">[Success] You&apos;re right, and I suppose the books won&apos;t miss a small token. Here, take this. Don&apos;t tell the others!</string>
  <string id="27851" soundid="100695">[Success] I mean no offence, it&apos;s just.... I see your point. Here take this and don&apos;t tell the others!</string>
  <string id="27852" soundid="100696">[Failure] I&apos;m sorry, but there&apos;s no room for bonuses, extra payments, or gratitudes of any kind. You&apos;ll be fine with the usual winnings.</string>
  <string id="27853" soundid="100697">Now that that&apos;s settled, what else can I do for you?</string>
  <string id="27854" soundid="100698">Another demon falls. We shall have to add a new division for you alone if this keeps up.</string>
  <string id="27855" soundid="100699">Kai Lan the Serpent wishes to speak with you personally. This is a rare honor. Do try to be polite.</string>
  <string id="27856" soundid="100700">You have already been granted access to the back room of the arena, and the Serpent&apos;s private chamber is just off of it. You may as well go now and see what he wants.</string>
  <string id="27857" soundid="108695">Oh, that&apos;s just cold.</string>
  <string id="27858" soundid="100702">I do not know who those men were! The fighters I picked for you to face were not Guild men, and they certainly lacked poison-coated blades.</string>
  <string id="27859" soundid="100703">The wards are useless against poison. That&apos;s a danger we have never been able to solve.</string>
  <string id="27860" soundid="35943">The Emperor&apos;s Tomb is a cherished landmark here in the city. Why would somebody destroy it?</string>
  <string id="27861" soundid="35944">I met the rudest man over in the Scholars&apos; Garden. Apparently he&apos;s an Outlander.</string>
  <string id="27862" soundid="100704">Those men were Kai Lan&apos;s, not mine. I keep myself as far away from that end of things as I can. You have to believe that I look out for my fighters.</string>
  <string id="27863" soundid="100705">Just before you came up here, I received word from one of the Guild men from outside the arena. They send their apologies!</string>
  <string id="27864" soundid="100706">I believe they feel Kai Lan&apos;s actions were not... appropriated to the situation. You shouldn&apos;t have to fear assassins again, not after that message.</string>
  <string id="27865" soundid="100707">You are not hearing this from me, but tensions have risen between the Serpent and the Guild itself. He&apos;s making a bid for control and some... factions are quite upset.</string>
  <string id="27866" soundid="100708">You may feel caught in the middle, but the weather sages say the eye of the storm is the safest place.</string>
  <string id="27867" soundid="108696">I try to share some of my insights and you fling them in my face with all the class of a two silver whore!</string>
  <string id="27868" soundid="100710">I knew you could defeat those... things. The Imperial Army&apos;s telling me they&apos;ve figured out some way to improve upon the design, thanks to you!</string>
  <string id="27869" soundid="35945">The Outlander isn&apos;t so bad, if you don&apos;t mind being shouted at by a fat, obnoxious windbag.</string>
  <string id="27870" soundid="35946">I&apos;m not worried about ghosts. If there are any, the Emperor will deal with them quick enough.</string>
  <string id="27871" soundid="35947">Watch yourself around the Lotus Assassins, there&apos;s something... unnatural about them.</string>
  <string id="28012" soundid="32756">Brother Sui is right. No one can defeat the Ravager, not even the three of us. You stay away from him.</string>
  <string id="28013" soundid="32757">You should steer away from their order. That is all the advice we can offer, and all you should need.</string>
  <string id="28014" soundid="32758">It is a sensitive subject for my brother. He doesn&apos;t like the thought of the arena being less... liberal than he imagines it.</string>
  <string id="28015" soundid="32759">The Guild cares more for a good show than fair play. Good shows keep the bet money flowing, especially if a favored fighter were to suddenly and surprisingly lose.</string>
  <string id="28016" soundid="32760">If you let fear guide your decisions, Brother Bu, you will find that you have walked the coward&apos;s path.</string>
  <string id="28017" soundid="32761">Philosophy aside, the Empire certainly could wipe them out, but wouldn&apos;t another similar organization appear? Regardless, if something could be done, the Empire would have done it already.</string>
  <string id="28018" soundid="32762">You&apos;ll only deal with the lower ranks at this point. Bother us about fighters when you advance to a respectable level.</string>
  <string id="28019" soundid="32763">It seems unfair, does it not? However, you must ask yourself if you wish to be beheaded instantly when you consider this topic.</string>
  <string id="28020" soundid="32764">Let us put it this way. Individually, each of us is an excellent warrior: fast, strong, or smart as it may be. </string>
  <string id="28021" soundid="32765">When we faced the Ravager individually, he beat us quite handily.</string>
  <string id="28022" soundid="32766">He was victorious. Those who guide this arena were so pleased with the spectacle that they created a new challenge. Us.</string>
  <string id="28023" soundid="32767">The thought was that anyone who couldn&apos;t defeat the brothers Sung would be obliterated by the Ravager. I&apos;m sure we have saved more than a few lives.</string>
  <string id="28024" soundid="32768">We have explained this to you already. Either that, or the snake of time--as theorized by the learned sage Eleven Fingers Zhou--has bitten itself in the tail.</string>
  <string id="28025" soundid="32769">Ahh, there&apos;s a mysterious one. Left the Imperial Army under &quot;circumstances.&quot; His skills quickly earned him a high rank in this contest.</string>
  <string id="28026" soundid="32770">I expect he saw things during his time of service that would blanch the ever-rosy face of jolly Ying Tsun the Intoxicated.</string>
  <string id="28027" soundid="32771">And yet, Pretty Li-Li is always hanging off him. We have often speculated why she is so interested in him, but such things are not fit for polite discussion.</string>
  <string id="28029" soundid="32773">Though my brothers sound like offended courtesans, they have a point. We can&apos;t deny the Ravager&apos;s abilities, but he lacks precision.</string>
  <string id="28030" soundid="32774">Strength is part of his technique. In fact, he may be the strongest fighter here in years--stronger even than Raging Ox, our last champion.</string>
  <string id="28031" soundid="32775">All types of combat styles have achieved championship levels.</string>
  <string id="28032" soundid="32776">According to the legends, his stomach reacted violently to eating fish. This spared him the food poisoning that eventually defeated his peers.</string>
  <string id="28033" soundid="32777">Indeed. We wish you luck and promise to attend your funeral after your attempt.</string>
  <string id="28034" soundid="32778">The Ravager&apos;s prowess lies in his incredible stamina. Blows that would fell lesser men are like the bite of a gnat to him. If you face him, use your strongest techniques.</string>
  <string id="28035" soundid="32779">We don&apos;t know nuthin &apos;bout the army.</string>
  <string id="28036" soundid="32780">Please excuse Brother Bu. He occasionally feels the need to speak on things to which he has not given his full attention.</string>
  <string id="28037" soundid="32781">Please, accept our apologies. I&apos;m certain one of the others would be happy to tell you about the city.</string>
  <string id="28038" soundid="62630">The survivors must carry on as best they can. Now, Fuyao and I should be on our way. If we must brave the wilderness, I would rather do it with the sun still in the sky.</string>
  <string id="28039">Talk to Ing</string>
  <string id="28040" soundid="32784">That&apos;s right, Brother Sui. I don&apos;t like ancient people either!</string>
  <string id="28041">Talk to Ing on Beggar&apos;s Pier in Tien&apos;s Landing for a reward.</string>
  <string id="28042" soundid="32786">I would not end this conversation immediately, Brother Bo. Not just before facing this one in the ring. </string>
  <string id="28043" soundid="32787">Brother Sui has an ear for these things and a knowledge of history, you understand? So, I wish you a fond goodbye *and* a distinguished farewell.</string>
  <string id="28044" soundid="32788">Very tricky! Breaking your sentence&apos;s rhythm with an extra well-wishing comment, brother. Skillfully done.</string>
  <string id="28045" soundid="32789">Well, may the full spectrum of the rainbow guide you safely.</string>
  <string id="28046">You cannot change the difficulty settings when you are in combat.</string>
  <string id="28047">You cannot change the difficulty setting when you are flying a mission.</string>
  <string id="28048" soundid="32792">Yes. We shall see you around, of that you can be sure.</string>
  <string id="28051">On Beggar&apos;s Pier in Tien&apos;s Landing, Captain Ing offered a reward to the one who could close the Great Dam. Go to Beggar&apos;s Pier in Tien&apos;s Landing and find Captain Ing to collect your reward.</string>
  <string id="28056">Let&apos;s talk about you. Why are you allowed to fight as a team?</string>
  <string id="28057">Why would I be beheaded?</string>
  <string id="28058">If you&apos;re threatening me, Sung Bo....</string>
  <string id="28060">What made you start fighting together, then?</string>
  <string id="28066">Is he just incredibly strong, then?</string>
  <string id="28068">If he&apos;s clumsy, why is he champion?</string>
  <string id="28071">Regardless, I will crush him eventually and take his title.</string>
  <string id="28074">Can you answer some questions about the city?</string>
  <string id="28075">He&apos;s clearly an idiot, but I still want my questions answered.</string>
  <string id="28077" soundid="62631">Farewell, honored traveler. If you must enter Tien&apos;s Landing, speak with Minister Sheng in the town square. But a better plan would be to get away while you can.</string>

  <string id="28168" soundid="32958">My friends said that someone beat up the Outlander. That&apos;s why he&apos;s not yelling anymore.</string>
  <string id="28169" soundid="32959">I saw the Lotus Assassins fight once; they&apos;re really good. I guess that&apos;s why you joined up with them, huh?</string>
  <string id="28170" soundid="32960">If I was a Lotus Assassin like you, I&apos;d go beat up all the boys who make fun of me.</string>
  <string id="28171" soundid="32961">My mom thinks I shouldn&apos;t talk to you &apos;cause you&apos;re friends with the Lotus Assassins and all.</string>
  <string id="28172" soundid="32962">Someone said you were talking with the Lotus Assassins before... I bet that was really fun.</string>
  <string id="28173" soundid="32963">I bet an arena champion like you could fight a tiger with your bare hands and win!</string>
  <string id="28174" soundid="32964">When I grow up, I want to be an arena champion, too, just like you!</string>
  <string id="28175" soundid="32965">You&apos;re the one who beat the Ravager! I didn&apos;t think anyone could beat him.</string>
  <string id="28176" soundid="32966">Wow... I never thought I would meet an arena champion. You&apos;re amazing.</string>
  <string id="28177" soundid="32967">I&apos;ve never met a Silver round winner before.</string>
  <string id="28178" soundid="32968">My dad says he likes the way you fight &apos;cause you make him lots of silver.</string>
  <string id="28179" soundid="32969">Are you gonna fight the Ravager soon? He&apos;s real tough. I don&apos;t know if you could beat him yet.</string>
  <string id="28180" soundid="32970">I saw the last fight you won. You were great!</string>
  <string id="28181" soundid="32971">If my mom caught me talking to one of the arena fighters, she&apos;d give me a thrashing.</string>
  <string id="28182" soundid="32972">My dad says that when I get bigger, he&apos;ll take me to see the fights in the arena.</string>
  <string id="28183" soundid="32973">Sometimes I sneak in and watch the fights at the arena. Maybe I&apos;ll see you fight next time.</string>
  <string id="28184" soundid="32974">Are you fighting in the arena now? I bet you&apos;ll be really good.</string>
  <string id="28185" soundid="32975">You should see the sword the Outlander has! It makes a real big sound, and smoke comes out of it.</string>
  <string id="28186" soundid="32976">The big guy in the Scholars&apos; Garden talks funny. He sounds like my uncle when he&apos;s been drinking.</string>
  <string id="28216" soundid="33007">No, my friend, it is time to bask in the glory of triumph!</string>
  <string id="28227" soundid="33689">You have successfully completed the mission I gave you. As your reward, we will allow you to begin your training as an Inquisitor of the Lotus Assassins.</string>
  <string id="28229" soundid="33690">There is much that still lies ahead, but I think you will do well. Our training regime is difficult. For some, it is even lethal. But you should have the skills to survive.</string>
  <string id="28231" soundid="33691">Report to the fortress at the far end of the Necropolis. The entrance is there, now that you are worthy of finding it. Make certain your affairs are in order before you go.</string>
  <string id="28241" soundid="33032">Have you seen the smoke and fire? My mom is worried that something bad has happened.</string>
  <string id="28242" soundid="33033">Why would anybody set fire to the Emperor&apos;s Tomb?</string>
  <string id="28243" soundid="33034">That big man in the Scholars&apos; Garden was yelling and shouting and stamping around like an elephant.</string>
  <string id="28244" soundid="33035">I saw a very funny looking man over in the Scholars&apos; Garden today. My friend says he&apos;s an Outlander.</string>
  <string id="28245" soundid="33036">I don&apos;t care even if there are ghosts. The Emperor is stronger than all the ghosts put together.</string>
  <string id="28246" soundid="33037">I&apos;m not scared of the Lotus Assassins, but still wouldn&apos;t want to talk to one.</string>
  <string id="28247" soundid="33038">The princess is very beautiful. If I was like her then all the girls would like me.</string>
  <string id="28248" soundid="33039">My brother teases me about ghosts all the time. But I don&apos;t think there are any.</string>
  <string id="28249" soundid="33040">I bet the ghosts in the Necropolis are the ones who set fire to the tomb.</string>
  <string id="28250" soundid="33041">I saw a big flame shoot up from the Emperor&apos;s Tomb. It kinda looked like when my dad cooks dinner.</string>
  <string id="28251" soundid="33042">The Outlander finally stopped yelling and screaming all the time. I bet he got in trouble with his mom.</string>
  <string id="28252" soundid="33043">I didn&apos;t really like the Outlander before &apos;cause he was always screaming.</string>
  <string id="28253" soundid="33044">My cousin yelled too much, and he lost his voice. Maybe that&apos;s what happened to the Outlander.</string>
  <string id="28254" soundid="33045">I wonder where that Outlander comes from. He sure does have funny clothes.</string>
  <string id="28255" soundid="33046">I don&apos;t know if I should talk to you now that you&apos;re friends with the Lotus Assassins.</string>
  <string id="28256" soundid="33047">You aren&apos;t going to drag me away are you? My mom says the Lotus Assassins like to drag people away.</string>
  <string id="28257" soundid="33048">My dad says the Lotus Assassins are okay, as long as they don&apos;t bother us.</string>
  <string id="28258" soundid="33049">Hey, what&apos;s it like being a Lotus Assassin? I bet you get to do lots of fun stuff.</string>
  <string id="28259" soundid="33050">I bet now that you&apos;re the arena champion you can have any kind of dessert you like.</string>
  <string id="28260" soundid="33051">My brother and me like to play arena. We pretend we&apos;re you and the Ravager fighting for the championship.</string>
  <string id="28261" soundid="33052">I saw the Ravager fight once. He was really good. You must be great!</string>
  <string id="28262" soundid="33053">Hey, you&apos;re the new arena champion, aren&apos;t you? My brother will be so jealous I got to meet you.</string>
  <string id="28263" soundid="33054">My dad says that he&apos;s going to start betting on you now.</string>
  <string id="28264" soundid="33055">My dad said fighting in the arena is only for boys, but I know I could do it.</string>
  <string id="28265" soundid="33056">I wonder if the Ravager is scared now that you&apos;ve won the Silver round.</string>
  <string id="28266" soundid="33057">I had an uncle who won the Silver round, and he was a great fighter.</string>
  <string id="28267" soundid="33058">You don&apos;t look so tough to me. My brother says you have to be real tough to fight in the arena.</string>
  <string id="28268" soundid="33059">My mom thinks the arena is silly. My dad says mom needs to get a hobby.</string>
  <string id="28269" soundid="33060">I like watching the fights at the arena, but only when the good fighters are there.</string>
  <string id="28270" soundid="33061">Is it fun beating up people in the arena? I don&apos;t think I&apos;d like that.</string>
  <string id="28271" soundid="33062">The Outlander is always yelling and fussing. I think he needs a nap.</string>
  <string id="28272" soundid="33063">I tried to listen to the Outlander, but I couldn&apos;t understand anything he was saying.</string>

  <string id="28344" soundid="33136">I don&apos;t know. She is wearing similar clothing... the dark blues. It&apos;s not enough to be sure.</string>
  <string id="28345" soundid="33137">I don&apos;t know. The shaved head and impressive build are similar. It&apos;s not enough to be sure.</string>
  <string id="28346" soundid="33138">I don&apos;t know. The long hair, the purple clothing... very similar. It&apos;s not enough to be sure.</string>
  <string id="28347" soundid="33139">You are mistaken, peasant. If you are the person we seek, your business is of great concern to us.</string>
  <string id="28348" soundid="33140">I don&apos;t like your attitude. I think you are beginning to look more like the person we want.</string>
  <string id="28349" soundid="33141">They were very vague and wouldn&apos;t answer my questions. Are they even sure of who they are looking for?</string>
  <string id="28350" soundid="33142">Just question everyone. This person apparently caused a lot of damage in the south.</string>
  <string id="28352" soundid="33144">Here, what about this one? At least it&apos;s a man, like they said.</string>
  <string id="28354" soundid="33146">You! Identify yourself!</string>
  <string id="28355" soundid="33147">By order of the Emperor and the Lotus Assassins, state your name and purpose for being in the Imperial City!</string>
  <string id="28356" soundid="33148">We are questioning everyone who has arrived in the city recently. You... bear a resemblance to someone we are looking for.</string>
  <string id="28357" soundid="33149">I don&apos;t know. The hair may be similar, as are the wrapped hands and the reddish clothes. It&apos;s not enough to be sure.</string>
  <string id="28358" soundid="33150">Hmm... we could hold him anyway. It&apos;s not a good match, but the Lotus Assassins would leave us be for a few days while they question him.</string>
  <string id="28360" soundid="33152">Is there a problem here, Captain?</string>
  <string id="28362" soundid="33154">Well? Is there?</string>
  <string id="28363" soundid="33155">N-no, Princess Lian. We were questioning this traveler by order of the Lotus Assassins.</string>
  <string id="28364" soundid="33156">There is no need to pursue this questioning any further. You may go.</string>
  <string id="28365" soundid="33157">My apologies, Princess, but I was ordered to detain anyone even vaguely matching....</string>
  <string id="28366" soundid="33158">Captain, this man is here on a personal matter of mine that does not concern you. Do I make myself clear?</string>
  <string id="28367" soundid="33159">Y-yes, Princess Lian.</string>
  <string id="28368" soundid="33160">Then, unless you wish to be transferred to the Wall, you will leave and continue your search.</string>

  <string id="28371" soundid="33163">I don&apos;t know. The young looks... the tunic is similar as well. It&apos;s not enough to be sure.</string>
  <string id="28372" soundid="33164">I don&apos;t know. Shaved head, stern features, monk attire. It&apos;s not enough to be sure.</string>
  <string id="28377">My name is &lt;FullName&gt;. My business is none of yours.</string>
  <string id="28379">Back away. I answer to no one.</string>
  <string id="28387">Of course. I am &lt;FullName&gt;, a simple traveler.</string>
  <string id="28405" soundid="33197">Another pathetic gawker here to bask in the glory that is Iron Soldier, the Silver Division champion? What in all the Empire do *you* want?</string>

  <string id="28411" soundid="33203">Of course, he&apos;ll never do much better, even if more skilled fighters decide to waste their time trying to teach the fool.</string>
  <string id="28412" soundid="33204">Then again, watching Han stumble to Doctor An every time he tries to handle the real Bronze Division fights is one of the most entertaining things about this place.</string>
  <string id="28413">That doesn&apos;t seem very accurate.</string>
  <string id="28418" soundid="139518">Simply speak to them and request a match. The brothers are always eager to test their skills, especially with a new opponent.</string>

  <string id="28820" soundid="33693">A new beginning. Your life becomes the Lotus Assassins. Death&apos;s Hand becomes your guiding spirit. The Emperor is your father above him.</string>
  <string id="28821" soundid="144093">You are like every other simpering peasant that has graced our dungeons. What did any of them contribute to the glory of our age before the Emperor dared to make something of them?</string>
  <string id="28822" soundid="33695">I wish you luck. Perhaps I will see you again. If you survive.</string>
  <string id="28823" soundid="33696">You are a potential recruit for the Executioner, just as you are a potential recruit for me. You still have far to go, but you are at least on your way.</string>
  <string id="28824" soundid="33697">That attitude will make your training more difficult. We lose many applicants because they believe they are something special when they are not. Take heed.</string>
  <string id="28827">You honor me with this opportunity.</string>
  <string id="28830">What can I expect when I arrive?</string>
  <string id="28832">Goodbye.</string>
  <string id="28833">The Executioners have already recruited me.</string>

  <string id="28853" soundid="111991">They... they took Fuyao, my daughter! They took her to the upper levels. I can&apos;t leave without her. Please... you have to find Fuyao!</string>

  <string id="28902" soundid="111993">You want a reward? But... I have nothing. The pirates took it all. Can&apos;t you help her out of the goodness of your heart? </string>
  <string id="28905" soundid="111994">Please, have mercy! She&apos;s never hurt anyone. Don&apos;t leave her in the hands of these monsters! I&apos;m begging you, please!</string>
  <string id="28907">Don&apos;t worry. I&apos;ll find Fuyao for you.</string>
  <string id="28909">I might help you... if the price is right.</string>
  <string id="28910">I don&apos;t have time to look for your daughter.</string>
  <string id="28925" soundid="112025">You monster! You vile beast! You&apos;ve turned my daughter into a savage!</string>

  <string id="28937" soundid="112028"></string>
  <string id="28975" soundid="33848">There are rumors flitting about the city that you seek the attentions of the Executioners. These rumors come from the palace itself, leaving me intrigued.</string>
  <string id="28976" soundid="33849">You are a novice with no standing in the arena. What makes you think you are of any interest to me?</string>
  <string id="28977">In party</string>
  <string id="28978" soundid="33851">Then you do not need my recommendation. If you seek it anyway, you will have to earn it in the arena, and nowhere else.</string>
  <string id="28979" soundid="33852">I have no instruction to give. If you want to catch my eye you need to show me that your skills are far beyond the norm.</string>
  <string id="28980" soundid="33853">If you were to knock Iron Soldier from his perch as Silver Division champion, I would be impressed.</string>
  <string id="28981" soundid="33854">I will be here if you wish to petition me further, but I don&apos;t acknowledge anything less than the best. Return when you are worthy, and no sooner.</string>
  <string id="28982" soundid="33855">Then show it with your skills, not your mouth. Anyone can *talk* about their victories. I need people who let actions speak for them.</string>
  <string id="28983" soundid="33856">You have made a moderate showing in the arena, but that does not explain your brazen nature. What do you think you have to offer?</string>
  <string id="28984" soundid="33857">I have been watching you. Your skills suggested that you were the type of person we were looking for.</string>
  <string id="28985" soundid="33858">Do you think you stand a chance of joining the Lotus Assassins?</string>
  <string id="28986" soundid="33859">No, you are stronger than that. We will train away this timid front and tap a potential that you haven&apos;t yet dreamed of.</string>
  <string id="28987" soundid="33860">If you survive, you will join an order unlike any other. We enforce the will of Death&apos;s Hand and the Emperor. We guard the treasures of the Empire.</string>
  <string id="28988" soundid="33861">This will be your responsibility. Can you look on silver coins, golden tablets, or prophesied artifacts and think only of duty?</string>
  <string id="28989" soundid="33862">Then we will waste no more time. You are adequate, and I will allow you to begin training. Proceed to our fortress.</string>
  <string id="28990" soundid="33863">It lies at the far side of the burial ground that is the Necropolis, which you may reach through the rich section of the city. Present this token, so that they will know you.</string>
  <string id="28991" soundid="33864">If you survive your training and remain in control of your senses, perhaps you will serve at my side one day.</string>
  <string id="28992" soundid="33865">If these things do not tempt you, think no more of them. I only meant to illustrate the extent of our duties.</string>
  <string id="28993" soundid="33866">That is a strong position to take, and one that we respect. You will have to remember, however, that if we accept you, you will be a mere recruit.</string>
  <string id="28994" soundid="33867">Why come to me when you have already begun to court the Inquisitor? Do you seek the blessing of someone less corrupted?</string>
  <string id="28995" soundid="33868">He... does not follow the same path that I do, but if I were to call his behavior into question, mine would be examined as well. My work must continue unhindered.</string>
  <string id="28996" soundid="33869">Besides, the Inquisitor&apos;s attention may have a price, but his recruits are still tested for the skills they need. He is an annoyance, not a weakness.</string>
  <string id="28997" soundid="33870">Now, do you seek my recommendation?</string>
  <string id="28998" soundid="33871">Why have you chosen to come here when you have already earned the favor of the Inquisitor? Do you wish the blessing of someone less corrupted?</string>
  <string id="28999" soundid="33872">You are not yet worthy of my notice. Bronze will catch my eye. Silver will earn my respect.</string>
  <string id="29000" soundid="33873">You have shown some skill, but you are not of interest to me yet. Nothing lower than Silver will earn my respect.</string>
  <string id="29001" soundid="33874">Your victories are impossible for the other fighters to ignore. You are a master of the arena, the ground where Executioners are born.</string>
  <string id="29002" soundid="33875">Perhaps you have potential that you are not even aware of. There may be a role in the Executioners for you after all.</string>
  <string id="29004">I have been recommended by the Inquisitor.</string>
  <string id="29005">This follower is not available.</string>

Practitioners of Iron Palm throw their entire body into each blow, mixing open-handed strikes with powerful, driving assaults. A low stance ensures that each blow directs momentum from the user&apos;s entire body to hit with the force of a sledgehammer. This mixture of power, balance, and brute strength demolishes individual opponents as easily as it scatters groups.</string>

  <string id="29474" soundid="103035">You will be facing all the champions you have dealt with already, and more.</string>
  <string id="29475" soundid="100752"></string>
  <string id="29476" soundid="100753">Han&apos;s tougher than he emulates, isn&apos;t he? When you&apos;re ready to try him again, I&apos;m sure he&apos;ll be happy to help.</string>
  <string id="29477" soundid="100754">There&apos;s no reason you should have lost that fight. I&apos;ll set it up again when you&apos;re ready.</string>
  <string id="29478" soundid="100755">I thought you would be able to tackle that beast. Perhaps I expected the impossible.</string>
  <string id="29479" soundid="100756">Possible or not, it was expected. Kai Lan is most displeased with your fighter&apos;s inabilities.</string>
  <string id="29480" soundid="100757">If you had let me tell our rising star here what they&apos;d be facing, things would have gone differently!</string>
  <string id="29481" soundid="100758">The Serpent feels that this one has abilities far greater than your bronze trash. The fight *was* possible, foreknowledge or not.</string>
  <string id="29482" soundid="100759">Is that so? One loss was not enough to teach you about humility?</string>
  <string id="29483" soundid="100760">You have failed to defeat your foe. Were things done in the ancient ways, you would be dead.</string>
  <string id="29485" soundid="100761">Were that the case, I would ensure that you did not live out the night. That would be most unprofitable for us both.</string>
  <string id="29486" soundid="100762">I suggest that you face this demon again. We will make it part of the schedule. You win, you move on. You lose, you don&apos;t.</string>
  <string id="29487" soundid="100763">Good. When you are ready, speak with Qui. I&apos;m sure he&apos;ll be happy to send you into battle.</string>
  <string id="29488" soundid="100764">Then your career stops here, in the easily tarnished and casually discarded Bronze Division. If you are comfortable with that, simply stop asking for fights.</string>
  <string id="29489" soundid="100765">When you come to your senses, talk to Qui.</string>
  <string id="29490" soundid="100766">Khana&apos;s blade is deadly, is it not? When you wish to challenge her for the Bronze Division championship, simply tell me. I will give you another attempt.</string>
  <string id="29491" soundid="100767">Expect things to be much harder here than they were in the qualifiers. No amateurs to face this time.</string>
  <string id="29492" soundid="139525">That was quite a match. I&apos;ve never seen Third Brother Renshan fight that well, and yet you still beat him.</string>
  <string id="29493" soundid="100768">He proved the stronger this time, but I believe you will dislodge Soldier in time.</string>
  <string id="29494" soundid="100769">Simply ask when you&apos;re ready to try that match again. The fans seem to really take to you, win or lose.</string>
  <string id="29495" soundid="100770">Maybe there is something to the Sung brothers&apos; magicism. They certainly managed to defeat you. If you want to face them again, I&apos;m sure it would be a welcome challenge.</string>
  <string id="29496" soundid="100771">There are no easy tasks before you in the Gold Division. When you are ready, I&apos;ll prepare that match again.</string>
  <string id="29497" soundid="100772">Your loss aside, that was an amazing match. The crowd&apos;s clamoring for more, and they want you front and center! We&apos;ll try it again, when you&apos;re ready.</string>
  <string id="29498" soundid="100773">A loss is a loss, but it&apos;s nothing we can&apos;t get past. We&apos;ll tell them it was all for show.</string>
  <string id="29506" soundid="100777">Many, many people try to break into the Bronze Division and fail miserably. You should be proud of yourself.</string>
  <string id="29507" soundid="100778">Crimson Khana is the champion of this round. You&apos;ll have to face her eventually. Be ready when you do.</string>
  <string id="29508" soundid="100779">The Bronze Division champion approaches. I hope you&apos;re ready for the challenge awaiting you in the Silver Division.</string>
  <string id="29509" soundid="100780">Remember, Soldier&apos;s the champion at this level. He&apos;ll be watching you.</string>
  <string id="29510" soundid="100781">The newest Silver champion has arrived. You are truly in the inner workings of the arena now, my friend. </string>
  <string id="29511" soundid="100782">Listen, I have been thinking. If you&apos;d like to know more about how things truly work, I&apos;d be happy to explain some of the details of the Guild. </string>
  <string id="29512" soundid="100783">Regardless, I would be careful. Some Lotus Assassins have been asking about you. They may try to recruit you.</string>
  <string id="29513" soundid="154009">No doubt many of his years have been worse than death. Once you are truly indoctrinated, you will know the hunger to serve that such loyalty brings.</string>
  <string id="29514" soundid="100785">Enough words of wisdom from me. You can take care of yourself, I&apos;m sure.</string>
  <string id="29517" soundid="100788">You know the Ravager is next. If you&apos;re ready, well....</string>
  <string id="29518" soundid="35951">My friend said she heard fighting by the Emperor&apos;s Tomb earlier. I fear there will be trouble.</string>
  <string id="29519" soundid="100789">Champion, it has been an honor to adjudicate and facilitate your rise to the top.</string>
  <string id="29520" soundid="100790">Should anyone appear to challenge you, I will let you know, but until then rest yourself. You&apos;ve earned it!</string>
  <string id="29521" soundid="108304">[Failure] You mean, so weak is your resolve. Bah, I tire of this game of veiled intent. We blush like children for your amusement.</string>
  <string id="29523" soundid="100793">All the heavens smile upon us when the champion returns to our arena. In this moment, all is as it should be.</string>
  <string id="29524" soundid="100794">What can this humble promoter do for the greatest fighter in the Empire?</string>
  <string id="29525" soundid="100795">I want to hear that you&apos;re ready for your next fight.</string>
  <string id="29526" soundid="100796">What do you need?</string>
  <string id="29527" soundid="100797"></string>
  <string id="29528" soundid="100798">Are you ready to get started?</string>
  <string id="29529" soundid="104829">Get over here, Silver champion. We have something to discuss.</string>
  <string id="29532">Shen has told you that the corpse of the Elder Tanner Fong has risen from its grave and wandered off, returning to his home. His son, who inherited the home, is none too pleased. He wants a refund or the corpse gone, and Shen doesn&apos;t like refunds.</string>
  <string id="29533">The Tanners Fong</string>
  <string id="29534" soundid="134674">I have left you without my guidance for far too long, Abbot Song. But I could not speak with you; my strength was consumed contacting the last of the order.</string>
  <string id="29535" soundid="134675">You are the last. There is no one else that can do what you are destined to do. I had to conserve and prepare. I did not know the exact day you would cross to this realm.</string>
  <string id="29536" soundid="100806">Excellent. Follow me and we&apos;ll get you ready for your next match.</string>
  <string id="29537" soundid="35952">Now that the Outlander has been defeated, the Scholars&apos; Garden is one again a place of peace.</string>
  <string id="29538" soundid="100807">If that&apos;s the decision you want to make, it&apos;s your profanation. You just let me know when you&apos;ve changed your mind.</string>
  <string id="29539" soundid="100808">For your first match, we&apos;ll start you off against a mighty ogre. I&apos;ll be watching your style closely to see how you fare. Impress me and I&apos;ll take you to the top.</string>
  <string id="29540" soundid="100809">Even our great champions start out against the ogre. Take Raging Ox, who danced around the beast singing drunkenly to earn the crowd&apos;s favor, or the Ravager, who defeated him in a single blow.</string>
  <string id="29541" soundid="100810">You didn&apos;t want to hear my quick lesson on how the arena works last time we talked. Changed your mind at all?</string>
  <string id="29542" soundid="35953">We are not as backwards as the Outlander thinks. Surely he knows that now.</string>
  <string id="29543" soundid="100811">I&apos;ve already explained how things work around here. Do you need me to go over it again?</string>
  <string id="29544" soundid="100812">I should take a moment and explain the system we use here.</string>
  <string id="29545" soundid="100813">I like to keep things simple and organized. Any other way, and things get more convultated than the Celestial Court on the Emperor&apos;s birthday.</string>
  <string id="29546" soundid="100814">When you&apos;re ready for your match, ask me about it, and I&apos;ll give you a quick summary of your opponent. I&apos;ll be setting up your matches, of course.</string>
  <string id="29547" soundid="154010">His name is not spoken to the acolytes. You must understand that to oppose Death&apos;s Hand is to lose all connection to your masters. Even if you live, you do not exist.</string>
  <string id="29548" soundid="35954">Perhaps the Outlander will treat new cultures differently now that he&apos;s had a taste of humility.</string>
  <string id="29549" soundid="100816">Various enchantments woven in this place keep the fights from being deadly, but they&apos;re no less real. You&apos;ll feel the pain if you don&apos;t keep your defense up.</string>
  <string id="29550" soundid="35955">Ah, at last. Peace and tranquility have returned to the Scholars&apos; Garden.</string>
  <string id="29551">Perhaps we should change the subject.</string>
  <string id="29552">Sounds like you&apos;re trying to compensate for something. Did your father dress you as a boy when you were little?</string>
  <string id="29553" soundid="100819">That&apos;s the spirit, dive right in with both feet first! It&apos;s not that difficult a system, and you seem bright enough to figure it out.</string>
  <string id="29554" soundid="100820">Since you held your own against the ogre brute last time, I&apos;m going to try something exciting for the crowd.</string>
  <string id="29555" soundid="100821">I&apos;ve got four boys from some school west of the city who&apos;ve been bothering me for some tougher matches. I&apos;m giving you all of them at once.</string>
  <string id="29557" soundid="100822">It&apos;ll wow the crowd and teach them a lesson at the same time. Remember to watch your sides and back.</string>
  <string id="29558" soundid="100823">The crowd&apos;s starting to catch on to you, have you noticed? People like you, and now I&apos;m going to make sure they pay attention.</string>
  <string id="29559" soundid="100824">I&apos;m going to have a roughly hewn statue hauled into the ring. I want you to discomtructulate it. Destroy the statue quickly enough, and I&apos;ll give you a shot at Hapless Han.</string>
  <string id="29561" soundid="100826">I think you&apos;re ready to face Hapless Han. Show me you&apos;re ready for the big time, and I&apos;ll make sure you don&apos;t have to dance with the children anymore.</string>
  <string id="29562" soundid="100827">Now that you have qualified for the Bronze Division, your challenges will be more difficult, but you&apos;ll earn greater rewards.</string>
  <string id="29563" soundid="100828">I want the very abacuses of heaven to rattle with the name Raging Dragon, so I&apos;ve prepared something memorable.</string>
  <string id="29564" soundid="100829">The stars themselves need to hear of Silver Phoenix if you&apos;re to make it in this division, so I&apos;ve prepared a match to remember.</string>
  <string id="29565" soundid="100830">I want people to remember Tiger Lifts the Mountain, so I&apos;ve crafted a suitably memorable challenge for your introduction to the division.</string>
  <string id="29566" soundid="100831">The guards rounded up a group of sub-human... things around the Great Southern Forest. Were going to release them into the ring in groups for you.</string>
  <string id="29568" soundid="100833">Next you&apos;re going to step into what we call the Pit of Pain. It&apos;s not the most original name, I&apos;ll admit, but that&apos;s five hundred years of tradition for you.</string>
  <string id="29569" soundid="35956">Those Lotus Assassins are the... ah, best group of people ever. The best. Bye now.</string>
  <string id="29570" soundid="35957">Please, I don&apos;t know anything. Just let me be.</string>
  <string id="29571">Exactly how many long, lonely nights with only a sword as company would it take to understand your philosophy?</string>
  <string id="29572" soundid="100835">As you know, the demon awaits you. You&apos;ll have to face him to proceed.</string>
  <string id="29573" soundid="100836">Ah, yes... your next fight. There&apos;s... been a bit of a change in plans. Not that it will affect you too much, of course. It&apos;s all part of the traditions of the arena, you see.</string>
  <string id="29574" soundid="100837">I have word that you&apos;re going to be facing a fighter specially chosen from the Guild, you see. As soon as you&apos;re ready, you&apos;ll be facing him instead of a normal match.</string>
  <string id="29575" soundid="100838">I was originally thinking that you&apos;d done well enough to face Crimson Khana for the Bronze Division championship. Things change when the Guild is involved, though.</string>
  <string id="29576" soundid="100839">The Guild&apos;s the organization that controls the betting here. That&apos;s not all, though; Kai Lan the Serpent has a lot of influence here, as well.</string>
  <string id="29577" soundid="35958">I have nothing against the Lotus Assassins. If the Emperor likes them, then so do I.</string>
  <string id="29578" soundid="35959">Hey, didn&apos;t I see you speaking with the Lotus Assass--um, never mind.</string>
  <string id="29579" soundid="35960">I can&apos;t believe that the Ravager was actually Raging Ox. That&apos;s just so strange.</string>
  <string id="29580" soundid="35961">I do not approve of the fighting, but it *is* exciting to meet an arena champion in person.</string>
  <string id="29581" soundid="35962">When he grows up, my son wants to be the arena champion, just like you.</string>
  <string id="29582" soundid="35963">My husband won a great deal of silver betting on you in the arena championship!</string>
  <string id="29583" soundid="100840">I have to bow to certain pressures. I don&apos;t like it that much, but smart men don&apos;t voice that opinion too loudly. Not around here....</string>
  <string id="29584">Town of Two Rivers</string>
  <string id="29586">[Charm] This is my chance to make it up to you.</string>
  <string id="29588">[Intuition] You can&apos;t meet Fang without getting some sleep.</string>
  <string id="29591">Where can I find Fang again?</string>
  <string id="29592">Any suggestions how I can get rid of Fang?</string>
  <string id="29594" soundid="132720">That should give us all some time to think.</string>
  <string id="29598" soundid="132724">She&apos;s dangerous like these ghosts. We&apos;re all afraid of her.</string>
  <string id="29601" soundid="80430">See the keeper if you wish to talk.</string>
  <string id="29603" soundid="132730">The tales say this man once stormed an entire fortress alone, naked, and screaming his defiance into the night.</string>
  <string id="29604" soundid="132731">Ha! Scared the tar out of those border guards! But they botched the story; I was naked, screaming, *and* I was dead drunk. </string>
  <string id="29605" soundid="132732">Wouldn&apos;t you like to know, missy! Let&apos;s just say it&apos;s the only part that matters!</string>
  <string id="29606" soundid="132733">Pretty much the part you&apos;d expect. Makes &apos;em curl up in shame, if you take my meaning.</string>
  <string id="29608" soundid="132735">We didn&apos;t exactly fight to the death, did we? Besides, I&apos;m not nearly drunk enough to be at the top of my game. There&apos;s nothing to drink in this blasted forest.</string>
  <string id="29609">Minister Sheng&apos;s Sword</string>
  <string id="29610" soundid="136089">If we did, would I be here?</string>
  <string id="29612">Find the Outlander</string>
  <string id="29617">Which part of your naked, drunk, and screaming attack works best?</string>
  <string id="29621">You didn&apos;t seem all that skilled to me.</string>
  <string id="29622">This long sword is the prized weapon of Minister Sheng, the local representative of the Ministry of Harmony. Known for its careful balance between speed and power, the long sword is a favored weapon among those who desire a deadly blade without the ponderous weight of an axe. The swirling motions of the Long Sword style make it great at dispatching groups of enemies and discouraging your foe&apos;s allies from getting too close. </string>

  <string id="29632" soundid="139526">It certainly didn&apos;t look easy from where I was standing, but nevertheless, you did beat him.</string>
  <string id="29634" soundid="139527">I suspected something was amiss. But you overcame it, and you still won.</string>
  <string id="29643" soundid="34740">Now is not a good time to speak with me. You may try my brother, Bo.</string>
  <string id="29644" soundid="34741">If you wish to speak to one of us, Bo will be the most amenable.</string>
  <string id="29645" soundid="34742">I shouldn&apos;t talk too much. Talk to Brother Bo instead.</string>
  <string id="29646" soundid="34743">You&apos;re nice, but I think you should talk to Bo, not me.</string>
  <string id="29647" soundid="34744">If you want to talk, Brother Bo is better at it than I am.</string>
  <string id="29725" soundid="139528">Master Radiant was sure you would prevail, he asked me to bring you to him once you defeated Third Brother. You won&apos;t have to test yourself against me after all.</string>
  <string id="29727" soundid="139529">Come, let&apos;s go see him. He is anxious to speak with you.</string>
  <string id="29762" soundid="34859">Excuse me... out of my way. I&apos;ve got to get these buns to the Scholars&apos; Garden quick, quick. Now move.</string>
  <string id="29764" soundid="34861">I&apos;m very sorry. Please accept my heartfelt apologies. My husband has the manners of a strutting cock sometimes.</string>
  <string id="29765" soundid="34862">Hmm. I seem to recall you rather enjoyed my, ah... strutting at one time, old woman. </string>
  <string id="29766" soundid="34863">Shush now. You&apos;ll offend the gods of decency. This poor traveler&apos;s likely to think the Imperial City is full of indecent folk and offensive talk.</string>
  <string id="29767" soundid="34864">Now then, after all the trouble we&apos;ve caused you, is there anything we can help you with? We&apos;ve got fresh buns. Just made them myself.</string>
  <string id="29768" soundid="34865">Bah! Talk, talk, talk... that&apos;s all people want to do. I don&apos;t get paid to talk... I sell buns, that&apos;s what I do.</string>
  <string id="29769" soundid="34866">My yapping... rrgh. You&apos;re fortunate my wife is here, or I&apos;d show you a thing or two!</string>
  <string id="29770" soundid="34867">Don&apos;t bother, husband. This ruffian isn&apos;t worth your time and effort. Let&apos;s be on our way. We have more important things to tend to.</string>
  <string id="29771" soundid="35077">I have nothing more to say to you. Good day.</string>
  <string id="29777">Do you mind if I ask you two some questions?</string>
  <string id="29778">Who are you two? What are you doing here?</string>
  <string id="29779">What can you tell me about the Imperial City?</string>
  <string id="29780">Tell me what you know about Death&apos;s Hand.</string>
  <string id="29781">I am searching for Master Li. Have you heard of him?</string>
  <string id="29782">I need some answers, but I don&apos;t need all this banter.</string>
  <string id="29783">I&apos;d buy a bun if I could cram it down your yapping maw!</string>
  <string id="29786" soundid="100844">No, I can&apos;t actually. The Serpent, who is the Guild&apos;s chief agent in this place, has specifically requested you.</string>
  <string id="29787" soundid="100845">I&apos;m certain it will be a small thing. Best to just finish it now.</string>
  <string id="29788" soundid="100846">A noble and ultimately meaningless sediment, my friend. Regardless of what you wish, I have to give in to certain pressures, and you will go no further than this match if your pride is so offended.</string>
  <string id="29790" soundid="100848">I&apos;m sorry. Until you speak with Lucky Cho, as he requested, I&apos;m permanently reluctant to send you into the ring.</string>
  <string id="29791" soundid="100849">Until the Guild stepped in, I was ready to give you an attempt at the Bronze Division for your last match. Now it&apos;s time.</string>
  <string id="29792" soundid="100850">Are you ready to face Crimson Khana, the finest sword this august arena has seen in five genritations?</string>
  <string id="29793" soundid="100851">Now that you are champion of the Bronze Division, the Silver Division awaits. It seems that, indirectly, the Serpent has decided to keep your career interesting.</string>
  <string id="29794" soundid="100852">A demon has been added to the regular roster since your earlier victory, and since you&apos;ve shown aptitude, I&apos;m letting you face him first.</string>
  <string id="29795" soundid="100853">This is indeed an honor, though it will not be easy. Are you ready to defeat this horror?</string>
  <string id="29796" soundid="100854">I&apos;m afraid that until you talk with the Serpent, I can&apos;t let you go out there and face anyone. He was... quite incessant. Go talk to him first.</string>
  <string id="29797" soundid="35964">Doing well in the arena can draw unwanted attention.</string>
  <string id="29798" soundid="100855">This next fight should be fairly simple for you. I once more want to send you up against four opponents. The crowd loves those fights.</string>
  <string id="29799" soundid="100856">These are tougher than the students you faced before, but should pose no problem.</string>
  <string id="29803" soundid="100860">We&apos;ve had a request from the Imperial Army. They want one of our best to help them test out a small group of war machines known as golems.</string>
  <string id="29804" soundid="100861">I&apos;ve decided to put you up against them. I want you to prove that our folks are superior to any &quot;thing&quot; the army could devise.</string>
  <string id="29805" soundid="100862">Are you ready to show them what you&apos;ve got?</string>
  <string id="29806" soundid="100863">One of the reasons you&apos;re become such a crowd favorite is because you&apos;re willing to fight in the more extravagatastic battles. I want to really drive that point home.</string>
  <string id="29807" soundid="100864">Your going to participate in a timed fight. I&apos;ve rounded up a lot of the hopefuls, and I need you to eliminate ten of them in three minutes. It won&apos;t be easy, but if anyone can do it, you can.</string>
  <string id="29808" soundid="100865">Show me you can handle this, and I&apos;ll give you a shot at Soldier and the Silver Division championship. Are you ready to show them what you&apos;ve got?</string>
  <string id="29809" soundid="100866">I rushed out notification of this match, and we&apos;ve had the outcriers shouting themselves hoarse. I hear many nobles will even be in attendance.</string>
  <string id="29810" soundid="100867">It&apos;s rare that the Silver Division rests balanced against a single victory on the scales of combat, you know!</string>
  <string id="29811" soundid="35965">You have certainly done better in the arena than I would have guessed. Good luck in your future fights.</string>

  <string id="29813" soundid="139530">There you are. Master Radiant has gone, and I am left to lead this school on my own. I&apos;ll miss him very much, but at least we are rid of Smiling Hawk.</string>
  <string id="29815" soundid="139531">I wanted to thank you for all you&apos;ve done, but I also wanted to show you some items that belonged to Master Smiling Hawk. I thought you might find something of interest.</string>
  <string id="29817">Customize Character Abilities</string>
  <string id="29842" soundid="34941">Yes, yes... more questions. Are you sure I couldn&apos;t interest you in a bun? They&apos;re nice and fresh... or at least, they were when we started talking.</string>
  <string id="29843" soundid="34942">Death&apos;s Hand! Now there&apos;s a name you don&apos;t hear often. I&apos;m just a simple bun-seller, but even I know enough to be careful who I utter that name around.</string>
  <string id="29844" soundid="34943">For once we agree, husband. Death&apos;s Hand is a walking nightmare. It is said that if you see him coming, then it&apos;s already too late. </string>
  <string id="29845" soundid="34944">But enough of wives&apos; tales. Just be careful who you mention that name to, unless you wish to draw bad attention to yourself.</string>
  <string id="29846" soundid="34945">If he hasn&apos;t bought a bun from me, I likely don&apos;t know him. Come to think of it, if he hasn&apos;t bought a bun from me, I don&apos;t *want* to know him!</string>
  <string id="29847" soundid="34946">Junda, you withered old coconut, what&apos;s your problem? There&apos;s more to life than selling these buns you know.</string>
  <string id="29848" soundid="34947">I&apos;m sorry to say I haven&apos;t heard of your friend either, and I&apos;m not sure what you mean by &quot;master.&quot; Try the Scholars&apos; Garden. The people there might know your friend.</string>
  <string id="29849" soundid="34948">Go then. I have buns to sell, and it doesn&apos;t look like you&apos;re buying.</string>
  <string id="29850" soundid="34949">Don&apos;t mind him. He just takes a while to get used to. Much like an ache in the bones, if it lasts long enough. Eventually you learn to ignore it. Good day to you.</string>
  <string id="29851" soundid="34950">Did you hear that, Lina? I think we were just told to keep it short. Perhaps I&apos;ll keep it short and say goodbye!</string>
  <string id="29852" soundid="34951">Now, now, Junda. It&apos;s nothing worse than you&apos;ve already said yourself. Not everyone is as tolerant of your ramblings as I am.</string>
  <string id="29853" soundid="34952">Go on then. Ask your questions, and we&apos;ll try to answer them as quickly as possible.</string>
  <string id="29854" soundid="34953">You again. We have nothing to say to you. Move along. I have buns to sell.</string>
  <string id="29855" soundid="34954">Junda! Who are you berating now? Oh, it&apos;s you. We have no time for the likes of you!</string>
  <string id="29857" soundid="34956">I hear you&apos;re the new arena champion. I&apos;d like to think my buns gave you strength and helped you win... but I don&apos;t think you ever bought one, did you?</string>
  <string id="29858">The Dragon of Storms</string>
  <string id="29868" soundid="34967">So, you&apos;ve thrown your lot in with those damn Assassins. I don&apos;t sell buns to them or their friends.</string>
  <string id="29869" soundid="34968">Junda! Don&apos;t go judging our potential customers, especially based on rumors. Besides, I saw you selling buns to an Assassin just the other day.</string>
  <string id="29870" soundid="34969">That was different. He looked like he might... cause some trouble if I didn&apos;t offer him something. So... you buying any buns then?</string>
  <string id="29878" soundid="138750">The human comes out of the air and smells of blood!</string>
  <string id="29879" soundid="138751">All is perfect! The Mother is free, the caves in the back are open, and this one will feed us tonight!</string>
  <string id="29880" soundid="138752">Then you are strong. Strong enough that we will grow even more powerful when we consume you!</string>
  <string id="29881" soundid="34980">There&apos;s a terrible commotion over at the Lotus Assassin fortress. You wouldn&apos;t have anything to do with that now would you?</string>
  <string id="29882" soundid="34981">Junda! You know better than to pry into our customers&apos; affairs. It&apos;s none of our business.</string>
  <string id="29883" soundid="34982">Junda thinks he&apos;s a grand inquisitor sometimes. He&apos;s really just a nosey old man. Can I get you some fresh buns today? I just made them.</string>
  <string id="29884" soundid="138753">With the Mother free, we are stronger than ever!</string>
  <string id="29885" soundid="138754">[Success] You are strong, but there are many of us in the caves below! You would not dare follow.</string>

  <string id="29892">[Intimidation] I killed the Keeper, and I&apos;ll do the same to you unless you run... now!</string>
  <string id="29893" soundid="34992">Get your buns here. Fresh buns, just made this morning.</string>
  <string id="29894" soundid="34993">Hot buns, fresh from the oven. Come and get them while they last.</string>
  <string id="29895" soundid="34994">Ha! No time to talk he says! The only time *you&apos;re* ever quiet is when you&apos;re eating one of my buns... now be polite and answer some questions.</string>
  <string id="29896" soundid="34995">We&apos;re members of the local traveling circus. I&apos;m a fire eater, and Lina is a juggler. We just sell buns on the side to make a little extra silver.</string>
  <string id="29897" soundid="34996">Junda! Could you try to be civil just this once?</string>
  <string id="29898" soundid="34997">This buffoon of a man is Junda, and I am Lina, his wife... as he is fond of reminding me. We sell buns here in the city. Well, I bake, and he sells.</string>
  <string id="29899" soundid="34998">There is much to tell about the city, but we do need to sell the buns while they&apos;re fresh. Perhaps you could be more specific.</string>
  <string id="29901" soundid="35000">Why don&apos;t you go and check out the Imperial Arena. It&apos;s a prosperous place to sell buns, especially before a big fight.</string>
  <string id="29902" soundid="35001">You and those fights... I can&apos;t stand watching them. I prefer to take walks by the Wall or just gaze at the magnificent palace.</string>
  <string id="29903" soundid="35002">What&apos;s to tell? Fighters fight, spectators watch, gamblers gamble... it&apos;s just like any other arena. Except the level of competition is very high here.</string>
  <string id="29904" soundid="35003">I&apos;d talk to Qui the Promoter if you really want to know more about the arena. He talks more than you do, but at least he buys my buns.</string>
  <string id="29905" soundid="35004">It&apos;s busy, but it&apos;s a good place to get information and meet people. Best wine in the Empire, too.</string>
  <string id="29906" soundid="35005">How would you know, you lazy lout? You&apos;ve never been outside the city in your life! Best in the Empire... ha! Probably the only wine you&apos;ve ever had.</string>
  <string id="29907" soundid="35006">The Wall is magnificent... it just keeps growing. Though I pity the criminals who are forced to work there. Very few ever return.</string>
  <string id="29908" soundid="35007">The palace is truly one of our greatest treasures. The heavens have indeed blessed our Empire greatly to give to us such a beautiful edifice.</string>
  <string id="29909" soundid="35008">Bah! It&apos;s unnatural I say. Just floating up in the air. Emperor or no, it&apos;s not right to live in a place that just... floats like that.</string>
  <string id="29910" soundid="35009">What did you want to know?</string>
  <string id="29911" soundid="35010">Well, this district is called the Market District. This is where most of the buying and selling happens. Most of the lower classes live and work here.</string>
  <string id="29912" soundid="35011">And die here, too! Not like those nobles and wealthy merchants over in the Golden Way or in the Scholars&apos; Garden. Born into a life of luxury... ha, must be nice.</string>
  <string id="29913" soundid="35012">Yes dear. Life has been cruel hasn&apos;t it? Good work, a wonderful family, and many friends... poor Junda. Next you&apos;ll blame the nobles for your backaches, too.</string>
  <string id="29918" soundid="138767">Through Sun Li&apos;s cunning, the armies of the Emperor laid siege to the gates of Dirge. They came to seize the Water Dragon&apos;s power and her life-giving waters.</string>
  <string id="29920">Could I go back to my original questions?</string>
  <string id="29925">I should be going.</string>
  <string id="29930">Being an argument on the origins of Focus.

Min Shi the Dragon of Storms was a master who lived hundreds of years before the formation of the Jade Empire. Legends of her exploits could fill a library, and while the veracity of such fables must be questioned, all the yarns agree that she formalized the teachings of the Storm Dragon style and brought knowledge of true focus to the martial arts. 

Debates still rage on the subject, but the evidence is there to support such claims. Take, for instance, that harmonic combinations initiated by Storm Dragon invariably allow the user to collect his thoughts and steal some of his opponent&apos;s focus essence. Such a synergy is hard to dismiss, and when I questioned Jian the Iron Fist, a master of some renown, he replied, &quot;Only a fool denies legends. They always hold a grain of truth.&quot; Jian speaks wisely; would it be so hard to accept that Storm Dragon was developed to make it easier for its adepts to achieve true focus in battle? This author thinks not.</string>
  <string id="29964">Tell me about the key landmarks in the city.</string>
  <string id="29966">What can you tell me about the arena?</string>
  <string id="29968">Tell me more about the tavern.</string>
  <string id="29970">I&apos;d like to know more about the Wall and the palace.</string>
  <string id="29973">I want to ask you something else about the city.</string>
  <string id="29974">I&apos;d like to know more about the various districts.</string>
  <string id="29978" soundid="35078">Hello there. Our buns are nice and fresh. I just took them out of the oven.</string>
  <string id="29979" soundid="35079">Talk to Junda if you&apos;d like to buy some buns.</string>
  <string id="29980" soundid="35080">I expect bad attitudes from Junda, but I don&apos;t need it from you as well.</string>
  <string id="30121" soundid="80371">Ah, there you are, my student. Your bout with Jing Woo had a surprising end. I hope I have not caused you to grow complacent in practice bouts.</string>

  <string id="30626" soundid="100874">I was going to do something different, but I&apos;ve had a request from the Sung brothers. They said that there has been, ah... an affluence of the fates and a... a remergence of the planets.</string>

  <string id="30637" soundid="103087">The Lotus Assassins watch this place like vultures circling a sick buffalo. They recruit new talent from among the best fighters.</string>

  <string id="30640" soundid="100888">As I told you before, you&apos;re going to have to emerge victorious from the Imperial Engagement before I can give you that opportunity.</string>

  <string id="30650" soundid="100898">Khana&apos;s a bit of a mystery to me. Keeps not a coin of her winnings, but is unbeaten. She&apos;s in this purely for the challenge, I think.</string>
  <string id="30651" soundid="100899">If you face her, you&apos;ll find that her swordsmanship is deadly. Khana&apos;s studied techniques only found in the Prosperous East, the provinces she calls home.</string>
  <string id="30652" soundid="100900">Soldier is a worthy opponent. I hope you understand how many warriors have tried to extrapolate him from the Silver Division championship.</string>
  <string id="30653" soundid="100901">He&apos;ll be watching you, so expect him to anticipate your style if you face him.</string>
  <string id="30654" soundid="100902">The real champion is the Ravager, but the Sung brothers are your first hurdle. Who were you curious about?</string>
  <string id="30655" soundid="100903">The crowd loves to hate him. He&apos;s vicious, he never talks, and he has no interest in the fans, but when he fights he&apos;s unstoppable.</string>
  <string id="30656" soundid="100904">Right now, almost no one will face him, so it&apos;s rare that the Ravager steps into the ring. It&apos;s for the better I think. He tends to cripple people, despite the protective magic of this place.</string>
  <string id="30657" soundid="100905">They&apos;re an odd triptuplet if you ask me. They were three of the best individual fighters to participate in the arena, but things changed after they fought together against the Ravager and lost.</string>
  <string id="30658" soundid="100906">They&apos;re sort of a buffer: If the three of them together couldn&apos;t match the Ravager, only someone who can face all three will stand a chance against him.</string>
  <string id="30659" soundid="100907">It cuts down on the number of injuries at the Ravager&apos;s hands. If you want to know more about them, you can ask the brothers themselves.</string>
  <string id="30660" soundid="100908">The only person left to face is the Ravager. Defeat him and the championship is yours. What more is there to say?</string>
  <string id="30661" soundid="100909">Recruiters hover around this place, I&apos;ll admit. Nothing anyone can do about that. If they haven&apos;t approached you yet, they will.</string>
  <string id="30662" soundid="100910">The Executioners always recruit from the top arena talent; we lose a lot of rising stars to their order, but... I&apos;m sure they&apos;re provided for.</string>
  <string id="30663" soundid="100911">Take my advice, though: Don&apos;t bind yourself to their mill wheel. It can lead to no good. I didn&apos;t give you that advice though, and I&apos;d rather not talk about them any further.</string>
  <string id="30664" soundid="100912">Don&apos;t pester me about them, I&apos;m sure they will approach you soon enough.</string>
  <string id="30665" soundid="100913">Recruiters? Well, yes, recruiters are occasionally interested in the talent here at the arena, but it&apos;s nothing to concern yourself over.</string>
  <string id="30666" soundid="100914">They are merely observing. Obey the laws of the Empire and the assassins will leave you alone.</string>
  <string id="30667" soundid="100915">You know all about him by now, don&apos;t you? Ex-champion, magician of great prestidigitation, and the man behind everything wrong with this place.</string>
  <string id="30668" soundid="100916">It was simple enough for him. There&apos;s always been an affiliation of criminals known as the Guild in this city.</string>
  <string id="30669" soundid="100917">Kai Lan&apos;s skills as a magician and his huge prize winnings allowed him to work his way high in their ranks. Now there&apos;s something of a... gap at the top.</string>
  <string id="30670" soundid="100918">No one really knows. He didn&apos;t seem to have them when he was in the arena, but there was a period after his retirement when he vanished like the dying strains of a song.</string>
  <string id="30671" soundid="100919">By that, I mean you would think you had heard of him, but could never be sure. Then suddenly he returned and just... stepped into control of the arena.</string>
  <string id="30672" soundid="100920">There are rumors that he might have gone off to join the Lotus Assassins, but no one&apos;s really sure. It might explain his newfound skills, though.</string>
  <string id="30673" soundid="100921">Me? I&apos;m just a simple promoter. If the Guild tightens their hold, I simply make do. I don&apos;t necessarily want to help them, but I know the price of resisting them.</string>
  <string id="30674" soundid="100922">I&apos;m not like you. I can&apos;t defend myself in the same way.</string>
  <string id="30675" soundid="100923">Always nice to move on to other subjects, I assure you.</string>
  <string id="30676" soundid="100924">Kai Lan is truly in charge of this place because of his association with the Guild. If he gets things his way, he&apos;ll seize control of the whole Guild before long.</string>
  <string id="30677" soundid="100925">It&apos;s nothing to concern yourself with. If anything comes up with the Guild or the Serpent, I will negotiate and delibertate with them, not you.</string>
  <string id="30678" soundid="100926">More than I&apos;d care to. I strongly suspect that Lucky Cho&apos;s disappearance was no coincidence.</string>
  <string id="30679" soundid="100927">I wondered when things would come to a head. I was hoping Black Whirlwind would just stay away, but he won&apos;t, will he? Not while you&apos;re here.</string>
  <string id="30680" soundid="100928">No, no! Not lying. Sure, I had some suspicions, but I have no proof.</string>
  <string id="30681" soundid="100929">I wondered. It seemed too convenient that he&apos;d one day just suddenly leave and never return, with only a letter to tell us he was going.</string>
  <string id="30683" soundid="100931">The last thing he needs is accusations of murder. He&apos;s already filled a dozen scrolls with records of public drunkenness, crimes against decency, and violence.</string>
  <string id="30684" soundid="100932">Now, let&apos;s not speak of this again. If you must speak of it, talk to your friend directly.</string>
  <string id="30685" soundid="100933">Talk to your friend if you must know about Raging Ox. Leave me out of it.</string>
  <string id="30686" soundid="100934">Your large friend there was once a competitor here, so I know him in passing, you might say.</string>
  <string id="30687" soundid="100935">This is his business, though. Why not ask him? I&apos;m sure he&apos;ll tell you whatever he deems appropriate.</string>
  <string id="30688" soundid="100936">I&apos;ll have to revise my stories of this place to include your rise to champion. It was for the better, but you unsettled a great many things here.</string>
  <string id="30689" soundid="100937">I&apos;m always happy to share some history with this arena&apos;s greatest fighters. Would you like to hear some of the tales?</string>
  <string id="30690" soundid="100938">The first thing to know is that this arena was founded under the auspices of Sagacious Tien himself. The Emperor&apos;s blessings rest upon this place as the one true test of martial skill in the Empire.</string>
  <string id="30691" soundid="100939">Interestingly, while we call it &quot;the arena&quot; commonly, its full name is &quot;The Trials of the Seven Gladiatorial Schools of Beneficent Light.&quot;</string>
  <string id="30692" soundid="100940">A bound volume of the finest parchment contains the arena&apos;s rules. This tome holds over three thousand rulings, the first dating back to the birth of the arena.</string>
  <string id="30693" soundid="100941">Besides the name being unwieldable by the tongue? Largely due to inaccuracy. There are far more than seven schools recognized across the Empire now.</string>
  <string id="30694" soundid="100942">Further, the Order of Beneficent Light disbanded hundreds of years ago. They are no longer the governing body of martial education, so these are not their trials anymore.</string>
  <string id="30695" soundid="100943">Still, we hold on to the name as a reminder of the glory days.</string>
  <string id="30696" soundid="100944">Many emperors have graced this place with their presence from a secure private viewing room.</string>
  <string id="30697" soundid="100945">When he was younger, Emperor Sun was a regular attendant, but I&apos;m sure the years have stolen away the time he once made for us.</string>
  <string id="30698" soundid="100946">No one knows them as well as I do, and that&apos;s likely for the better. Technically, we&apos;re supposed to lead a donkey around the fighting surface before each match.</string>
  <string id="30699" soundid="100947">I consider that to be one of the traditions best... overlooked. </string>
  <string id="30700" soundid="100948">Enough asses wander the streets around this building these days that I expect my predecessors&apos; spirits will be satisfied.</string>
  <string id="30702" soundid="100950">I must say, I&apos;m disappointed! You&apos;re ready to start your career, but you walk away. Insuspicious beginnings, my friend.</string>
  <string id="30703" soundid="100951">Be sure to return when you&apos;re ready to continue your climb through the qualifying round.</string>
  <string id="30704" soundid="100952">Do not be gone too long. Khana may well rise to become the Silver Division champion while you&apos;re away.</string>
  <string id="30705" soundid="100953">When you walk the streets and hear your name among the crowds, be sure that your ego does not swell like the body of Eleven Gaping Maw, god of inopportune gluttony.</string>
  <string id="30706" soundid="100954">Things are... interesting right now. Be as careful walking the streets as you are in the ring. I don&apos;t think Kai Lan is pleased with your progress.</string>
  <string id="30707" soundid="154011">There are few fates worse than being reduced to nothing. Lotus Assassins can belong nowhere else. Service to Death&apos;s Hand is your life.</string>
  <string id="30708" soundid="154012">Master Gang has been lax in indoctrinating you. No doubt he wants to make use of your fiery disposition before stripping you of it. You will come to understand.</string>
  <string id="30709" soundid="100957">Remember, the Serpent has asked to speak with you. It is best not to keep him waiting.</string>
  <string id="30718" soundid="100966">I apologize if I&apos;m using words beyond your grasp. Very few people can match either the supply or the command of my language.</string>
  <string id="30719" soundid="100967">Don&apos;t get flusterated. Everything I say is perfectly cromulent, and it might do you well to embiggen your vocabulary before you fling accretions my discretion.</string>
  <string id="30720" soundid="100968">A single glance tells me you are a remarkable woman with the perfect mix of strength and grace to grab a crowd&apos;s imagination!</string>
  <string id="30721" soundid="100969">A spirit of leaping flames dwells within you!</string>
  <string id="30722" soundid="100970">Strong build, good shoulders... not half bad looking, either. You&apos;ve got what it takes to make it in today&apos;s arena.</string>
  <string id="30723" soundid="100971">Livestock can be accordiated great value, but that&apos;s not the point here.</string>
  <string id="30724" soundid="100972">The question is, can you fight? Are you worthy of the arena? I say the answer is a clarion and resoundering, &quot;Yes!&quot;</string>
  <string id="30725" soundid="100973">In times like these, when even the Lotus Assassins can fall under attack, the people need something they can hold on to, something to soothe them.</string>
  <string id="30726" soundid="100974">Some might be suspicious of one seen publicly consorting with the Lotus Assassins, but I have no such qualms. You&apos;re as welcome here as the Emperor himself!</string>
  <string id="30728" soundid="138687">Of course. I was just thinking about things. Gao richly deserved his death, but I&apos;m not sure I ever really expected it to happen.</string>
  <string id="30729" soundid="100977">I&apos;ve heard that you were asking around and talking to some of our best and brightest. Your interest tells me all that I need to know about you.</string>
  <string id="30730" soundid="138688">Yes, I would welcome the chance.</string>
  <string id="30731" soundid="100979">I may not have heard your name before, but you walk like one who has seen many battles. You are indeed mysterious, stranger.</string>
  <string id="30732" soundid="100980">What say we get you signed up for the greatest attraction in all the Empire? The arena awaits!</string>
  <string id="30733" soundid="108306">[Failure] I don&apos;t see how balancing us against each other is productive.</string>
  <string id="30734" soundid="100982">Here you fight for silver; glory is yours for the taking if you value it. The rewards start small, but in the Gold Division you could easily retire on your winnings.</string>
  <string id="30735" soundid="100983">In fact, our last champion, Raging Ox, did just that. Suddenly up and left to enjoy his winnings, clearing the way for the Ravager to take his place.</string>
  <string id="30736" soundid="100984">You&apos;ll start low and advance on my say so, but I can already tell you&apos;re going to expel in this place. You&apos;ll not languish in the qualifiers for long.</string>
  <string id="30737" soundid="108307">Agreed. You are not giving much incentive for the continued... extra interest you have enjoyed.</string>
  <string id="30739">What is a Spirit Monk?</string>
  <string id="30740" soundid="108310">I... I did not think you would find the concern of your... closest friends trivial.</string>
  <string id="30741" soundid="108311">Yes, this is possibly the last we would see of you. If this is not appropriate now, when is it?</string>
  <string id="30742">&quot;Austi....&quot; Don&apos;t you mean, &quot;auspicious?&quot;</string>
  <string id="30743">Did you just butcher the language on purpose, or out of stupidity?</string>
  <string id="30744" soundid="108312">Thank you for your assurance. I know we have all been struggling with the responsibilities destiny imparts. I don&apos;t wish to add to that in an unpleasant way. </string>
  <string id="30745" soundid="108313">Yes, I can see how you would not want to be... overburdened. I think... I think we are done here.</string>
  <string id="30746" soundid="108314">Yes, Princess, I believe we are.</string>
  <string id="30747">If I joined the arena, who or what would I face?</string>
  <string id="30748" soundid="108315">Take care in the Assassins&apos; fortress. Master Li is waiting for us, and... I am looking forward to turning our attention to happier concerns.</string>
  <string id="30753" soundid="108319">It does.... Of course it does. I never had a doubt. I have asked a great deal from you, but I know you can provide more than I need.</string>
  <string id="30754" soundid="108320">Well, far be it from me to get in the way of what a princess needs. Whatever it is, I&apos;m sure it is far more important than what the... the rest of us want.</string>
  <string id="30755" soundid="108321">I think we are done here. I trust you will be careful as you progress from here. You must expose Death&apos;s Hand and save your Master.</string>
  <string id="30756" soundid="108322">And when all this is done, we can deal with more pleasant concerns.</string>
  <string id="30758" soundid="108324">I see. Well, if silence is what you want, I&apos;m sure that can be arranged.</string>
  <string id="30759" soundid="108325">Y-yes, it certainly can. I&apos;m sorry I was nothing more than... a distraction.</string>
  <string id="30760" soundid="108326">Be careful inside. There are still a great many people depending on you to discredit Death&apos;s Hand.</string>
  <string id="30761" soundid="108327">Even if they cannot depend on you in all things.</string>
  <string id="30762" soundid="154013">Soon you will have nothing else but your life here. Your role as a Lotus Assassin leaves no room for anything other than loyalty to Death&apos;s Hand and the Emperor.</string>
  <string id="30764">Are these fights deadly?</string>
  <string id="30767">What happened twenty years ago?</string>
  <string id="30768">What if someone specifically tries to dispel the protections?</string>
  <string id="30770">Let&apos;s go back to my other questions about the rules.</string>
  <string id="30771">I want to join the arena.</string>
  <string id="30772" soundid="154014">Slaves continue to be brought to the fortress from the Wall and unimportant villages that have no voice to object. Our golem force continues to grow.</string>
  <string id="30773">I am called &lt;FullName&gt;.</string>
  <string id="30776">I would rather keep that to myself.</string>
  <string id="30778">I am Egregious Prevaricator, respected scholar and grower of pipe weed. I&apos;m shocked you haven&apos;t heard of me.</string>
  <string id="30780">I want to be called Raging Dragon.</string>
  <string id="30781">Yes, that&apos;s what I want.</string>
  <string id="30782">Bill me as Silver Phoenix.</string>
  <string id="30783">Yes, that&apos;s what I want.</string>
  <string id="30784">Call me Tiger Lifts the Mountain.</string>
  <string id="30785">Yes, that&apos;s what I want.</string>
  <string id="30788">That&apos;s all I need to know?</string>
  <string id="30789">I&apos;ve got it. Let&apos;s get started.</string>
  <string id="30793">Tell me about my first fight.</string>
  <string id="30794">No, I&apos;ve changed my mind.</string>
  <string id="30795" soundid="154015">Operations in Tien&apos;s Landing have temporarily halted, but we received glorious news that a hated enemy of the Emperor has been delivered to the palace!</string>
  <string id="30796">I&apos;m not interested in the arena. I should talk to someone else.</string>
  <string id="30799" soundid="35966">I hear you&apos;re doing well in the arena, though I doubt you&apos;ve impressed the Ravager.</string>
  <string id="30800" soundid="35967">So, you have won honor in the arena. That&apos;s very good for someone who is... new to fighting.</string>
  <string id="30801" soundid="35968">The arena can be very dangerous, especially if you are unprepared.</string>
  <string id="30802" soundid="35969">If you&apos;re going to do well in the arena you&apos;ll need strength and luck. Lots of luck.</string>
  <string id="30803" soundid="35970">If I catch my husband betting at the arena again he&apos;ll have a *real* fight on his hands.</string>
  <string id="30804" soundid="35971">Oh good, another fighter. Just what this city needs, more fighters.</string>
  <string id="30805" soundid="35972">I don&apos;t know what&apos;s worse, the Outlander&apos;s noisy weapon or his loud mouth.</string>
  <string id="30806" soundid="35973">The Outlander reminds me of my first husband. Perhaps he&apos;ll disappear, as well.</string>
  <string id="31092">Tell me more about Kai Lan the Serpent.</string>
  <string id="31097">Henpecked Hou&apos;s wife finally tracked him down and brought him back home to settle back into the simple bun master&apos;s life. A few years later, he became a father for the first time. Though having septuplets at his age was not unheard of, having seven daughters at once was a bit peculiar. Shortly thereafter, Hou became deathly ill after accidentally eating a bun he intended to give to his wife. Hou&apos;s wife invited her entire family to live with them while he was bedridden. Hou recovered more quickly than expected, but word of his poisonous bun made sure that his career as a bun master was over. Instead, Hou became a delivery man, delivering packages throughout the Empire. He has yet to return from his first delivery.</string>
  <string id="31145">The Black Whirlwind accepted a job hunting demons for the Celestial Bureaucracy, but the ensuing red tape frustrated him so much that he gave up and made for the Mysterious East. Shortly thereafter, the Empire received a great influx of Outlanders, many of whom were missing limbs and other body parts. He returned to the Jade Empire several years later, but this time he came from the west. He couldn&apos;t explain how he did it, but he was the only person unsurprised to arrive back where he started. Expressing a newfound hatred for a people who couldn&apos;t make a decent bowl of wine, the Black Whirlwind vowed to never again leave the Jade Empire. A week later, he got bored and headed off to the north.</string>

  <string id="31302">Why do you let Lucky Cho push you around, Qui?</string>
  <string id="31304" soundid="158228">It would be an honor to say that I aided someone who was greeted by Princess Sun Lian herself!</string>
  <string id="31306">Enough about what Lucky Cho said. Can you tell me more about the Guild?</string>
  <string id="31309">I&apos;ll be careful who I talk to.</string>
  <string id="31311">They sound like a gang of common thugs. I should turn them in!</string>
  <string id="31314">I&apos;ll discuss what I want with whoever I want. They cannot touch me.</string>
  <string id="31325">Hold on, Qui! How do you know the Black Whirlwind?</string>
  <string id="31326">You&apos;re friends with the lummox who won&apos;t stop following me, I take it?</string>
  <string id="31338">I hope this proves my skill to you.</string>
  <string id="31340">What did he want to talk about?</string>
  <string id="31342">He&apos;ll have to wait, I&apos;m ready for my next match now.</string>
  <string id="31348">The crowd loved that fight. I think it was worth some extra silver, don&apos;t you?</string>
  <string id="31349">[Charm] You&apos;re too savvy a businessman to not reward your star performers.</string>
  <string id="31351">[Intimidation] I make it easier for you to fill the seats. That means nothing to you?</string>
  <string id="31354">Forget it. Let me ask you something instead.</string>
  <string id="31355">I should ask you about some things.</string>
  <string id="31359">What about the protective spells? Were they removed as well?</string>
  <string id="31361">How can I trust you? You&apos;re Kai Lan&apos;s man, aren&apos;t you?</string>
  <string id="31364">You&apos;re sure they won&apos;t try something like this again?</string>
  <string id="31365">How can I trust the Guild? Weren&apos;t they behind this?</string>
  <string id="31369">The last time I met someone down there it ended poorly.</string>
  <string id="31370">Did he say what he wants?</string>
  <string id="31371">I don&apos;t want to talk to that arrogant cur.</string>
  <string id="31374">The crowd loved that fight. I think we need to talk about some extra silver.</string>
  <string id="31375">[Intimidation] Pay me now so I don&apos;t demand that you up the payments on every fight.</string>
  <string id="31377">[Intuition] Would Soldier have let such a fight go without being paid extra?</string>
  <string id="31380">Very well, let me ask you something, then.</string>
  <string id="31381">I have some questions for you.</string>
  <string id="31385">I deserve more silver than this.</string>
  <string id="31386">[Intimidation] You can&apos;t afford to lose me, Qui. The crowds demand to see my matches.</string>
  <string id="31389">[Intuition] You&apos;ve said yourself that this division is a test for me. Surely the rules are less strict here. </string>
  <string id="31392">Very well, let me ask you something, then.</string>
  <string id="31393">I have some questions for you.</string>
  <string id="31394" soundid="103036">You will be the first. As I said, I *need* you to have the crowd&apos;s heart. Kai Lan does not want you to face the Ravager. I do.</string>
  <string id="31397">How can he be so strong?</string>
  <string id="31407" soundid="103041">It is that time. The Ravager awaits. You remember what I told you about fighting him?</string>
  <string id="31408" soundid="103042">I merely want you to think of your safety. The Ravager strikes with such power that even the wards of this arena may not be able to save you.</string>
  <string id="31409" soundid="103043">Your match could end in death. It almost happened when Sung Bu faced him alone, and he was the last opponent to tackle the champion.</string>
  <string id="31410" soundid="103044">The Ravager grows more fierce with each fight, as if time were making him stronger. If you face him, we may not be able to end the match in time.</string>
  <string id="31411" soundid="103045">Can I assist you with anything else?</string>
  <string id="31418">Now that I know what I&apos;m facing, I will crush your little pet!</string>
  <string id="31420">I&apos;m right here, don&apos;t talk around me as if I&apos;m not.</string>
  <string id="31422">Perhaps I lost on purpose. I don&apos;t appreciate someone suggesting that I should win.</string>
  <string id="31424">I look forward to the rematch.</string>

It is impossible for larger vessels to navigate, essentailly cutting off the town from the trade that sustains it. Minister Sheng in the town square can provide more details.</string>

  <string id="31530">A fast character may not be the strongest, but she can maintain Focus in battle longer than others, easily sidestepping strikes and delivering counterattacks with blinding speed.</string>
  <string id="31531">Though not as physically strong as others, a magical character is the best at channeling her Chi to enhance her physical strikes and fuel powerful elemental magics.</string>
  <string id="31532">A fast character may not be the strongest, but he can maintain Focus in battle longer than others, easily sidestepping strikes and delivering counterattacks with blinding speed.</string>
  <string id="31533">While not the fastest or strongest of warriors, the balanced character is the most versatile. The balanced character excels at adapting to exploit his enemies&apos; weaknesses.</string>
  <string id="31534">A strong character trades speed and magical aptitude for raw strength and power, enabling him to dish out and withstand much more damage than other warriors.</string>

  <string id="31596">Pleasing the peasants and the director is all well and good, but Incisive Chorus was unpleased with your rendition of the altered script. He stormed off without paying you his reward.</string>
  <string id="31597" soundid="149847">I will never believe it until I hear it from her own lips! And if she&apos;s that close, you can bet my hands will be around her neck!</string>
  <string id="31598" soundid="149848">Bring her here to me. Let me have my revenge.</string>
  <string id="31600" soundid="149849">My wife decided I wasn&apos;t good enough. She poisoned my food one day and left me to die, choking on my own swollen tongue.</string>
  <string id="31603" soundid="149850">Likely she has taken all I owned and sold it, lining her own pockets and finding some younger, more fit man to satisfy her.</string>
  <string id="31610" soundid="37050">Couldn&apos;t handle the stupidest ogre in the Empire, huh? Word gets around fast here.</string>
  <string id="31611" soundid="37051">Not even if it offers you a chance at the Bronze Division championship?</string>
  <string id="31613" soundid="37053">I will not tolerate mindless insults. My services are in high demand for tasks more important than this.</string>
  <string id="31614">This follower is missing.</string>
  <string id="31615" soundid="37055">Crimson Khana&apos;s rise to Bronze Division champion has been good for business, but she has become troublesome of late.</string>
  <string id="31616" soundid="37056">She believes that the Serpent runs the arena with little concern for honor, and she&apos;s right. The problem is that she cares. </string>
  <string id="31617" soundid="37057">This place is not corrupt so much as... open to interpretation.</string>
  <string id="31618" soundid="37058">The Serpent and I believe that Khana needs to be stopped. We want you to replace her as the Bronze champion.</string>
  <string id="31620" soundid="37060">It should be a simple matter to slip a slow-acting, but extremely deadly, poison into Khana&apos;s drink before the match.</string>
  <string id="31621" soundid="109413">So, your lost sheep, Sagacious Zu, returned to save you. I didn&apos;t think he had the nerve.</string>
  <string id="31623" soundid="109414">That&apos;s because people are nothing but tools to you!</string>
  <string id="31624" soundid="37064">If you accept, the Guild will cover half of Lyn&apos;s usual fee. The remaining cost would be roughly half of your winnings from defeating Khana.</string>
  <string id="31625" soundid="37065">If you&apos;re that sure, why are we still talking? You want to cheat for the thrills?</string>
  <string id="31626" soundid="37066">[Success] You&apos;re going to make this difficult unless I make this easy, aren&apos;t you?</string>
  <string id="31627" soundid="37067">[Failure] This benefits you more than us. Others would leap at this opportunity. The price remains fixed.</string>
  <string id="31628" soundid="37068">Will you go ahead with this? Do you have the will to take your advantage?</string>
  <string id="31629" soundid="37069">Do you want to go ahead with this or not?</string>
  <string id="31630" soundid="37070">Excellent. Your payment will be reduced for Khana&apos;s match, but I&apos;m sure Qui knows better than to ask too many questions.</string>
  <string id="31631" soundid="37071">Khana will prove an easy foe under the influence of my concoction. Simply wait her out, if you wish.</string>
  <string id="31633" soundid="37073">You fool. The Guild *is* the authority in the arena. Anyone you approach would know better than to tangle with us.</string>
  <string id="31634" soundid="37074">If that is your choice, then so be it. You may deal with Khana on your own.</string>
  <string id="31635" soundid="37075">I strongly advise you not to bring this up to anyone. I hope my point speaks for itself.</string>
  <string id="31636" soundid="37076">Our business is concluded. It is time for you to leave.</string>
  <string id="31637" soundid="37077">Don&apos;t expect a hearty round of congratulations for defeating Han. There are trained apes in the Emperor&apos;s menagerie who could sit that one down.</string>
  <string id="31638" soundid="37078">Do not hover around me like a curious dragonfly. People will be suspicious enough when they see Khana in the ring.</string>
  <string id="31644">Bandit</string>
  <string id="31648" soundid="37088">It seems our little arrangement worked out extremely well. Be sure to keep quiet about it, if you value your own reputation.</string>
  <string id="31649" soundid="37089">I am always watching, even you dogs in the qualifying rounds. Remember that.</string>
  <string id="31650" soundid="37090">Now that you&apos;re not fighting with the trained apes, the bets placed on you will actually be worth the time they take to process.</string>
  <string id="31651" soundid="37091">With Crimson Khana out of the way, my job is going to be much easier.</string>
  <string id="31653" soundid="37093">What do you want?</string>
  <string id="31656" soundid="37096">Yes. I know that they scout among the highly skilled fighters.</string>
  <string id="31657" soundid="37097">They usually only watch those fighting well above you, so if you have hopes of joining their ranks, I suggest you practice.</string>
  <string id="31658" soundid="109415">My dear little Dawn Star. I&apos;m a princess. People bow to me. That is the way things are. </string>
  <string id="31659" soundid="109416">Of course, many things are not as I thought they were, if what we learned from Jia is true.</string>
  <string id="31660" soundid="109417">I know what you found and what the implications of it are: The Emperor himself ordered the golems constructed, and... the workers were stolen from their homes.</string>
  <string id="31661" soundid="109418">By the Water Dragon&apos;s mercy, they are enslaved until they die... and then trapped within the golems. I have seen the proof... but how can it be true?</string>
  <string id="31664" soundid="138634">Suppose you were a young noble who has just inherited a fortune.</string>
  <string id="31665" soundid="37105">If you want to bother someone with inane queries, I suggest you speak with Qui the Promoter about the arena or the tavern keeper about the city.</string>
  <string id="31666" soundid="37106">Those two will have more than enough time to waste on you, I am sure. Now, was there something important you needed to ask?</string>
  <string id="31677" soundid="37117">Good. Only come to me when you have business to conduct. I am not here to debate philosophy or discuss the conditions of the weather.</string>
  <string id="31678" soundid="37118">You&apos;re the one Qui found to fill the roster? He must have been desperate.</string>
  <string id="31679" soundid="37119">Every time an event like the arena occurs, some people enjoy adding a certain edge to the proceedings.</string>
  <string id="31680" soundid="37120">When those people feel like investing in a particular fighter&apos;s chances, Lucky Cho is the man they want to see.</string>
  <string id="31681" soundid="37121">No. You&apos;re a fighter, you can&apos;t bet on the matches.</string>
  <string id="31682" soundid="37122">Watch that barbed tongue of yours. It could come back to snag you.</string>
  <string id="31692" soundid="37132">Before you face Khana, I&apos;d like to present you with a mutually beneficial arrangement.</string>
  <string id="31693">Bet Taker</string>
  <string id="31694" soundid="37134">This is Sweet Poison Lyn, a master of the toxicant arts.</string>
  <string id="31696" soundid="37136">Lyn, this is Raging Dragon, the fighter we discussed.</string>
  <string id="31697" soundid="37137">Sweet Poison, standing before you is Silver Phoenix, the one we discussed.</string>
  <string id="31698" soundid="37138">Lyn, allow me to introduce Tiger Lifts the Mountain.</string>

  <string id="31706">Why is this foul poisoner here?</string>
  <string id="31708" soundid="109423">No! I will not believe it! We have to go to the palace and give him the chance to explain.</string>
  <string id="31710">What does this have to do with me?</string>
  <string id="31711">She is a fool if she thinks something this large would not be corrupt.</string>
  <string id="31713" soundid="109424">Stand beside me or don&apos;t. I am going to question my father and straighten this out. It&apos;s all just a mistake.</string>
  <string id="31714">Go on.</string>
  <string id="31715">I was wondering when you would come to the point.</string>
  <string id="31716">I will not be party to a murder.</string>
  <string id="31717" soundid="109425">We must be on our guard. Is there another way to reach the palace? The princess doesn&apos;t want to see the danger.</string>
  <string id="31719" soundid="109426">She says she can get my Marvelous Dragonfly there in one piece. I have heard no other options, and I won&apos;t risk the finish flying blind.</string>
  <string id="31720">That is too much silver for something I could do on my own.</string>
  <string id="31721">[Charm] This is mutually beneficial. Why worry about silver?</string>
  <string id="31722">[Intimidation] How big are the bets on this match? Can you afford leaving it to chance?</string>
  <string id="31725">Forget lowering the cost.</string>
  <string id="31726">Let&apos;s do it. Poison her and take the silver from my winnings.</string>
  <string id="31731">What if I tell the authorities about this?</string>
  <string id="31732">I will not dishonor myself by resorting to poison.</string>
  <string id="31740" soundid="107777">I think you&apos;ll be able to handle yourself, but I&apos;m not holding back out there.</string>
  <string id="31745" soundid="58472">From what I hear, you and I will meet next. I&apos;m really looking forward to it.</string>
  <string id="31746" soundid="105623">Still a mouth on you. I like that. You&apos;re going to do fine.</string>
  <string id="31747" soundid="58474">We&apos;ll take care of that in the next match, new blood, trust me. I&apos;ve been looking forward to taking you down a notch.</string>

  <string id="31761" soundid="160266">The only real visitor we ever have is that strange fellow who came in for supplies once or twice. He&apos;s just some mad hermit, though. He tries to avoid the village proper.</string>
  <string id="31762" soundid="109430">I thank you, but this has been a great deal to absorb. I don&apos;t know what to think about anything.</string>
  <string id="31763" soundid="109431">We still have much to talk about, but it will have to wait. I must speak to my father. Forgive me.</string>

  <string id="31778">I don&apos;t need anything else from you.</string>
  <string id="31779">Is there any way I can participate?</string>

  <string id="32568" soundid="86717">Do you still feel the same way for your Heavenly Lily?</string>
  <string id="32571" soundid="86720">I haven&apos;t slept since you fell. For all the influence my position is supposed to carry, I was as helpless as a lamb.</string>
  <string id="32572" soundid="86721">But now, to have you back here, with me. It&apos;s almost too much to bear.</string>
  <string id="32573" soundid="86722">I wish that saying it would make it true, but there is so much that is uncertain.</string>
  <string id="32574" soundid="86723">Whatever comes tomorrow, thank you for what we have *right now.* This moment... is beautiful.</string>
  <string id="32575" soundid="86724">You should kiss me before I remember who I am supposed to be.</string>
  <string id="32577" soundid="86726">Do you remember the hearts you left behind? I am not the only one waiting for an answer.</string>
  <string id="32580" soundid="86729">If you had to make a choice between me and her... would you? Could you? Who would it be?</string>
  <string id="32581" soundid="86730">Ah, it&apos;s just as we suspected. It&apos;s a shame, really.</string>
  <string id="32583" soundid="86731">A decision of one or the other can&apos;t help but hurt someone. We agreed that we wouldn&apos;t let that happen. Not after sharing such grief.</string>
  <string id="32584" soundid="86732">I should go.</string>
  <string id="32593" soundid="138459">The Imperial City is beautiful, but you still have to be careful in certain areas.</string>
  <string id="32594" soundid="86734">Ahhh... it&apos;s just like we thought. Poor, poor, lovable man, caught by feelings he can&apos;t stop.</string>
  <string id="32597" soundid="196989"></string>
  <string id="32598" soundid="86735">I never imagined that I&apos;d love someone like you....</string>
  <string id="32599" soundid="138460">Emperor Sun Hai is a great man. Without him the Empire would still be living in a drought.</string>
  <string id="32602" soundid="86739">Your... death, left us shaken. It seemed like an eternity before Dawn Star had that vision of the Water Dragon... before we knew you might return.</string>
  <string id="32603" soundid="86740">We consoled each other. Dawn Star and I started talking... got to know each other better.</string>
  <string id="32609">The Executioner</string>
  <string id="32637">That depends. Is she still willing to take what makes her happy?</string>
  <string id="32639">I haven&apos;t been able to stop thinking of you.</string>
  <string id="32642">I&apos;ll never let you go again.</string>
  <string id="32653" soundid="138461">I&apos;ve seen some strange things in this city, but it&apos;s still the only place I&apos;d want to live.</string>
  <string id="32654" soundid="138462">I love shopping in the city. They have everything here.</string>
  <string id="32657">If it&apos;s too much, I could leave again. Not by the same method, I hope.</string>
  <string id="32659">I don&apos;t understand. what have you been up to?</string>
  <string id="32662">I&apos;d choose you, Sun Lian.</string>
  <string id="32663">I&apos;d have to choose Dawn Star. I am sorry.</string>

  <string id="33231" soundid="39184">What is it you wish to know?</string>
  <string id="33232" soundid="39185">I&apos;m afraid I don&apos;t know, honored stranger. You should speak with Lishun the Talkative. If anyone would know the tale, he would.</string>
  <string id="33233" soundid="39186">You could probably find him wandering around the town somewhere, wasting time and looking for people willing to listen to his stories.</string>
  <string id="33238">Lotus Assassin</string>
  <string id="33241" soundid="39194">If you go around the side of the teahouse, you&apos;ll see a path leading up to the town square, the highest point in Tien&apos;s Landing.</string>
  <string id="33242" soundid="39195">Minister Sheng is the duly appointed minister for this region. He is trying to hold the town together as well as he can, but it is not easy.</string>
  <string id="33254">Lotus Elite</string>
  <string id="33257">Lotus Elite</string>
  <string id="33283" soundid="39236">He&apos;s probably in the teahouse right behind me. Even with things as bad as they are, Ru isn&apos;t the type to miss out on his drinking.</string>
  <string id="33284" soundid="39237">He was in the teahouse, getting drunk. But he staggered out some time ago. I think he was heading towards Beggar&apos;s Pier, near the waterfront.</string>
  <string id="33285" soundid="39238">Of course, great one. I would be honored to answer whatever questions you may have.</string>
  <string id="33286" soundid="39239">I am poor, honored one. I do not know how my few pitiful coins can help you. Besides, I need them for myself.</string>
  <string id="33289" soundid="39242">[Success] I do... yes, of course. How can I ever complain about anything if I don&apos;t do my part? Take my silver; you can do more for the town with it than I can.</string>
  <string id="33290" soundid="39243">[Failure] As much as I want to help, I can&apos;t just give you all my silver. Surely you understand that, honored stranger?</string>
  <string id="33291" soundid="39244">[Success] Please don&apos;t hurt me, great one! I&apos;m just a poor peasant woman. I can&apos;t resist you. Take my silver, take everything I have. Just don&apos;t hurt me!</string>
  <string id="33294" soundid="39247">I am relieved to hear it! Is there anything else I can do for you?</string>
  <string id="33296" soundid="39249">Take care of yourself, stranger, and be glad that you do not live in Tien&apos;s Landing </string>
  <string id="33297" soundid="39250">Goodbye, great one. It is always a pleasure speaking with you, the hero of Tien&apos;s Landing.</string>
  <string id="33303" soundid="117583">This is bad. Oh, this is bad. River dried up, pirates everywhere. This is worse than the Long Drought.</string>
  <string id="33305">Who are you?</string>
  <string id="33307">Why do you wish that?</string>
  <string id="33337">Why is this town called Tien&apos;s Landing?</string>
  <string id="33344">Where can I buy and sell things?</string>
  <string id="33349">Who&apos;s in charge here?</string>
  <string id="33363" soundid="117584">If you want to listen in, fine. But pipe down, or you&apos;ll make me lose my place. Now, where was I... Oh, yeah! You don&apos;t know anything. You said the Emperor would save us!</string>
  <string id="33364" soundid="117585">How do you know he didn&apos;t?</string>
  <string id="33365" soundid="117586">I know it wasn&apos;t the Emperor because it was some stranger who wandered into town, closed the dam, and saved us.</string>
  <string id="33389" soundid="124097"></string>
  <string id="33391">Where can I find Ru the Boatswain?</string>
  <string id="33394">I want to ask you some questions.</string>
  <string id="33397">[Intuition] Tien&apos;s Landing is your home. Don&apos;t you care about it?</string>
  <string id="33398">[Intimidation] Give me your silver! The greater good demands it!</string>
  <string id="33401">Gao&apos;s Mercenary</string>
  <string id="33403">You&apos;re right. Keep your silver.</string>
  <string id="33407">Does this have any practical effect?</string>
  <string id="33410">I want to ask about someone specific.</string>
  <string id="33411" soundid="128612">Though I fell for your deception and that of the other Lotus Assassins, I am no ignorant beast! I am a Guardian, bound to protect the treasures of this place.</string>
  <string id="33412" soundid="128613">I failed when I allowed your master to steal the amulet from me, but I will not fail again! You will never escape with the gem!</string>

  <string id="33421">Don&apos;t Explode</string>
  <string id="33459" soundid="39503">You won&apos;t get too far if you don&apos;t speak to Minister Sheng first. The dam is located in the ruins, but a pair of massive gates blocks the way. Only Sheng has the key.</string>
  <string id="33461" soundid="39505">He&apos;s in the town square. You&apos;ll see him standing in front of a cart. Just don&apos;t ask him about the burned-out building nearby.</string>
  <string id="33462" soundid="39506">Excellent. The key will get you into the ruins, where you can close the Great Dam. I hope to see the water rising soon.</string>
  <string id="33463" soundid="39507">Good luck. I am not used to needing help from others. It is hard for me to say this, but... thank you.</string>
  <string id="33476">Where do I find Minister Sheng?</string>
  <string id="33478">I&apos;ve already got the key from Sheng.</string>
  <string id="33480">I&apos;ll be back once the dam is closed and the river is not so low and fast.</string>

  <string id="33497">Follow Spy</string>
  <string id="33498">Follow SumYungGuy on his patrol route as he checks up on the bomb. Then defuse it.</string>
  <string id="33499">oohhh Sneaky you are! Defuse the bomb you must!</string>
  <string id="33500">Be a retard</string>
  <string id="33501">Just run around screaming &quot;WTF!?!!?!? Where is the bomb!?!?!&quot;</string>
  <string id="33502">Yer an Idiot.</string>
  <string id="33503" soundid="39903"></string>
  <string id="33504" soundid="39904">Jiang, this is it. Time for your reward.</string>
  <string id="33505" soundid="39905">What are you talking about, Captain? My success in business is reward enough for me.</string>
  <string id="33507" soundid="39907"></string>
  <string id="33508" soundid="39908">What just happened here? I saw the end of the fight, but not the beginning. Who attacked first?</string>
  <string id="33509" soundid="39909">No. But you must tell me what happened here. Did this man kill in self defense, or was it murder?</string>
  <string id="33510" soundid="39910">Wait, do not implicate yourself to save me. Guard, I attacked Merchant Jiang in a drunken attempt to salvage my pride. How did I think this would make me feel better?</string>
  <string id="33511" soundid="39911">It is true! Guard, I attacked Merchant Jiang in a drunken attempt to salvage my pride. How did I think this would make me feel better?</string>
  <string id="33512" soundid="39912">You are going to have to come with me.</string>
  <string id="33513" soundid="39913"></string>
  <string id="33515" soundid="39915">[Failure] No, that will change nothing.</string>
  <string id="33516" soundid="39916">Merchant! Bring me more wine!</string>
  <string id="33517" soundid="39917">Good, I have drinking to do.</string>
  <string id="33530" soundid="105444">I hope you were not injured in the bandit attack. You fought bravely from what I hear.</string>
  <string id="33531" soundid="39579">True, if the Great Dam remains open, the town will consolidate a bit. That might be a good thing. Either way, the smart ones who planned for their future will be fine.</string>
  <string id="33532" soundid="39580">If you are going out there anyway, I would rather you consider how you can profit from the experience. *You* will be putting your life in danger. Shouldn&apos;t you be rewarded?</string>
  <string id="33533" soundid="39581">Now we come to the heart of it. I need something done, and I will not ask for favors, or beg for help. I believe that everything has a value, and I place a value on your actions.</string>
  <string id="33537">Exit Tunnel</string>
  <string id="33538">Master Gang</string>
  <string id="33540">Ghost Trouble</string>
  <string id="33542" soundid="39590">If you&apos;ll excuse me, I have many customers. I try to provide good service, so I must be about my business.</string>
  <string id="33544" soundid="39592">If the Great Dam closes, the water level rises and those sailors will float away with all their silver. It would be a ridiculous waste of a golden business opportunity.</string>
  <string id="33550">Merchant Kia Jong</string>
  <string id="33551">Merchant Kia Jong</string>

  <string id="33561" soundid="39614">Oh, trust me, you have it at all times.</string>
  <string id="33562" soundid="39615">You handled yourself well against the demonic servitor. It was a rewarding experience for us both, I&apos;m sure. Take this as my thanks.</string>
  <string id="33563" soundid="39616">Your inability to deal with the minor demon cost me dearly. I expected more from you, but I am prepared to overlook your weakness, for the moment.</string>
  <string id="33564" soundid="39617">You are a smart young woman--smart enough to know that you will get much further as my friend than my foe. </string>
  <string id="33565" soundid="39618">You are a young man, but I know you have the wisdom to see that my friendship has... advantages.</string>
  <string id="33566" soundid="39619">You may find that certain opportunities, mutually rewarding arrangements between us, will come your way in the near future. </string>
  <string id="33567" soundid="39620">&quot;Cheat&quot; is such a pedestrian term. I prefer to think of myself as a creative engineer.</string>
  <string id="33568" soundid="39621">Like the fountains that channel water throughout the land, I spread entertainment to the people.</string>
  <string id="33569" soundid="39622">Good. I enjoy discussions with sensible people.</string>
  <string id="33570" soundid="39623">Indeed. Of course, every match you face in the arena has you working for me, whether you realize it or not.</string>
  <string id="33571" soundid="39624">Then you live in an amusing fantasy. Do say hello to the fox spirits and the twin dragons of heaven for me. When you have them over for tea, that is.</string>
  <string id="33572" soundid="39625">There is the matter, however, of your friend, Whirlwind. I&apos;m sure you know that he was one of the fighters here and that he left the arena, but do you know why?</string>
  <string id="33573" soundid="39626">He has good reason not to tell you about this part of his admittedly spotty past.</string>
  <string id="33574" soundid="39627">Useful, but dangerous.</string>
  <string id="33575" soundid="39628">How perceptive of you.</string>
  <string id="33576" soundid="39629">Whirlwind&apos;s past is certainly a colorful one. Did he tell you that he was thrown out of the arena?</string>
  <string id="33577" soundid="39630">We couldn&apos;t let him fight as he was, so he left. His brother, Raging Ox, wisely stayed here and went on to become champion.</string>
  <string id="33578" soundid="39631">You could reach that point yourself, you know. Indeed, that&apos;s a distinct possibility.</string>
  <string id="33579" soundid="39632">Hey! You can&apos;t...</string>
  <string id="33580" soundid="39633">We&apos;re leaving, now. You and I have to talk. Alone. It&apos;s important.</string>
  <string id="33581" soundid="142074">Ha! That got the blood moving. You&apos;re trying to bait me into a rumble, but it&apos;s not going to work. Years of being grumpy don&apos;t leave much room for proper anger any more.</string>
  <string id="33582" soundid="142075">What did you want, anyway? And make it snappy! At my age I could die at the drop of a blossom.</string>

  <string id="33587" soundid="105509">You&apos;d think the recent attack would have people buying supplies or weapons or something, but alas, business has not improved.</string>
  <string id="33588" soundid="142495">Try Lin, she&apos;ll say anything to please you just to see your simpering little smile. Pathetic.</string>
  <string id="33589" soundid="105511">Lieutenant, you are in charge while I go up to the Great Dam and check on the sentry golems. If anyone tries to enter these ruins, kill them.</string>
  <string id="33590" soundid="105512">Of course, dread one.</string>
  <string id="33592" soundid="154990">You have your orders! No one can enter the ruins. Kill the intruder!</string>
  <string id="33594" soundid="154992">You&apos;ll want to talk to Spear Catches Leaf, he&apos;s Lord Yun&apos;s man. I&apos;m just the hired mercenary.</string>
  <string id="33596">Speak with Zin Bu to enter his store. 

Zin Bu the Magic Abacus is a celestial bureaucrat who seeks to shift over to sales. Check back often; his magical store occasionally restocks itself to help you on your journey. </string>
  <string id="33599" soundid="154996">Thank you... thank you so much. I&apos;ll take you to them. Follow me.</string>
  <string id="33601">I&apos;d like to repay you, but I appear to have spent most of it.</string>
  <string id="33614">New Guy</string>
  <string id="33620" soundid="105542">Idiot! He&apos;s obviously a spy! Kill him!</string>
  <string id="33621" soundid="105543">Who are you? How did you get in here?</string>
  <string id="33624" soundid="127797">I hear strange sounds coming from the ruins at night. They say it&apos;s ghosts, but I don&apos;t believe that!</string>
  <string id="33625" soundid="39678">If you have even the tiniest bit of sense, Whirlwind, you&apos;ll realize that you should thank me.</string>
  <string id="33626" soundid="39679">What... have you done to my brother?</string>
  <string id="33627" soundid="39680">Your brother was a useful tool. After you cut him down while he defended me, I decided it would be too much bother to let him go. In the process, I saved you from charges of fratricide.</string>
  <string id="33628" soundid="39681">And so the Ravager was born. The perfect, unquestioning enforcer of my will, and I owe it all to you, Whirlwind.</string>
  <string id="33629" soundid="39682">I should kill you here and now, but first....</string>
  <string id="33630" soundid="39683">I invoke the right of challenge! As an ex-champion, I will return and stake my claim upon this place. Tradition supports my right to this!</string>
  <string id="33631" soundid="39684">But... the right of challenge hasn&apos;t been used in hundreds of years!</string>
  <string id="33632" soundid="39685">Very well. You need not accept the precedents and traditions that make this Empire great, Qui.</string>
  <string id="33633" soundid="39686">Instead, accept that my men will kill you if you dare contradict me again.</string>
  <string id="33634" soundid="39687">So, stripling, what do you say? Are you prepared to suffer at my hands, or will you walk away and die the tenfold deaths of the coward?</string>
  <string id="33635" soundid="39688">No! You are not the current champion, Serpent. My brother was, and now my friend is.</string>
  <string id="33636" soundid="39689">Allow me to accept his challenge on your behalf, Master. I will not fail you, and I know my brother&apos;s spirit will be satisfied if I take this chance.</string>
  <string id="33637" soundid="39690">Never! I will not allow a substitution of this sort!</string>
  <string id="33638" soundid="39691">Are you certain, Master? I wish nothing more than to avenge my brother.</string>
  <string id="33639" soundid="39692">Preposterous. This oaf can&apos;t fight for you.</string>
  <string id="33640" soundid="39693">They do have the right, Serpent. You substituted the demon in place of one of your Guild men. You set the precedent yourself.</string>
  <string id="33641" soundid="39694">Damn you all. Fine, I will fight the shaved bear. It will be a pleasure. Speak with Qui when you are ready. Until then, I will prepare.</string>
  <string id="33642" soundid="39695">When you put it that way, I suppose it makes sense. You go and do what you do best.</string>
  <string id="33643" soundid="39696">Deny me my vengeance. It&apos;s only my brother, after all.</string>
  <string id="33644" soundid="39697">I look forward to squeezing the last breath from your throat. Speak with Qui when you are ready; I will be prepared.</string>
  <string id="33645" soundid="39698">Unless you&apos;re smart enough to know when you are beaten. If so, take the wise man&apos;s path and simply walk away.</string>
  <string id="33646" soundid="39699">I have every right, and Qui will ensure that you are not acclaimed until I am satisfied.</string>
  <string id="33647" soundid="39700">I can... not fall like this. I....</string>
  <string id="33648" soundid="39701">You have done nothing.... I still took your brother... from you.</string>
  <string id="33649" soundid="39702">And I took him back and repaid the favor. Now hurry up and die, magician.</string>
  <string id="33650" soundid="105625">The Serpent&apos;s going to be upset at this change. I&apos;m sure things are going to get very interesting around here.</string>
  <string id="33651" soundid="108717">You&apos;re even and level headed, which means you won&apos;t watch your back. You&apos;ll never last.</string>
  <string id="33652" soundid="105627">I thought someone smart enough to &quot;deal&quot; with Khana like you did would have had the sense to work with me. You missed your chance at some extra silver like a fool.</string>
  <string id="33653" soundid="105628">Now my division&apos;s yours, but not for long, new meat. You&apos;ll be torn to shreds by the Sungs and all the other Gold round surprises.</string>
  <string id="33654">What did you want to see me about?</string>
  <string id="33656">I prefer to stand.</string>
  <string id="33658">You asked me to come. I am at least worth your full attention.</string>
  <string id="33664">If you&apos;re proposing I cheat or throw fights, I refuse.</string>
  <string id="33667">I&apos;m always interested in rewarding opportunities.</string>
  <string id="33669">I have no interest in working with you.</string>
  <string id="33671">What if I think I&apos;m the one who should be directing the events around here?</string>
  <string id="33673">I honestly don&apos;t know. He won&apos;t tell me.</string>
  <string id="33675">I don&apos;t really care. He&apos;s useful; that&apos;s all that&apos;s important.</string>
  <string id="33677">I expect the lout killed someone he shouldn&apos;t have. That seems his style.</string>
  <string id="33679">We all have a past. I wouldn&apos;t hold his against him.</string>
  <string id="33684" soundid="59879">The first change to the palace since the time of Sagacious Tien, in fact. That&apos;s a good reason to break with tradition, and one we all understood. </string>
  <string id="33685">Student</string>
  <string id="33691" soundid="127798">Tien&apos;s Landing has seen tough times, but we&apos;ve always pulled through. This town&apos;s spirit is strong.</string>
  <string id="33694" soundid="105556">Consider it a perfectly laid trap, not a weakness. Your master was truly skilled, to mold such a trap into your very being. It is odd he never mentioned it to you.</string>
  <string id="33696" soundid="105558">Sometimes the best masters dare not trust their students with the deepest mysteries. Certain lessons can only be learned if one discovers them for oneself.</string>
  <string id="33698" soundid="105560">I look forward to crossing paths with you. You and I both rose quickly through the ranks. The true test will be in which of us falls and how we handle it.</string>
  <string id="33700" soundid="105562">You are to face Hapless Han next, I hear. Do not underestimate him. His skills are not exceptional, but one cannot question his heart or his drive.</string>
  <string id="33702" soundid="105564">The Guild does not operate so overtly in the rest of the City. I wonder if the organization condones such actions. But such musings are useless. Why have you told me this?</string>
  <string id="33704" soundid="105566">A warrior knows that training is more valuable than silver.</string>
  <string id="33707">You are skilled indeed.</string>
  <string id="33709">I will discuss it with him.</string>
  <string id="33712">My master has many questions to answer when I find him.</string>
  <string id="33721" soundid="105629">And when you&apos;re beaten and tired and bloody, that&apos;s when I&apos;ll take my division back. Just wait and see.</string>
  <string id="33722" soundid="105630">Come over here, we&apos;ve got something to discuss!</string>
  <string id="33723" soundid="105631">You thought you could mess with Iron Soldier. Ha!</string>
  <string id="33724" soundid="105632">You learned your lesson, didn&apos;t you? You can&apos;t beat me. Very few people can in this entire Empire. You&apos;re welcome to try again, but no deal this time.</string>
  <string id="33728">You won&apos;t leave right away?</string>
  <string id="33734">What tradition is this?</string>
  <string id="33735">More cheap tricks? You&apos;re sinking to a new low.</string>
  <string id="33742">There have been other substitutions here, Kai Lan. Mine won&apos;t be the first.</string>
  <string id="33743">Calm down, Serpent, I will be facing you.</string>
  <string id="33744">On second thought, you will fight for me.</string>
  <string id="33747">I will be your agent in this.</string>
  <string id="33749">Frankly, I don&apos;t think you can beat him. I&apos;m not leaving my championship in your hands.</string>
  <string id="33752">You have no right to challenge me at all, Serpent.</string>
  <string id="33753">Then Black Whirlwind will have his vengeance.</string>
  <string id="33754">I will face you, then, when I am ready.</string>

  <string id="35038" soundid="132391">It could be Judge Fong. That would be bad. Or Judge Feng. That would be worse. Or maybe even... Judge Fyung!</string>
  <string id="35041" soundid="132392">Alas, Sheng is not so delusional as to believe in that outcome. Now, if you don&apos;t mind, I would prefer to ponder my fate without your whimsical interruptions.</string>
  <string id="35044" soundid="127011">You&apos;re back. Have you considered my offer? I&apos;m willing to pay you a large reward if you close the dam.</string>
  <string id="35045" soundid="127012">I wanted you to close the dam so I could take my ship and my men and leave this place. I&apos;m willing to pay you a substantial reward. Have you... reconsidered my offer?</string>
  <string id="35046" soundid="92115">Such disrespect. I never imagined my father would allow this to happen.</string>
  <string id="35047" soundid="92116">Such disrespect. This was done after Master Li ran from the Emperor, but he must have known it would be needed.</string>
  <string id="35048" soundid="92117">To show such disrespect... Where would they take the Empire from here?</string>
  <string id="35049" soundid="92118">Room had to be made. The old is cast aside.</string>
  <string id="35050" soundid="92119">Bah! Everyone knows corpses spoil water. It&apos;s nothing new.</string>
  <string id="35051" soundid="92120">The Jade Empire was built on tradition. I do not know this new land.</string>
  <string id="35052" soundid="132393">A statement rolled in the readily apparent and dipped in the blatantly obvious. If you don&apos;t mind, I would prefer to ponder my fate without your oh-so-helpful observations.</string>
  <string id="35053" soundid="132394">Have you... have you dealt with Judge Fang? Not that Minister Sheng wants to know anything about it, of course.</string>
  <string id="35054" soundid="92121">Chai Ka: A land is defined by the strength of its traditions. When those are gone, how do the people recognize it?</string>
  <string id="35055" soundid="92122">Ya Zhen: Useless decaying flesh. Mortals lose their appeal once the soul is no longer present to toy with.</string>
  <string id="35057" soundid="92123">What... have they done to this creature?</string>
  <string id="35058" soundid="92124">Such a brutal display. Now I truly know the depths to which my father went.</string>
  <string id="35059" soundid="92125">I have never seen such a sight. I never imagined....</string>
  <string id="35061" soundid="92126">Now *that* would have been something to fight.</string>
  <string id="35062" soundid="92127">Chai Ka: A horror beyond imagining, even beyond the realms of man.</string>
  <string id="35065" soundid="92128">Ya Zhen: An epic cruelty. I have never seen such a thing. Genius.</string>
  <string id="35082" soundid="132397">Of course. Say no more. The less Minister Sheng knows about this, the better. But... please hurry. </string>
  <string id="35083" soundid="132398">If you take too long, the Lotus Assassins might become nervous. I&apos;m afraid to think what they might do to me to calm their fears!</string>
  <string id="35084" soundid="132399">Judge Fang is probably over in the arena, watching the fights. Not that Minister Sheng said anything about that, of course!</string>
  <string id="35085" soundid="132400">But you... we had a... you can&apos;t... guards! Guards! Minister Sheng needs help!</string>
  <string id="35086">Fox Spirit</string>
  <string id="35087" soundid="92129">I... have seen enough. Time to go, yes? Please?</string>
  <string id="35088" soundid="92130">No!</string>
  <string id="35090" soundid="92131">This is... amazing. For such a creature to be mishandled so... the arrogance of the family Sun knows no bounds.</string>
  <string id="35091" soundid="92132">I have never seen such a crime against the proper order of things.</string>
  <string id="35093" soundid="92133">Such a clumsy means to power. They had to know this act would be punished.</string>
  <string id="35094" soundid="92134">Every freedom I cherish is violated by this.</string>
  <string id="35095" soundid="92135">There can be no doubt that this calls for vengeance.</string>
  <string id="35096" soundid="92136">As was commanded, the beast was cut open to sustain the Empire. For the good of all, the greatest evil.</string>
  <string id="35097" soundid="92137">Chai Ka: It is... the saddest violation of a gentle creature. When the makers fall... what then?</string>
  <string id="35098" soundid="92138">Ya Zhen: I marvel at the mind that came up with this. To cast his gaze so far above his station to his own makers is... admirable.</string>
  <string id="35099" soundid="92139">I&apos;m sure the battle against the beast was epic, but stringing up the fallen is not the warrior&apos;s way.</string>
  <string id="35100" soundid="132404">I can&apos;t leave the wonders of the Imperial City behind again. Not like this. I refuse to go back to Tien&apos;s Landing!</string>
  <string id="35101" soundid="92140">My eyes were not meant to see this.</string>
  <string id="35102" soundid="92141">There is no other reasonable response to such an abomination.</string>
  <string id="35103" soundid="132405">I will stay right here until Judge Fang returns to hear my report! Surely he can&apos;t hold a grudge forever... can he?</string>
  <string id="35104" soundid="132406">Minister Sheng is so pleased to be back in the Imperial City that he even forgives you for not closing the Great Dam back in Tien&apos;s Landing.</string>
  <string id="35105" soundid="92142">Such power wasted. No one involved deserved it.</string>
  <string id="35123" soundid="132407">However, I&apos;m afraid I don&apos;t have time to speak with you right now. I have to prepare my report for Judge Fang... by which I mean to watch over this honor gift.</string>
  <string id="35124" soundid="92143">Our work is undone, but we were doomed from the beginning.</string>
  <string id="35125" soundid="132408">Yes, a valuable offering for the mighty Judge Fang. Without it, he might turn me away before I can even make my report, condemning me to the horrors of Tien&apos;s Landing forever!</string>
  <string id="35143" soundid="132409">But with this gift, he is certain to appreciate the depth of my admiration and respect. So much so, that he might give me a new posting right here in the Imperial City!</string>
  <string id="35144" soundid="132410">Understandably, with so much riding on this gift, I am loathe to leave it in the care of these Imperial soldiers appointed to watch over me during my visit.</string>
  <string id="35145" soundid="92144">Chai Ka: Death and renewal. It is the only acceptable outcome.</string>

  <string id="35175">I&apos;d rather stick a flaming sword in my eye.</string>
  <string id="35176">How dare you talk like that to me, peasant!</string>
  <string id="35177">I don&apos;t know any eligible women.</string>
  <string id="35179">What are you doing in Tien&apos;s Landing?</string>
  <string id="35180">I don&apos;t talk with peasants!</string>
  <string id="35181">This town isn&apos;t crowded; it&apos;s practically deserted!</string>
  <string id="35182">Goodbye.</string>
  <string id="35184">I know a woman who is looking for a husband.</string>
  <string id="35185">Uh... sure.</string>
  <string id="35187">I don&apos;t know. We&apos;d have to ask her.</string>
  <string id="35188">Forget it. She&apos;s all wrong for you.</string>
  <string id="35189">I could help you, if the price is right.</string>
  <string id="35191">I&apos;m too busy for this nonsense.</string>
  <string id="35192">I should be going now.</string>
  <string id="35195" soundid="126706">Can&apos;t say I&apos;m surprised; I&apos;m not the kind of wife most men are looking for. If you want to give up that&apos;s fine. I won&apos;t hold it against you. </string>
  <string id="35196" soundid="126707">But if you happen to find any eligible bachelors, bring them by so I can meet them. Remember: Find me a husband and I&apos;ll make it worth your while.</string>
  <string id="35197">I don&apos;t think I can help you.</string>
  <string id="35200">Yes</string>
  <string id="35201">No</string>
  <string id="35203" soundid="126714">You are well informed about our little town, stranger. It&apos;s true I&apos;ve thought about marriage. Sometimes I&apos;ve even thought a good woman could help me run my business better.</string>
  <string id="35204" soundid="126715">Why do you bring this up? Do you know of a suitable young woman who would be willing to marry a simple craftsman like myself?</string>
  <string id="35205" soundid="126716">Ai Ling? The gang leader? She&apos;s beautiful, to be sure... but I&apos;ve heard her beauty is only surpassed by her savage brutality! Why would I want to marry her?</string>
  <string id="35206" soundid="126717">[Success] She is? Well, I suppose the rumors about her criminal activities are greatly exaggerated. And she is an attractive woman. </string>

  <string id="35208">Martial Style
This style can complete a Harmonic Combo. 

Many in the Jade Empire have heard of Legendary Strike, but few have actually seen it in action. Fewer still have mastered this martial style, but those who have are to be feared; their blows rain down too fast to block, and their kicks can quickly put an opponent out for good.</string>
  <string id="35209">Support Style
Does direct damage in Chi Strike mode
This style&apos;s Power Attack can initiate a Harmonic Combo.

This esoteric style has a sinister reputation, but many more peaceful masters prefer it for its ability to render an opponent helpless without killing him. More unscrupulous masters take advantage of this style&apos;s paralyzing blows to weaken foes for the killing blow. It is designed around its magical palm strikes, which can stop a man in his tracks with a single hit.</string>
  <string id="35239" soundid="117947">It could be worse, I guess. At least we don&apos;t have to worry about the pirates anymore, thanks to you.</string>
  <string id="35378" soundid="42217">Make no trouble here in Tien&apos;s Landing. We&apos;ve had enough.</string>
  <string id="35379" soundid="42218">Every day I hear the sound of the cocks crowing, the peasants singing... and the minister wailing.</string>
  <string id="35380" soundid="42219">The Minister isn&apos;t a bad sort, if you can learn to ignore the sobbing.</string>
  <string id="35382" soundid="42221">I work for the Ministry of Harmony. So leave me alone.</string>

  <string id="35392">Are there students available to spar with?</string>
  <string id="35393">I will spar with a single student.</string>
  <string id="35395">I need some practice against multiple opponents.</string>
  <string id="35396">Two will be enough for this bout.</string>
  <string id="35398">Three will be about right.</string>
  <string id="35400">Four. I will see how I manage against all four.</string>
  <string id="35401" soundid="72485">You look like you could handle yourself in a pinch. Maybe you should join up! Look for a fellow named Qui the Promoter if you want to fight. </string>

  <string id="35504">Goodbye.</string>
  <string id="35514">Gao&apos;s Mercenary</string>
  <string id="35539">Seamstress Lan</string>
  <string id="35605" soundid="42485">I hate to put words in other people&apos;s mouths, but it&apos;s obvious that Gao does not favor you. Master Li has been a mediator of sorts, but Gao responds poorly to authority.</string>
  <string id="35607" soundid="42487">I respect your skill but, as I said, I don&apos;t know any of the students very well. Most everyone seems to respect you.</string>
  <string id="35608" soundid="42488">He is one man and guides his students well. My last school had two masters who feuded all the time. It made learning very difficult.</string>
  <string id="35611" soundid="42491">You must be making up stories. Is this a joke you play on new students? I&apos;m from the Imperial City. I know what happened to the Emperor&apos;s brothers.</string>
  <string id="35612" soundid="42492">The Emperor lost both of his brothers, Sun Li the Glorious Strategist and Sun Kin the Hand of Heaven, when he cured the land of drought. It was a great sacrifice to make.</string>
  <string id="35613" soundid="42493">I still think you are making fun of me. Nothing I heard in the Imperial City about the Emperor&apos;s brothers would suggest that it&apos;s true.</string>
  <string id="35614" soundid="42494">It&apos;s funny, but I still want to look over my shoulder. I have to remember that we are a long way from the ears of the Lotus Assassins.</string>
  <string id="35615" soundid="42495">There&apos;s already enough darkness without making up stories about shadows, in my opinion. Try Lin; she seems very interested in the ghosts.</string>
  <string id="35617" soundid="42497">I honestly didn&apos;t pay much attention during history lessons at my previous school. You could always ask in the town. Old Ming loves talking about the past.</string>
  <string id="35620" soundid="42500">I&apos;m honored that you should ask. What do you want to know?</string>
  <string id="35621" soundid="42501">The school I attended in the Imperial City was becoming mired in politics, so my mother sent me out to the country instead. &quot;Politics is dangerous,&quot; she always said.</string>
  <string id="35623" soundid="42503">Oh, I don&apos;t know. It just seems like the city is changing. Strange people. Strange machines. These are interesting times. I think she just wanted to know that I&apos;d be safe.</string>
  <string id="35624" soundid="42504">That won&apos;t be for a long time, but I&apos;ll probably return to the Imperial City. Perhaps I&apos;ll join the Imperial Guard. It&apos;s hard to think that far ahead.</string>
  <string id="35626" soundid="142029"></string>
  <string id="35627" soundid="42507">Again? I didn&apos;t think my life was that interesting.</string>
  <string id="35628" soundid="142030"></string>
  <string id="35629" soundid="142031"></string>
  <string id="35630" soundid="42510">Yes. Goodbye.</string>
  <string id="35631" soundid="42511">Goodbye. I hope you find Dawn Star.</string>
  <string id="35632" soundid="42512">I don&apos;t waste Master Li&apos;s time. I just feel very new to the school. If time is so valuable here, then I won&apos;t waste any more of yours.</string>
  <string id="35633" soundid="42513">I will just have to work twice as hard to catch up to your level of skill. Even then it will take a long time to be your match. How long have you studied with Master Li?</string>
  <string id="35635" soundid="42515">Even a kind statement would be harsh put so bluntly. I don&apos;t need to suffer this. Goodbye.</string>
  <string id="35636" soundid="42516">I will learn what I can to the best of my ability. If you have nothing constructive to add to that, I see no reason to speak with you.</string>
  <string id="35637" soundid="142032"></string>
  <string id="35638" soundid="142033"></string>
  <string id="35639" soundid="142034"></string>
  <string id="35640" soundid="142035"></string>
  <string id="35648" soundid="142076">I hear one of your ilk has either gone missing or run off. That&apos;s never good news, since there&apos;s nothing more exciting than this town for miles.</string>
  <string id="35649" soundid="42529">I&apos;m not sure I know anything that will help.</string>
  <string id="35650" soundid="42530">With the exception of Gao, everyone is here. Come to think of it, he gathered his things awfully quickly after he was expelled.</string>
  <string id="35652" soundid="42532">Again, all I can think is that Gao left awfully quickly. Beyond that, everyone else is accounted for, except Dawn Star.</string>
  <string id="35655" soundid="42535">By foot there is only one path, and it leads down to the swamps. I have never gone that far.</string>
  <string id="35656" soundid="42536">I&apos;ll answer what I can.</string>
  <string id="35657" soundid="42537">I don&apos;t think so. Perhaps she is at her garden? I do not know her well, but I see her there often. Ask Gao, if he is in a mood to speak. I saw him heading that way.</string>
  <string id="35659">Dirge - Temple Courtyard</string>
  <string id="35660" soundid="42540">I&apos;m sorry, but I haven&apos;t seen her since you last asked.</string>
  <string id="35662" soundid="42542">I don&apos;t know anyone else who displays the skill you do. Perhaps Gao, but he lacks discipline. That is why he still wears the robes of a junior student, despite his ability.</string>
  <string id="35663" soundid="42543">Dawn Star would be next, with few able to match her delicate moves. Beyond that, the only other person I know well is Smiling Mountain, the sparring master.</string>
  <string id="35664" soundid="83680">You learned in the cave how single gems are viewed as trinkets and used by self-professed healers and would-be sorcerers, but you can unlock their full potential.</string>
  <string id="35666" soundid="42546">I know she is sensitive to things the rest of us can&apos;t see. Sometimes I feel sorry for her. It obviously makes her feel &quot;different,&quot; and that&apos;s not right.</string>
  <string id="35667" soundid="42547">I think she was given a gift. Like responsibility, it may not always be pleasant, but it&apos;s something she should be proud of. It shouldn&apos;t isolate her.</string>
  <string id="35668">No style selected</string>
  <string id="35670" soundid="42550">As I said, I sometimes feel sorry for her. She&apos;s such a caring person that she shouldn&apos;t have to feel different from others.</string>
  <string id="35671" soundid="42551">I&apos;ve heard about and seen your skill, but I haven&apos;t been here long enough to know much more. Most of the students seem to appreciate your abilities.</string>
  <string id="35672" soundid="142077">Unless she can run like a wolf, you&apos;d better hope she&apos;s hiding. There&apos;s not much close to town but the swamp and endless fields.</string>
  <string id="35673" soundid="142078">Since my wife died, gossip stopped moving around this town as fast as it once did, but I&apos;ve still managed to hear that you&apos;re going into the cavern beneath the school.</string>
  <string id="35675">Gao&apos;s Mercenary</string>
  <string id="35676">Master Li told me he was the Emperor&apos;s brother.</string>
  <string id="35677">Tell me about the Emperor&apos;s brothers.</string>
  <string id="35678">What do people from the capital think of the Empire?</string>
  <string id="35679">Do you know anything about rumors of ghosts?</string>
  <string id="35681">What can you tell me about the history of the Empire?</string>
  <string id="35684">You&apos;re fairly new here. Tell me some more about yourself.</string>
  <string id="35685">What brought you to this school?</string>
  <string id="35688">What will you do when you are done training here?</string>
  <string id="35690" soundid="142079">Listen well, girl. That cave&apos;s no place for delicacy. Be sure you&apos;re at your best before you face your master&apos;s test in there.</string>
  <string id="35691">Take care, I&apos;ll talk to you later.</string>
  <string id="35692" soundid="142080">Mark me, boy. All the rumors about that cave say it&apos;s a place unfit for life. Be at your best before trying your master&apos;s test.</string>
  <string id="35693" soundid="142081">There were students under other masters who never came back from that hole in the ground.</string>
  <string id="35694">Forgive me. I spoke out of turn. You did not deserve that.</string>
  <string id="35695">I don&apos;t wish to argue, but I am correct.</string>
  <string id="35696">It will be easier if you just accept that you will never be my match.</string>
  <string id="35697" soundid="142082">Showed those cursed bandits a thing or two, didn&apos;t you? Ha! Brought a smile to this old face.</string>
  <string id="35698" soundid="142083">Eh? What now?</string>
  <string id="35699" soundid="142084">Merchant Fen Do should have some, but don&apos;t let him talk you into clippings of bearded tongue grass. That won&apos;t do at all.</string>
  <string id="35701" soundid="142085">Red silk grass will actually bind the wound and make it so she can get back to her practices. That&apos;s why you want it.</string>
  <string id="35702">I want to ask about Dawn Star&apos;s disappearance.</string>
  <string id="35703">Are any other students missing?</string>
  <string id="35706" soundid="105421">I hear you won your last match. Everyone&apos;s been talking about it.</string>
  <string id="35707">How many paths out of the village are there?</string>
  <string id="35708">Let&apos;s go back to my other questions.</string>
  <string id="35709">Have you seen Dawn Star?</string>
  <string id="35711" soundid="105422">Sorry to hear your last match wasn&apos;t that successful. Better luck next time.</string>
  <string id="35712">How well do you know the others at this school?</string>
  <string id="35716">What do you think of Dawn Star?</string>
  <string id="35718">Why do you say that?</string>
  <string id="35719" soundid="145407">I am not interested in money! This... this girl. Her life energy is so vibrant, yet so frail. She is too young to have such a cruel fate.</string>
  <string id="35720" soundid="145408">You! I... I must thank you for what you have done for my daughter, she... she has recovered... in a way.</string>
  <string id="35721">Have you heard anything special about me?</string>
  <string id="35723">Who doesn&apos;t?</string>
  <string id="35725">Since you&apos;re new, I&apos;m interested to hear your thoughts on Master Li.</string>

  <string id="35852" soundid="114701">It is coming on fifteen years now. As I said, I learned the location of the amulet after the monk died in old Tien&apos;s. It has been difficult, serving and waiting in silence.</string>
  <string id="35853" soundid="114702">My assignment is to give you information to help you acquire the amulet. I will gladly answer whatever questions I can.</string>

  <string id="35927" soundid="42991">Hello, young one. My name is Kwan, but everyone calls me Old Mother Kwan. I&apos;d like you to call me that too, okay?</string>
  <string id="35928" soundid="42992">Welcome to my teahouse--oh, that&apos;s not right. No, not anymore. Sorry about the confusion, dearie. What I meant to say was, &quot;Welcome to Master Dutong&apos;s teahouse.&quot;</string>
  <string id="35930" soundid="42994">Hello again, my child. It&apos;s always nice to see you young folk visiting Old Mother Kwan&apos;s teahouse. Oh... I mean, Master Dutong&apos;s teahouse.</string>
  <string id="35931" soundid="42995">Sorry about that, dearie. Sometimes my old mind forgets that the teahouse isn&apos;t mine anymore.</string>
  <string id="35932" soundid="42996">Yes, yes. I owned the teahouse for many, many years. At least, I thought I did. But then Master Dutong came to town with that Imperial Writ. Oh my, wasn&apos;t that a shock!</string>
  <string id="35933" soundid="42997">Turns out his family owns this land. They have for hundreds of years. The land is his, along with everything on it. So now he owns my teahouse, too.</string>
  <string id="35934" soundid="42998">He was nice enough to let me stay on here as a helper. I steep the tea, Yanwan takes the orders, and Master Dutong... well, he mostly just drinks his wine.</string>
  <string id="35935" soundid="42999">Oh, I steep the tea and help clean the tables when Yanwan gets too busy. Pretty much what I used to do back when I owned the place.</string>
  <string id="35939" soundid="43003">No one knew! This was just an empty patch of rock for hundreds of years. Who would have thought the Empire had deeded it to anyone? But Master Dutong came along with his writ.</string>
  <string id="35941" soundid="43005">Now why would I do such a thing? I can&apos;t even imagine anyone being so horrible they&apos;d forge an Imperial Writ. No, I&apos;m sure the land belongs to Master Dutong.</string>
  <string id="35943" soundid="43007">That is very nice of you, my child, but what could you do? I would love to have my teahouse back, but it belongs to Master Dutong now. You can&apos;t argue with an Imperial Writ.</string>
  <string id="35946" soundid="142325">Eh, who are you? An acolyte not even in robes, yet? Go sweep up after the golems. You don&apos;t have the authority to order anything from me.</string>
  <string id="35948">Tomb</string>
  <string id="35949" soundid="43013">Be sure to have some tea before you go! I have a special blend that combines... oh, I forgot; Master Dutong spilled wine all over it. I&apos;m sorry, never mind.</string>
  <string id="35955" soundid="143107">M-master? Are you taking us to the Lotus Assassins?</string>
  <string id="35956" soundid="113908">I trust you and your ability, but we didn&apos;t talk much and... well, it doesn&apos;t matter now. Keep your focus where you need it. I will say no more.</string>
  <string id="35957" soundid="43021">You&apos;ve given me back the only thing I ever cared about... and you&apos;ve done a service for this town, too. I&apos;m going to turn this place back into a respectable, quality teahouse!</string>
  <string id="35958" soundid="43022">I don&apos;t have much; the only reward I can offer is my humble thanks. That, and a promise that you will always be welcome here at Old Mother Kwan&apos;s.</string>
  <string id="35962" soundid="43026">A... a forgery? Are you certain?</string>
  <string id="35966" soundid="113909">I&apos;m not sure what I want to say. I&apos;m sorry we didn&apos;t come to know each other better. It has been so long since we last spoke alone.</string>
  <string id="35967" soundid="113910">I just want... to wish you well and leave it at that. You need to focus on getting the evidence against Death&apos;s Hand so we can rescue Master Li.</string>
  <string id="35969" soundid="43033">That&apos;s sweet of you. But there&apos;s nothing I could tell you, short of how to steep a nice tea. Don&apos;t waste your time gabbing with Old Mother Kwan.</string>
  <string id="35972">What do you do here?</string>
  <string id="35976">You didn&apos;t know he owned the land when you built the place?</string>
  <string id="35978">Did you check the writ to make sure it was real?</string>
  <string id="35979" soundid="115771">That was lucky. I&apos;ll be ready for you next time.</string>
  <string id="35980">I&apos;m going to speak to Dutong about this.</string>
  <string id="35982" soundid="107520">I may be drunk, but that doesn&apos;t mean I *am* a drunk! Because I&apos;m not. Well, just a little bit. But I&apos;m brave too! I&apos;m going to go close the Great Dam and save the town.</string>
  <string id="35985" soundid="143108">What? Thank you... thank you so much. I knew someone would stop them, someone kind and honest.</string>
  <string id="35987" soundid="140298">Be careful, fool! One distraction and I could have been crushed!</string>
  <string id="35989">I should go now.</string>
  <string id="35996">It was nothing. I was glad to help.</string>
  <string id="35998">Just remember that you owe me.</string>
  <string id="36000">Dutong&apos;s writ was a forgery.</string>
  <string id="36001">Dutong confessed. The teahouse is yours again.</string>
  <string id="36008">You used to own this teahouse?</string>
  <string id="36090" soundid="43224">If you want tea, have a seat. The serving girl will be by directly... if I don&apos;t fire her first, the useless wench! I should have replaced her the day I took over this teahouse!</string>
  <string id="36091" soundid="43225">I am Three Sheets Dutong, proud owner of this quaint little teahouse. I recently acquired it from Old Mother Kwan, the elderly lady steeping tea over there in the corner.</string>
  <string id="36092" soundid="43226">Oh, certainly. The Imperial Writ is four hundred years old, and I just carry it around with me all the time and show it to complete strangers. Please!</string>
  <string id="36093" soundid="43227">The writ is locked safely away, as I told Mother Kwan. I&apos;m not about to bring it out on your request! Now, if you will just leave me to my drinking...</string>
  <string id="36094" soundid="43228">No, not the writ. Let&apos;s not talk about that. It&apos;s my shecret shame. Just the thought of that writ brings tearsh to my eyes! It tearsh at my poor, miserable soul!</string>
  <string id="36095" soundid="43229">Oh, I&apos;m a deshpicable pershon! A bad, bad man. The writ... it&apos;sh a fake! A forgery. I made it all up! </string>
  <string id="36098" soundid="43232">What a truly horrible thing to say to me! Especially when I&apos;m sober! The very notion that I, Three Sheets Dutong, could do such a thing is... well, it is unthinkable!</string>
  <string id="36103" soundid="115774">Not bad, but not good enough. Keep practicing, and maybe you will get good enough to give me a real challenge.</string>
  <string id="36105" soundid="91849">It must be something in the way you carry yourself. Everywhere we go people ask you to do dangerous things. Remind me not go anywhere with you.</string>
  <string id="36111" soundid="43245"></string>
  <string id="36112" soundid="43246">Gak! Acchhkkugth! I hate that restorative potion! Ugh! That stuff tastes like vomit baked in a glaze of goat hair and garnished with a sprinkling of horse dung.</string>
  <string id="36113" soundid="43247">And now I have the strangest memory... as if I... oh no. Did I... did I say anything to you, stranger? Anything about, oh, I don&apos;t know... an Imperial Writ?</string>
  <string id="36114" soundid="43248">What? No! I never said any such thing!</string>
  <string id="36115" soundid="43249">Ah, I see what you&apos;re after! Oh yes, Three Sheets Dutong was not born yesterday--or the day before that! Indeed, we are speaking the language of commerce.</string>
  <string id="36116" soundid="43250">I will give you a great deal of silver to keep this little secret from getting out. Lots of silver for both of you, if you keep quiet about this. </string>
  <string id="36117" soundid="43251">Here you go. Yes, yes, take it. And now I consider this matter done with. Now, please go away. I have a pounding headache.</string>
  <string id="36142" soundid="43276">I don&apos;t think we have anything to say to each other. If people see us speaking together they might get suspicious about our... business. </string>
  <string id="36145" soundid="43279">Why do you persist in troubling me? All I want is to be left alone with a steady stream of wine flowing my way. Is that too much to ask in my own teahouse?</string>
  <string id="36148">You own this teahouse?</string>
  <string id="36149">Can I see the writ granting you ownership of this place?</string>
  <string id="36153">Yes. You told me it was a fake.</string>
  <string id="36156">You disgust me, Dutong. We won&apos;t sell Mother Kwan out like this!</string>
  <string id="36157">Give us the silver, Dutong, and we won&apos;t say anything.</string>
  <string id="36164">Nope, not a thing.</string>
  <string id="36176">[Intuition] Maybe you&apos;ll feel better if you tell me about it.</string>
  <string id="36179">I think you conned Old Mother Kwan.</string>

  <string id="36189">Goodbye.</string>
  <string id="36190" soundid="114828">I suppose they do. Especially if what we learned from Jia is true.</string>
  <string id="36191" soundid="114829">I don&apos;t wish to delay collecting on the Princess&apos;... generous offer, but please speak with me before you go to the Necropolis. This troubles me.</string>
  <string id="36192" soundid="114830">I suppose it is wise to secure the recommendation of both, but please speak to me before you enter the fortress. This troubles me.</string>
  <string id="36194" soundid="43385">The Emperor is a wise and powerful man. How else could he have solved the drought so many years ago? I wasn&apos;t born then, but I&apos;ve heard the stories.</string>
  <string id="36195" soundid="43386">It&apos;s true that he hasn&apos;t been seen much recently, but I don&apos;t think it&apos;s anything to worry about. It&apos;s not like the Empire is falling apart in his absence.</string>
  <string id="36196" soundid="43387">Maybe he&apos;s just taking a rest from all the hard work he&apos;s done. Nobody deserves a rest more than the Emperor.</string>
  <string id="36197" soundid="43388">I think they are just rumors. I haven&apos;t seen any ghosts at all, angry or otherwise. If the ghosts are angry about something, why aren&apos;t they here right now?</string>
  <string id="36198" soundid="43389">Come to think of it, I don&apos;t know any one person who&apos;s even *seen* a ghost.</string>
  <string id="36199" soundid="43390">I prefer to spend my time and energy on things that are real. Designing a new prototype flying machine, now, that&apos;s important!</string>
  <string id="36200" soundid="43391">Sure. What would you like to know?</string>
  <string id="36201" soundid="43392">All right, then, goodbye.</string>
  <string id="36203" soundid="43394">I apologize. The masters always remind me not to get ahead of myself. What is it you would like to know?</string>
  <string id="36204" soundid="43395">Sure thing! I&apos;ve got some terrific stuff.</string>
  <string id="36207" soundid="43398">Hello again. I was just finishing up some calculations for my new prototype, but I have a few minutes if you needed something.</string>
  <string id="36208" soundid="43399">Good to see you. I was hoping we might meet again. I want to talk to someone about flyers.</string>
  <string id="36211" soundid="43402">If I had known you were fighting in the arena, I would have placed all my money on you! Then I wouldn&apos;t have to beg for funding for my prototype flyer!</string>
  <string id="36212" soundid="43403">Oh well. I suppose I should be grateful that I got to meet the arena champion. What can I do for you today?</string>
  <string id="36213" soundid="43404">Hey, someone said you&apos;re dealing with the Assassins now. I&apos;d be careful if I were you. They can be a nasty group.</string>
  <string id="36214" soundid="43405">They don&apos;t bother us much, but I still wouldn&apos;t want to work with them.</string>
  <string id="36215" soundid="43406">There&apos;s something strange going on at the Lotus Assassin fortress. I saw smoke rising earlier.</string>
  <string id="36216" soundid="43407">I wouldn&apos;t want to be the person responsible for that, but just between you and me, I know a lot of people are glad to see it happen.</string>
  <string id="36219" soundid="43410">That Outlander had some very interesting inventions, but I&apos;m still glad to see that he&apos;s stopped insulting our people.</string>
  <string id="36220" soundid="43411">You&apos;ve made quite a few friends by getting rid of him... including me. Is there anything I can help you with?</string>
  <string id="36225">Could I ask you a few questions?</string>
  <string id="36228">Tell me about the Imperial City.</string>
  <string id="36230">Just tell me about the important places.</string>
  <string id="36234">Tell me about the city services.</string>
  <string id="36235">Tell me more about the tavern.</string>
  <string id="36237">Spirit Font</string>

  <string id="36243">What can you tell me about Death&apos;s Hand?</string>
  <string id="36248">Have you heard any interesting rumors lately?</string>
  <string id="36254">What else can you tell me about the Emperor?</string>
  <string id="36257">So, you don&apos;t believe the ghosts are angry?</string>
  <string id="36260">May we go back to my first questions?</string>
  <string id="36261">I must be going. Good fortune to you.</string>
  <string id="36263">Slow down. I need to ask you something.</string>
  <string id="36265">Focus Shrine</string>
  <string id="36274" soundid="135477">Want and desire have nothing to do with it. A greater power commands me. You are the one I was summoned for, so I must obey.</string>
  <string id="36275" soundid="116169">Dutong was smart to run off like that. If we ever catch him, he&apos;ll pay for what he did to Mother Kwan!</string>
  <string id="36276" soundid="116170">Dutong claims he&apos;s going to turn this teahouse into a tavern. Can&apos;t see the difference myself.</string>
  <string id="36277" soundid="116171">If it wasn&apos;t for the pirates, I&apos;d have left long ago. But I don&apos;t want to get caught and sold into slavery!</string>
  <string id="36278" soundid="116172">Now that the pirates are gone, I&apos;m thinking of leaving Tien&apos;s Landing. Not sure where I&apos;ll go, though.</string>
  <string id="36280" soundid="116174">They say the ruins are haunted. I wonder if it&apos;s true.</string>
  <string id="36281" soundid="116175">I wonder if Mother Kwan is looking to hire another waitress. I bet she&apos;d pay me a decent wage.</string>
  <string id="36282" soundid="116176">I asked Dutong for a job, but he&apos;s too cheap to pay for more than one waitress.</string>
  <string id="36283" soundid="116177">With the dam closed, the economy here&apos;s picking up. Maybe I can finally get a decent job!</string>
  <string id="36284" soundid="116178">I thought those sailors might have a job for me, but they&apos;ll only pay a girl for one thing, and I&apos;m not interested!</string>
  <string id="36285" soundid="116179">Captain Ing says we can&apos;t come to the teahouse, but I don&apos;t listen to him anymore!</string>
  <string id="36286" soundid="116180">You bringin&apos; me a drink? No? Then go away.</string>
  <string id="36287" soundid="116181">Look at these townsfolk glarin&apos; at us! It ain&apos;t our fault we&apos;re stuck here!</string>
  <string id="36288" soundid="116182">That waitress is a fine looking wench, ain&apos;t she? Doesn&apos;t like sailors much, though.</string>
  <string id="36289" soundid="116183">Stuck in this backwater town, and the place doesn&apos;t even have a decent tavern.</string>
  <string id="36290" soundid="116184">Ing better figure out a way to get our ship back on the water quick... or I&apos;m going to snap!</string>
  <string id="36291" soundid="116185">You&apos;re a pretty looking thing. You&apos;d be prettier if you were bringin&apos; me a drink, though.</string>
  <string id="36292" soundid="116186">You&apos;re no villager. You stuck here, too? Nothing worse than bein&apos; trapped in a dead-end village like this.</string>
  <string id="36311" soundid="44405">Um... well. I have no idea where you&apos;d find them. Honestly, I wouldn&apos;t want to know either. Could we talk about something else?</string>
  <string id="36312" soundid="44406">I... just don&apos;t want to say something I shouldn&apos;t. If you really want to know, go ask someone else. I&apos;m not talking about it anymore.</string>
  <string id="36313">Can you tell me where to find the Inquisitor Recruiter?</string>
  <string id="36314">Let&apos;s go back to my first questions.</string>

  <string id="36524" soundid="43715">People, listen to me: Master Dutong has left. For good. And, thanks to this brave young man here, the teahouse is mine again!</string>

  <string id="36549" soundid="43742">Oh, I&apos;m Scholar Zenyu. I&apos;m one of the newer scholar elites. I was actually born in the poor quarter, but my uncle brought me here when I was only ten.</string>
  <string id="36550" soundid="43743">He knew I would never have a chance at a real life unless I had some proper schooling. I&apos;ve lived here with him ever since.</string>
  <string id="36551" soundid="43744">And of course, there are several shops and merchants with all manner of supplies available. All of that can be found in the Market District.</string>
  <string id="36552" soundid="43745">If you&apos;re interested in fighting, you should speak with Qui the Promoter. You can find him in the Heart of the Empire Tavern most of the time.</string>
  <string id="36553">Who are you? What is it you do here?</string>
  <string id="36558" soundid="43872">I saw what happened with Dutong. I&apos;m surprised a student of Sun Li would cheat an old woman. Not that I much care; you have more important tasks before you.</string>
  <string id="36559" soundid="43873">I suppose you have done a just thing here. But remember: Sun Li needs you, and he is in terrible danger. You have important tasks before you.</string>
  <string id="36588" soundid="43902">Ah, so you are the one who will debate the Outlander. I am the fifth of your five judges.</string>
  <string id="36589" soundid="43903">A great victory in the debate. A win in combat would be a fine way to finish.</string>
  <string id="36590" soundid="43904">Your performance in the debate was not up to the challenge. I hope you fare better in combat.</string>

  <string id="36610">Three Reach Lao</string>
  <string id="36613" soundid="43938">Another distraction, another delay? Very well, but hurry up about it. I&apos;ve a continent to educate and I don&apos;t have all day.</string>
  <string id="36614" soundid="43939"></string>
  <string id="36617" soundid="43942">Well, what shall be my first point of contention? I know! The most basic of concerns for a culture, the currency of its economy.</string>
  <string id="36618" soundid="43943">What manner of society would use the silver coin as the basis of trade? Gold is clearly superior, which you admit by using it for important statuary.</string>
  <string id="36619" soundid="43944">Your understanding of what determines value is flawed. Your rebuttal?</string>
  <string id="36620" soundid="43945"></string>
  <string id="36621" soundid="43946">What! My monocle must be fogged. I can&apos;t see anyone in my favor.</string>
  <string id="36622" soundid="43947">It appears they have reached a consensus against you, Sir Roderick.</string>
  <string id="36623" soundid="43948">Hmm. Clearly these people are incapable of fairly comparing one of their own to an outsider. This is a farce!</string>
  <string id="36624" soundid="43949">Well, it would seem that a majority of your fellows have decided your arguments were more persuasive. I expected no less.</string>
  <string id="36625" soundid="43950">Well, that is all there is to it! You have failed to convince a majority of your own fellows that I am wrong!</string>
  <string id="36626" soundid="43951">We are done, and I have thoroughly trounced you! You and your nearsighted fellows could not defeat a single one of my points!</string>
  <string id="36627" soundid="43952">This will be the final topic. If you don&apos;t have a majority at the end of this round, you will have to admit that I have outdone you.</string>
  <string id="36628" soundid="43953">A simple criticism: your ridiculous clothes. Not a decently puffed pair of trousers to be seen! I ask you, what have you done on the pantaloon front?</string>
  <string id="36629" soundid="43954">And why do you remain so clean when any sane man knows the only way to keep devils of the dark at bay is to be brash and to carry the air of the earth.</string>
  <string id="36630" soundid="43955">Bathing is bad for the humors, as well. Do you people know nothing of maintaining your bile?</string>
  <string id="36631" soundid="43956">Hah! All agree with me! Your downfall is assured! On to the next topic!</string>
  <string id="36632" soundid="43957">Well, a majority on your side, but the debate is not over yet.</string>
  <string id="36633" soundid="43958">I call attention to the arrogance of your Empire. You simply assume that all lands outside your borders are the domain of barbarians and monsters.</string>
  <string id="36634" soundid="43959">How can you truly know they are uncivilized until you&apos;ve proven it by conquest, crushed them beneath your heel?</string>
  <string id="36635" soundid="43960">You sit here thinking while far off lands yearn for direction. Not unlike what I am attempting with you.</string>
  <string id="36636" soundid="43961">Shall I draw attention to your foolish reliance on personal combat? You&apos;ve got strange dragon powder arms, but you waste them on spectacle and flying chariots.</string>
  <string id="36637" soundid="43962">Any decently civilized people would have developed a proper array of personal sidearms by now, like old Mirabelle here.</string>
  <string id="36638" soundid="43963">I challenge your foolish beliefs and the irrational behaviors they produce. Dragons, spirits, and even talk of unresting dead. Bah!</string>
  <string id="36639" soundid="43964">Just look at the collective foolishness that you call a floating palace! The constant superstitious yammering of your peasants even has *me* seeing it!</string>
  <string id="36640" soundid="43965">And how the bloody hell would you get a moat up there? Ridiculous, I say!</string>
  <string id="36641" soundid="43966">I say that you don&apos;t seem to understand the relationship between the ruling class and the peasantry. Your commoners are far too happy to be productive.</string>
  <string id="36642" soundid="43967">A proper spiral of misery shows that they are doing a decent day&apos;s work. Your peasants only suffer because of foolish superstitions about the dead walking around.</string>
  <string id="36643" soundid="43968">Well, you are clearly in the minority, but I can spare no quarter. To the next topic.</string>

  <string id="36740" soundid="44074">Yes, make certain you are ready. The Outlander will be a challenging opponent.</string>
  <string id="36741" soundid="44075">A triumph all around. This Outlander cannot ignore how complete your victory was.</string>
  <string id="36742">What kind of arguments do you favor?</string>
  <string id="36744">What strategy can you offer?</string>
  <string id="36745">I should get ready. Goodbye.</string>
  <string id="36746" soundid="44080">I greet you. My name is Scholar Cai, and I will be the fourth of five judges for the debate. I suggest you don&apos;t mess it up.</string>
  <string id="36747" soundid="118984">Are you implying that I am predisposed to be weak in certain areas? I can&apos;t accept that. Some of my fellows, however, are another story.</string>
  <string id="36748" soundid="44082">Some arguments may win a judge&apos;s favor while turning another away. Vary your topics so that you don&apos;t end up manipulating the same judges over and over.</string>
  <string id="36749" soundid="44083">The Outlander uses flawed logic. Don&apos;t allow him to taint this forum of culture and intellect.</string>
  <string id="36750" soundid="44084">I have no doubt that you will take this Outlander to task in combat. Give him no ground.</string>
  <string id="36751" soundid="44085">I hope you are a better fighter than orator. You certainly could not fare much worse.</string>
  <string id="36752" soundid="44086">The contest is over and you performed flawlessly. I am impressed.</string>
  <string id="36753">What kind of arguments do you favor?</string>
  <string id="36754">What strategy can you offer?</string>
  <string id="36755">I will get ready for the debate. Goodbye.</string>
  <string id="36756" soundid="44090">Greetings to you. I am Scholar Heng, and I will be serving as the second of five judges for the debate. I look forward to honorable discourse.</string>
  <string id="36757" soundid="44091">Ah, you are wise to ask. My tastes are very specific. My mind is only engaged by proper use of fact.</string>
  <string id="36758" soundid="44092">Cite deliberate fact and my vote is always swayed one way or the other. The consideration of real details engages me.</string>
  <string id="36759" soundid="44093">Try to choose your arguments in a sequence that eventually turns everyone in your favor. Don&apos;t worry about losing a vote on a single topic.</string>
  <string id="36760" soundid="44094">Good luck against the Outlander. He is a... tenacious speaker.</string>
  <string id="36761" soundid="44095">A masterful use of intellect. If you beat the Outlander in combat, you will shame him totally.</string>
  <string id="36762" soundid="44096">It is a shame you could not beat the Outlander. I hope you are better at combat than you are at debating.</string>
  <string id="36763" soundid="44097">You have completely routed the Outlander. I commend you on your masterful intellect and martial skills.</string>
  <string id="36764">What kind of arguments do you favor?</string>
  <string id="36766">What strategy can you offer?</string>
  <string id="36767">I should get ready. Goodbye.</string>
  <string id="36768" soundid="44102">Oh, this is exciting. I&apos;ve never been asked to jury a debate before, and now I&apos;m the third of your five judges. My name is Scholar Zou.</string>
  <string id="36769" soundid="118976">I am always impartial, but some of my fellows are easy to goad into decisions, if you know their tastes.</string>
  <string id="36770" soundid="118977">The Minister is particularly fond of confrontational arguments. Respond in a rage and you are sure to engage him.</string>
  <string id="36771" soundid="44105">I&apos;ve argued in this group of scholars many times before. We are so used to each other that we will change opinions just to further the debate.</string>
  <string id="36772" soundid="44106">Don&apos;t worry so much about what you are saying when you respond. Just concentrate on how you say it.</string>
  <string id="36773" soundid="44107">Good luck. This should be an interesting debate.</string>
  <string id="36774" soundid="44108">You won the debate against the Outlander! I hope you teach him a lesson in combat, as well.</string>
  <string id="36775" soundid="44109">The debate did not go your way, but I hope you at least beat the Outlander in combat.</string>
  <string id="36776" soundid="44110">You have secured a great victory for the Empire. The Outlander *has* to respect us now.</string>
  <string id="36777">What kind of arguments do you favor?</string>
  <string id="36778" soundid="118978">He is an insult to our accomplishments as a people. If you fail in the debate, at least take him to task physically.</string>
  <string id="36779">What strategy can you offer?</string>
  <string id="36781">I should get ready. Goodbye.</string>
  <string id="36782" soundid="44116">Remember, you need a majority of judges on your side at the end of six topics.</string>
  <string id="36795" soundid="72487">When you&apos;ve been here as long as I have, you only remember what you *did*, and you keep on doing that. That&apos;s cities for you.</string>

  <string id="36809" soundid="44145">I understand you bested the Outlander in combat. It&apos;s a shame you didn&apos;t beat him in the debate as well.</string>
  <string id="36810" soundid="44146">Is there anything else you want? As the third of the five judges I am eager to begin the debate.</string>
  <string id="36811" soundid="44147">I enjoyed your fight with the Outlander, but I wish you had beaten him in the debate as well.</string>
  <string id="36812" soundid="44148">Is there something else? You shouldn&apos;t waste time. As the fourth of the five judges I will be glad when this debate with the Outlander is over.</string>
  <string id="36813" soundid="44149">A small measure of redemption, I suppose. Perhaps he will acknowledge we are competent in our savagery.</string>
  <string id="36814" soundid="44150">Is there something else you want? As the fifth of the five selected judges, I am eager for the debate to begin.</string>
  <string id="36815" soundid="44151">You redeemed yourself somewhat by scoring a victory in combat, but it is still a shame you could not best the Outlander in the debate.</string>
  <string id="36816" soundid="44152">Greetings, and welcome to the Scholars&apos; Garden. I am Philosopher Jiao, one of the many masters you will see here during your visit.</string>
  <string id="36817" soundid="44153">I see by your accoutrements that you are not from the Imperial City. I hope your visit here is one of fulfillment and success.</string>
  <string id="36818" soundid="44154">Of course. What would you like to know?</string>
  <string id="36819" soundid="44155">I&apos;m afraid I would not be the best person to ask, but there are others to whom I could direct you.</string>
  <string id="36820" soundid="44156">You could ask young Scholar Zenyu. He spends a good deal of time in the city enjoying worldly pursuits, though he does not think his masters know it.</string>
  <string id="36821" soundid="44157">There is also a man named Bai who works near the Imperial Arena. He is renowned for his knowledge of the city.</string>
  <string id="36822" soundid="44158">As you wish. With luck, the winds of heaven will bring us together again one day. Farewell.</string>
  <string id="36823" soundid="44159">A good question. I am sometimes saddened by the fact that I cannot participate more in the life that surrounds me.</string>
  <string id="36824" soundid="44160">However, I forgo these simple pleasures to remain focused on the learning and application of the teachings of Sagacious Tien.</string>
  <string id="36825" soundid="44161">Don&apos;t misunderstand me. I am content with the choices I&apos;ve made. But doubts cannot be completely resolved, and the city is a constant reminder of my decision.</string>
  <string id="36826" soundid="44162">No, perhaps not. Though, many good things can arrive unlooked for. Just the same, if you want anything, please ask.</string>
  <string id="36827" soundid="44163">So, you seek knowledge. Sagacious Tien himself would approve. What is it you would like to know?</string>
  <string id="36828" soundid="44164">As you wish. I will leave you to your wanderings. May the heavens shine favorably on your journey.</string>
  <string id="36829" soundid="44165">Hello again. I hope your time here in the gardens has been a beneficial one so far. Is there anything I can do for you?</string>
  <string id="36830" soundid="44166">Hello there. I hear you decided to test your wits against the Outlander. I am very interested to see the outcome of such a contest.</string>
  <string id="36831" soundid="44167">The Outlander certainly presents a challenge, but I&apos;m confident you will find a solution. What can I do for you today?</string>
  <string id="36832" soundid="44168">Ah, it is too bad that you did not fare better in your encounter with the Outlander. Do not worry, though; often our defeats can teach us more than our victories.</string>
  <string id="36833" soundid="44169">Besides, winning is not always the quickest way to success. Sagacious Tien found many successes only after failing. How can I help you today?</string>
  <string id="36834" soundid="44170">I did not mean to suggest that you intended to lose, merely that the act of losing can itself provide some benefit... if you look for it.</string>
  <string id="36835" soundid="44171">I sense you are not comfortable with this topic. Perhaps we should discuss something else?</string>
  <string id="36836" soundid="44172">Ah, you have done an excellent job defeating the Outlander. Already your name is spreading throughout the Imperial City.</string>
  <string id="36837" soundid="44173">Though I&apos;m sure that is not the reason you decided to challenge the Outlander. Perhaps I can be of some assistance to you, since you have done so much for us.</string>
  <string id="36838" soundid="44174">You have soundly defeated the Outlander in both wits and physical prowess. Only one who closely follows the ways of Sagacious Tien could be so strong.</string>
  <string id="36839" soundid="44175">Ah, it is good to see you. Some of the philosophers doubted that you would prevail in the arena after your initial loss to the Outlander.</string>
  <string id="36840" soundid="44176">I knew differently. People such as you learn from their mistakes and turn their failures into future successes. Congratulations.</string>
  <string id="36841" soundid="44177">Ah, you have made some interesting friends of late. Normally I would not offer such advice, but you should be wary....</string>
  <string id="36842" soundid="44178">&quot;A tiger&apos;s bite is dangerous to his friends and his foes.&quot;  The Assassins do not adhere to the ways of Sagacious Tien, of that you can be certain.</string>
  <string id="36843" soundid="44179">Then I suppose you will not need anything further. I hope you will not have to discover the tiger&apos;s bite for yourself.</string>
  <string id="36844" soundid="44180">There are several people looking for a person who matches your description. I would not hesitate to leave if I were you.</string>
  <string id="36845" soundid="44181">&quot;The true test of any battle comes from within.&quot; Don&apos;t let your pride or arrogance endanger your life. I will help if I can, but you should flee.</string>
  <string id="36846" soundid="44182">A wise decision. Worry not; I will not mention that I have seen you. Go in peace, my young friend.</string>
  <string id="36847" soundid="44183">As Sagacious Tien once said, &quot;More valuable than silk are new friends in a foreign land.&quot; If you need anything, I will be glad to assist you.</string>
  <string id="36848" soundid="44184">As Sagacious Tien once said, &quot;Kind words and respectable attire are seldom a sign of true character. Only deeds reveal the intent of the soul.&quot;</string>
  <string id="36849" soundid="44185">I am glad to help you in any way I can.</string>
  <string id="36850" soundid="44186">I am honored that you would ask me, though I must warn you; the teachings take a lifetime to learn and cannot be taught in a day.</string>
  <string id="36851" soundid="44187">Perhaps I could explain the core principles of Tien&apos;s teachings I could recite the history of Tien, if you like?</string>
  <string id="36852" soundid="44188">The teachings of Sagacious Tien are very simple, but the implications are astoundingly complex. At the heart of the teachings are the concepts of harmony and discord.</string>
  <string id="36854" soundid="44190">Also referred to as the Way of the Open Palm and the Way of the Fist, one cannot exist without the other, but neither can they co-exist in one person.</string>
  <string id="36855" soundid="44191">Harmony *with* the world comes from understanding your place *in* the world. An ant that believes it is a tiger will never achieve harmony.</string>
  <string id="36861" soundid="44197">Sagacious Tien was the first Emperor of the Jade Empire. He was a philosopher and a leader without compare, unifying the warring factions of his time.</string>
  <string id="36862" soundid="44198">His teachings founded this great Empire, though there was very little written about Tien himself.</string>
  <string id="36863" soundid="44199">We do know that he brought peace to the people of the Empire, and, since that time, his teachings have guided hundreds of generations of followers.</string>
  <string id="36864" soundid="44200">Of course. Questions lead to answers, answers to knowledge, knowledge to enlightenment, and enlightenment to peace.</string>
  <string id="36865" soundid="44201">The teachings of Sagacious Tien are based on these precepts. I would be honored to assist you if I am able.</string>
  <string id="36866" soundid="44202">The Scholars&apos; Garden is the seat of learning in the Jade Empire. The philosophers and scholars who live here dedicate their lives to the pursuit of wisdom.</string>
  <string id="36867" soundid="44203">The scholars are dedicated to unlocking the secrets of the physical world. Many still follow the teachings of Sagacious Tien, though some take their studies too far.</string>
  <string id="36868" soundid="44204">I am certainly not opposed to their ways of study. Indeed, the scholars have made many wonderful and important discoveries.</string>
  <string id="36869" soundid="44205">We philosophers dedicate our lives to the study and teaching of the ways of Sagacious Tien. We believe in peace and harmony and balance.</string>
  <string id="36870" soundid="44206">Many find it difficult to grasp the significance or usefulness of our studies, but we assist anyone willing to learn the ancient teachings.</string>
  <string id="36873" soundid="154860">Oh, should I put my hands behind my back while we walk? Ha, ha. No, if you won&apos;t see reason, then this ends here and now!</string>
  <string id="36874">I&apos;ve changed my mind. I think I&apos;d rather just turn you in.</string>

  <string id="36897" soundid="154884">When you reach the Imperial City, you will need a helping hand. Someone with influence and cunning.</string>
  <string id="36898" soundid="154885">A friend of mine will meet you. Follow her instructions and you will be on your way toward your goal. Your discoveries will be... intriguing.</string>

  <string id="36931" soundid="44267">What? No, you know all of my arguments. Besides, I&apos;ve already proven that you speak an infinite deal of nothing. You lost. Accept your inferiority.</string>
  <string id="36932" soundid="44268">It is almost as if... it was too easy. How could you have done so poorly? This is the heart of your culture.</string>
  <string id="36933" soundid="44269">Wait, I see it now. This is some sort of backwards insult, as though I was not worth defeating! Outrageous! You know nothing of proper discourse!</string>

This long sword bears the mark of Shining Fortune, the blacksmith of the gods. Shining Fortune&apos;s weapons were so finely crafted that the gods forbade him from creating weapons for anyone but them. When his son was enlisted to subdue the barbarians from the west, Shining Fortune forsook his oaths and forged this marvelous long sword for his son. The gods cursed Shining Fortune for breaking his oath, and he was never again able to produce weapons of any worth. Still, the blade he made for his son never experienced defeat. It is truly Fortune&apos;s Favorite.</string>

Li Yun, the infamous blacksmith, was held against his will for seven years by Minister Han Tao, who had demanded that the blacksmith forge a pair of marvelous axes for him. In the seventh year of his captivity, Li Yun finally agreed to make the weapons, but he poured all of his hatred into the axes as he made them. Li Yun named the axes Death and Agony, and he promised the minister that he would experience both if he ever tried to wield them.

The scrolls of Peng Qi contain the story of a monk who shaped a flawless staff using only swatches of silk. At first, the silk did nothing but polish the rough wood, but after thirty-four years the staff was perfectly smooth, straight, and flawless. After finishing the staff, the monk told his abbot he was going for a walk to test his new staff, and he never returned. An exiled warrior eventually discovered the staff and attached a sharp blade that is every bit as perfect as the staff itself. It has since been adorned with precious metals, but it remains as flawless as ever.</string>

Forged under an auspicious comet, this staff was originally a gift for the Water Spirit of the Silkworm River. A young prince named Seng Lo sought to win the heart of the Water Spirit and had the staff created as a gift. He then convinced the Great Eastern Serpent to fly him to the heavens, where he dipped the staff in the golden comet. The light of the comet dimmed, but the staff became more powerful than any before it.

  <string id="38726">Return to the Flyer</string>
  <string id="38727" soundid="137102">Ah yes, training. For some time now I have offered, for a small fee, to run students through a short regimen that will help them enhance their abilities.</string>
  <string id="38732" soundid="137103">I heard about Dawn Star. Perhaps I can help in some small way; Fen Do received some essence gems and passed a few along to me. They may be of use to you.</string>
  <string id="38733" soundid="137104">You are improving every day. I have observed your technique, and you may not realize it, but you *are* more resilient. Let me show you.</string>
  <string id="38734" soundid="137105">Now, is there anything else you wish at the moment?</string>
  <string id="38742" soundid="72489">You need to go where people are fresh. The fighters pouring in from the arena are from all over, and new students arrive at the Black Leopard School all the time.</string>
  <string id="38743" soundid="72490">Or go see what nonsense heaven has dropped into the scholars&apos; heads in their garden. Those are the places where someone like you will find things to do.</string>
  <string id="38744" soundid="72491">Shops we have. Mechanic Hin Goo does a smooth trade in flyer parts, for instance. There&apos;s Doctor An in the arena and other merchants in the streets.</string>
  <string id="38806">Return to the flyer to discuss infiltrating the Lotus Assassin fortress.</string>
  <string id="38807">Princess Sun Lian/Silk Fox will take you to the palace where Master Li is secured, but only after she has information to prove to her father that Death&apos;s Hand is a traitor to the Empire.</string>

  <string id="38913" soundid="46552">Nothing great has ever come without conflict. Peace and harmony are simple ideals for simple people.</string>
  <string id="38914" soundid="46553">If you want true peace, you must conquer the world at your door. But you must understand it first.</string>
  <string id="38915" soundid="46554">One can decipher the workings of the physical world if one takes the time to examine them.</string>
  <string id="38916" soundid="46555">Studying the world is the only way to understand it. Looking inward on yourself only shelters you from the realities of the world.</string>
  <string id="38917" soundid="46556">The gods do not control everything as some would believe. Nature is powerful in itself, and we can control nature.</string>
  <string id="38918" soundid="46557">The teachings of the philosophers is based on ancient texts. We must look ahead, not behind, for understanding.</string>
  <string id="38919" soundid="46558">To find true fulfillment, one must understand the workings of the world around him.</string>
  <string id="38920" soundid="46559">The world holds many mysteries, but they are there to be discovered by anyone who will take the time to seek them.</string>
  <string id="38921" soundid="46560">Hmm... yes? Come closer, I cannot see who you are. Is that you again, Zenji? Ayee, no it is not, I can tell by your breath. Please, come no closer!</string>
  <string id="38922" soundid="46561">What is it you want with old Shendao then, hmm? I want to get back to my meditations before I pass away from old age.</string>
  <string id="38923" soundid="46562">Ha! All day long I&apos;m besieged with questions. Master, what is the seventh dictate? Master, how do we achieve inner peace? Master, when is dinner?</string>
  <string id="38924" soundid="46563">It&apos;s a wonder that I get any peace at all.  Well, go on, but be quick about it.</string>
  <string id="38925" soundid="46564">If you don&apos;t already know, I doubt I can explain it to you. The ways of the philosophers cannot be described in such a short time.</string>
  <string id="38926" soundid="46565">I am the eldest philosopher here, and so I seem to have no end of people chasing me about and asking inane questions.</string>
  <string id="38927" soundid="46566">Oh... ho ho. I see your senses have truly left you. You don&apos;t have to be a master to know that questions like that can get you into trouble.</string>
  <string id="38928" soundid="46567">If you want to know something about that... fiend, I suggest you ask him yourself. Though I doubt you&apos;d have the temerity to do so.</string>
  <string id="38929" soundid="46568">Which Emperor? There have been many, you know? You must make your questions more clear if you want a clear answer, hmm.</string>
  <string id="38930" soundid="46569">I will assume that you meant Emperor Sun Hai. I can tell you that I know a great deal, most of which you have no need to know.</string>
  <string id="38931" soundid="46570">Suffice it to say that the Emperor is a great man who has lived through many hard trials. He is far more powerful than any Emperor I have known in all my days.</string>
  <string id="38932" soundid="46571">The real question is where he gets that power. But I go too far; it is unwise to speak about such things, especially to people like you.</string>
  <string id="38933" soundid="46572">That is not a question! How can this Li call himself your Master when your skills are so obviously undeveloped?</string>
  <string id="38934" soundid="46573">You have not even told me what this Li is a master of! Is he a master of knitting or martial arts? How can I give you an answer based on such flimsy questions?</string>
  <string id="38935" soundid="46574">Perhaps your master was so frustrated by your ineptitude that he decided to quit and leave his home in Two Rivers. I certainly wouldn&apos;t blame him.</string>
  <string id="38936" soundid="46575">Have you no sense at all? I will not even try to explain to you why such a question is foolish and reckless. Now move along, or ask me something else.</string>
  <string id="38937" soundid="46576">Good, good. You go now. May heaven guide you... someplace else.</string>
  <string id="38938" soundid="46577">Calm, you say? You wouldn&apos;t know calm if it shouted its arrival in your ear. All the world rushes madly about and then expects you to be calm. Ha!</string>
  <string id="38939" soundid="46578">[Failure] Ha! There are some who would travel for many miles just to hear some of my &quot;grumblings.&quot; You have no appreciation for wisdom, so I will not waste any on you.</string>
  <string id="38940" soundid="46579">Ah, it is you again. Your breath betrays you. I have no time to waste on you. Leave me to my meditations.</string>
  <string id="38941" soundid="46580">Do not come any closer! I would not want to confuse you with my &quot;grumblings.&quot; Ha! Off you go.</string>
  <string id="38942" soundid="46581">Now you&apos;ve done it, haven&apos;t you? You can&apos;t fool me; I know you had something to do with the happenings at the Lotus Assassin fortress.</string>
  <string id="38943" soundid="46582">Well, I won&apos;t say I&apos;m sad to see it happen to them, and I&apos;m certainly not surprised that you had something to do with it.</string>
  <string id="38944" soundid="46583">You&apos;ve got yourself in with an interesting lot, haven&apos;t you? What mischief are you and your Lotus Assassin friends up to now?</string>
  <string id="38945" soundid="46584">No, don&apos;t tell me, I don&apos;t want to know. Just don&apos;t expect me to tell you any secrets.</string>
  <string id="38946" soundid="46585">So, the Outlander has met his match. I might have guessed you would be the one to deal with that noisy fool.</string>
  <string id="38947" soundid="46586">Though I won&apos;t truly have any peace until everyone decides to let me be.</string>
  <string id="38948" soundid="46587">Ha! Did you have fun bashing around all those witless barbarians in the arena? Bah... Champion! Do you think your achievements will impress me?</string>
  <string id="38949" soundid="46588">Well, get on with it then! No doubt you&apos;re here to pester me about some trivial matter that only a *master* can help you with.</string>
  <string id="38950" soundid="46589">Once again you come and disturb my rest, and in return for this *kindness* I expect you want me to help you, hmm?</string>

  <string id="38969">Can you tell me where to find the Inquisitor Recruiter?</string>
  <string id="38970">I should be going. Goodbye.</string>
  <string id="38971">Please be calm.  I just want to ask a few questions.</string>
  <string id="38973">I&apos;ll leave you to your studies.</string>
  <string id="38974" soundid="172554">The ones that hurt... the spirits have such sad stories. The people don&apos;t know, though. All they understand is that they feel bad, but don&apos;t know why.</string>
  <string id="39029">Pirate</string>
  <string id="39091" soundid="46730">Welcome, friend. The lecture won&apos;t be starting for a little while, though your enthusiasm is appreciated.</string>
  <string id="39092" soundid="46731">I wouldn&apos;t worry about seating. Those interfering philosophers have made sure that very few people will be attending the lecture.</string>
  <string id="39093" soundid="46732">Certainly, we can&apos;t learn without asking questions. How can I help you today?</string>
  <string id="39094" soundid="46733">Ah, don&apos;t let the name fool you. There are fewer scholars here than you might think. We are far outnumbered by those obstinate philosophers.</string>
  <string id="39095" soundid="46734">The philosophers believe that the gods dictate everything, from the rising of the sun to the changing seasons. If the summer ends too soon or too late, the gods must be angry.</string>
  <string id="39096" soundid="46735">Of course, anyone who cares to look can see that the birds control the weather. I have noted, with some accuracy, that the birds predict the seasons.</string>
  <string id="39097" soundid="46736">I have a theory that the massive movements of birds in the autumn and spring actually cause the prevailing winds to change direction.</string>
  <string id="39098" soundid="46737">When birds fly south just before autumn, they cause the winds to change. We get cold air from the north until the spring, when the birds reverse the winds again.</string>
  <string id="39099" soundid="46738">It&apos;s really quite simple, but just try telling that to one of the philosophers.</string>
  <string id="39100" soundid="46739">Don&apos;t get me wrong; I like most of the philosophers. But their strict adherence to aging traditions makes them very difficult to deal with. </string>
  <string id="39101" soundid="46740">They&apos;re always preaching about peace and harmony. Really! We kill and subdue the creatures of this world in order that we can survive! Where&apos;s the peace in that?</string>
  <string id="39102" soundid="46741">Can a man survive long without eating meat? What about the grains we use to make our bread, or the hides we use for any number of things? We consume constantly.</string>
  <string id="39103" soundid="46742">Peace and harmony are wonderful ideals, but in nature only the strong survive, and they don&apos;t do it by being peaceful!</string>
  <string id="39104" soundid="46743">I&apos;m glad you asked. Today, I will speak on my theories of cloud formation. That was my first major discovery, though it hasn&apos;t been widely accepted... yet.</string>
  <string id="39105" soundid="46744">The basic principles are really quite simple: I deduced, after lengthy study, that clouds are formed by the moisture escaping from our bodies. </string>
  <string id="39106" soundid="46745">When the weather is cool, you can clearly see small clouds escaping from people&apos;s mouths. Similar clouds form on the skin of people working strenuously in the cold.</string>
  <string id="39107" soundid="46746">These clouds of breath rise up and collect near the tallest peaks, where it is almost always cloudy. This was one of my finest discoveries.</string>
  <string id="39108" soundid="46747">Oh, so soon? All right, then. I hope to see you again soon. Perhaps I could explain to you my theories on the formation of ice crystals.</string>
  <string id="39109" soundid="46748">Oh, that&apos;s too bad. Perhaps after I&apos;ve answered some of your questions you will change your mind. What would you like to know?</string>
  <string id="39110" soundid="46749">I&apos;m sorry. I can&apos;t speak with you now. It would be unwise for me associate with someone with your... affiliations.</string>
  <string id="39111" soundid="46750">Go, leave me be. They&apos;re looking for you, or someone like you. I don&apos;t want them to think I had something to do with this. Go!</string>
  <string id="39112" soundid="46751">So, you&apos;re the one who will take on the Outlander. From what I&apos;ve seen, the Outlander will fare poorly in a debate against one as skillful as you.</string>
  <string id="39113" soundid="46752">Of course, between your debate and the philosophers&apos; complaints, I suppose my lecture will be completely ignored. [sigh] Such is the life of a scholar.</string>
  <string id="39114" soundid="46753">Ah, I am sorry to hear about your... defeat. I was as surprised as anyone that the Outlander could defeat you in a debate.</string>
  <string id="39115" soundid="46754">If I had not been so busy with my lecture, I would have liked to debate with him myself. Though I&apos;m sure the philosophers would have had something to say about that.</string>
  <string id="39116" soundid="46755">Ah, perhaps you are right. I&apos;m sorry. I did not mean to be so presumptuous. Let me make amends by offering you my assistance. Is there anything you require?</string>
  <string id="39117" soundid="46756">Of course, what exactly would you like to know?</string>
  <string id="39118" soundid="46757">As you wish. Again, I am sorry if I offended you. Please come back if you need anything.</string>
  <string id="39119" soundid="46758">Excellent work defeating the Outlander! You&apos;ll make quite a name for yourself if you keep that sort of thing up!</string>
  <string id="39120" soundid="46759">I&apos;m sure the philosophers are overjoyed with your success. Peace and harmony were of no use against the Outlander. Sometimes you simply need to outwit your opponent.</string>
  <string id="39121" soundid="46760">You are gaining many friends in this city, my friend. Defeating the Outlander in a debate *and* in combat is quite an accomplishment.</string>
  <string id="39122" soundid="46761">No doubt the philosophers are somewhat less impressed with your feats of physical prowess. I, for one, think your skills are quite remarkable!</string>
  <string id="39123" soundid="46762">My apologies. I assure you, I spoke with the utmost sincerity. What would you like to know?</string>
  <string id="39124" soundid="46763">You were very successful against the Outlander in combat. Don&apos;t let the philosophers convince you otherwise just because you lost to him in a debate.</string>
  <string id="39125" soundid="46764">The fact is, you solved the problem! And, it reinforces what I&apos;ve said all along: Peace and harmony are not always the best means to resolve conflict.</string>
  <string id="39126" soundid="46765">Ah, good to see you again, my friend. Have you returned to listen to my lecture, or would you just like some information?</string>
  <string id="39128">I see. Could I ask you some questions?</string>
  <string id="39129">Tell me about the Scholars&apos; Garden.</string>
  <string id="39132">Really? How does that work?</string>
  <string id="39135">Why do you mistrust the philosophers?</string>
  <string id="39139">What is your lecture about?</string>
  <string id="39143">Actually, I think I&apos;ll be going.</string>
  <string id="39144">I&apos;m not here for a lecture. I just want some answers.</string>
  <string id="39147">May I ask you some questions?</string>
  <string id="39148">I doubt you would have fared any better!</string>
  <string id="39149">I need some answers.</string>
  <string id="39150">No, nothing right now.</string>
  <string id="39153">Thank you. May I ask you some questions?</string>
  <string id="39154">Enough with the flattery. I just want some answers.</string>
  <string id="39156">Sorry, I&apos;m just here for some information.</string>
  <string id="39157">I&apos;m not interested in a boring lecture. I need answers.</string>
  <string id="39168" soundid="49070">My barge will get you where you want to go, safe and sound. Even drunk, I can navigate the river ten times better than anyone else in the village.</string>
  <string id="39176" soundid="49071">I&apos;ll be there. I&apos;m a man of my word, despite what you might have heard. I&apos;m not just some useless old drunk. You&apos;ll see.</string>

This style&apos;s Area Attack can initiate a Harmonic Combo that produces a Chi power-up.

Warriors willing to tread a darker path learn that a confused mind is a weakened one. This infamous Support style is a collection of techniques that render the practitioner&apos;s foe disoriented and unable to fight back. A master of Hidden Fist is not above using dirty tricks and forbidden strikes to serve the goal of total domination.

Viper emphasizes speed and unpredictability, alternately lulling the opponent with rhythmic movements and striking with incredible speed.

  <string id="40185" soundid="47977">We can&apos;t have peace! But we can have revenge. Kill Kindly Yushan for me, big person. Kill him for abandoning us in the orphanage! Kill him for leaving our bones here to rot!</string>
  <string id="40186" soundid="47978">The bones! That&apos;s it! The orphan-master must bury our bones! He left us to this, only he can end it. If Kindly Yushan comes here and buries our remains, we can finally rest.</string>
  <string id="40187" soundid="47979">He never tried! He didn&apos;t care about us. Nobody cares about us! I bet he still goes out at night and drinks in the teahouse. It&apos;s like we never existed!</string>
  <string id="40188" soundid="47980">Yushan spent his nights at the teahouse. He would lock the orphanage when he left so we didn&apos;t get out and cause trouble in the town. He had the only key.</string>

  <string id="40244" soundid="134691">The amulet trains you to access what is already present, something Sun Li misunderstood. However, as a focus it still allows him to take my power much faster than his brother did.</string>

  <string id="40253">Tell me about the Ravager.</string>
  <string id="40258">I want to hear your thoughts on the Sung brothers.</string>
  <string id="40261">Do you know of any recruiters for the Lotus Assassins?</string>
  <string id="40265">Lucky Cho mentioned Kai Lan the Serpent and the Guild. What can you tell me about this?</string>
  <string id="40266">How did Kai Lan take control like this?</string>
  <string id="40268">Where did the Serpent come by his magical skills?</string>
  <string id="40271">Why haven&apos;t you done anything about this whole situation?</string>
  <string id="40273">That&apos;s enough about the Guild. I have other questions.</string>
  <string id="40275">Let&apos;s talk about Kai Lan and the Guild again.</string>
  <string id="40276">Black Whirlwind has told me about his time here. What do you know about him?</string>
  <string id="40278">Black Whirlwind says Raging Ox is actually dead. Do you believe that?</string>
  <string id="40279">Whirlwind claims his brother is dead. Have you been lying to me about him?</string>
  <string id="40282">Mad Bling Bling</string>
  <string id="40294">You&apos;re dead now!</string>
  <string id="40303" soundid="48111">Ask me? Why ever would the vaunted Silver Division champion speak to one of his inferiors?</string>
  <string id="40304" soundid="48112">Trying to figure out how to deal with Soldier? Not a chance.</string>
  <string id="40305" soundid="48113">You are going to lose and lose again until you finally stop trying. If you drop out of the arena in shame, so much the better.</string>
  <string id="40306" soundid="48114">I don&apos;t pay attention to the Bronze Division. Who has time for all the hopefuls and their empty dreams?</string>
  <string id="40307" soundid="48115">Haven&apos;t you figured it out yet? I don&apos;t like you. You&apos;re nothing more than a worm, and I don&apos;t talk to worms.</string>
  <string id="40308" soundid="48116">Now go on and leave me alone. We&apos;ve got nothing to talk about.</string>
  <string id="40314" soundid="125774">We learned a few things about you. About how we felt about you.</string>
  <string id="40319" soundid="139464">Welcome, welcome. Did someone from the Black Leopard School send you? No... I suppose you don&apos;t quite look like one of their students.</string>
  <string id="40321">With:</string>
  <string id="40329" soundid="165648">It is your plan, acolyte. I will assume you are asking to make sure your methods do not anger me. Very well, which do you have questions about?</string>
  <string id="40331">I couldn&apos;t make that decision.</string>
  <string id="40337">Are you still concerned about Dawn Star?</string>
  <string id="40338">I want to ask you some questions.</string>
  <string id="40357" soundid="134693">Let the wisdom of the abbot guide you if you need aid. Restore the second fountain and I will speak to you again... if I am able.</string>
  <string id="40370" soundid="48179">Why are you back? Is it because you like it when I hurt you?</string>
  <string id="40371" soundid="48180">Miao! Stop that! Not all big people want to hurt us. What do you want, living one? Have you... have you come to help us?</string>
  <string id="40378" soundid="48187">We have nothing of value, living one. We are... we are only spirits.</string>
  <string id="40383" soundid="145410">She&apos;s changed since the operation. As if she was a completely different person, and this person... frightens me sometimes. I&apos;ve seen her do things my daughter would never do.</string>
  <string id="40384" soundid="145411">But she is still my daughter. Sometimes I see the pain behind her eyes, before those other eyes come to replace them. Then I think that someday those new eyes will turn on me.</string>
  <string id="40385">I&apos;ll cause more havoc than that before I&apos;m finished.</string>
  <string id="40386" soundid="145413">Ah! My dear. I was just... I was just saying....</string>
  <string id="40387" soundid="145414">I... I thank you for what you have done for us and... and we must be going now. I... I apologize... for everything.</string>
  <string id="40412" soundid="145416">Ah! It&apos;s you! I wanted the chance to thank you again for what you have done for my daughter. She can live a full and healthy life now. One a father can be proud of.

  <string id="40685" soundid="149852">Most likely she&apos;s still at our old home. She&apos;d take it as her own with me out of the way. It&apos;s in the Market District near the entrance to the Black Leopard School.</string>

  <string id="40690" soundid="149857">My malice is not for you, mortal, but for her and her alone. She will suffer for the pain she has caused me. Bring her forward.</string>
  <string id="40691" soundid="149858">No! You don&apos;t understand! This was all an accident! It was the fish... the salmon... it was bad. You died because it poisoned you.</string>
  <string id="40692" soundid="149859">The fish? I died from a fish? You expect me to believe such a stupid excuse?</string>
  <string id="40693" soundid="149860">How can you be so certain? How can you believe her, after you know what she&apos;s done to me?</string>
  <string id="40695" soundid="149861">Because he believes me. He has seen me at our home, mourning for you still. Not a day has gone by where I didn&apos;t cry over your death.</string>

  <string id="40717" soundid="149881">I exist only for revenge. Revenge on my wife who, after so much talk of &quot;faithfulness&quot; and &quot;love&quot; decided she would be better off without me. She killed me!</string>

  <string id="40719" soundid="149883">We&apos;d been having fights, my wife and I, and she decided to end it. I sat down to eat, and the next thing I knew, I had choked to death and ended up here.</string>

  <string id="41136" soundid="49108">You clearly do not understand how complex life can be. Why, if I just stopped drinking wine... I&apos;d... I&apos;d... I&apos;d probably have a better chance at finding a wife, I suppose.</string>
  <string id="41137" soundid="49109">Then she&apos;d make me get up before midday. I&apos;d pole the barge and ride the river all day, then I&apos;d come home to a house full of kids. And a wife... probably with a big dinner on the stove....</string>
  <string id="41138" soundid="49110">Yes, it does sound... nice. Even worth giving up the wine for. But it&apos;s not that easy. I... I don&apos;t think I&apos;d be strong enough. I&apos;m just a useless old drunk.</string>
  <string id="41139" soundid="49111">Thank you, my friend! I am going to get sober, find some poor unfortunate woman, and make her my wife! And it&apos;s all thanks to you. I owe you more than I can say. Thank you!</string>
  <string id="41140" soundid="49112">Nonsense! People say that all the time, but they don&apos;t really mean it. I&apos;ve made bad decisions, and now I must live with them. I can&apos;t just suddenly turn my life around.</string>

  <string id="41526" soundid="126552">What respectable man would ever want to marry a girl like me? Even the lummoxes in my gang would only do it because they&apos;re afraid of me.</string>
  <string id="41527" soundid="126553">This town is short on eligible bachelors as it is. I mean, there are a few guys out there I know of... but none of them would be interested in me.</string>
  <string id="41528" soundid="126554">I have a reputation around town, and having my boys beat up Bei didn&apos;t help any. Any half-decent man would probably run if they saw me coming.</string>

  <string id="41530" soundid="126556">But don&apos;t think I&apos;m desperate enough to settle for just anyone. I&apos;ve got my standards. And I&apos;d have to meet him first, of course.</string>
  <string id="41531" soundid="126557">Let&apos;s see... there&apos;s Ru the Boatswain, but he&apos;s nothing but a drunk. My boys have had more than a few run-ins with him over the years. He&apos;s definitely out.</string>
  <string id="41532" soundid="126558">Hmmm... Chumin the Craftsman is single. I don&apos;t know him that well, but he seems like a good man. He has a home in the southwest corner of the town.</string>
  <string id="41533" soundid="126559">And then there&apos;s Yaoru. He used to be a sailor traveling the Empire, but now he&apos;s looking to settle down. He might be a good catch. Spends most of his time in the teahouse.</string>
  <string id="41534" soundid="126560">Not living in town, and Tien&apos;s Landing doesn&apos;t get a lot of visitors. But if you find someone looking for a wife, bring him by so I can check him out.</string>
  <string id="41536">Find and speak to Lord Yun.</string>
  <string id="41537">With the forest closed, you may as well search for answers. Reach the Pilgrim&apos;s Rest and see what this Lord Yun has to say.</string>
  <string id="41539">Investigate the forest&apos;s corruption.</string>
  <string id="41540">Lord Yun has asked that you help him discover what is tainting the forest, and causing it to trap people within. Once you discover the cause of the corruption he will aid you in reaching the Imperial City.</string>
  <string id="41542">Seek the truth behind the Inn.</string>
  <string id="41543">Return to the Pilgrim&apos;s Rest and seek out the true source of corruption in the forest.</string>
  <string id="41545">Escape the Caves</string>
  <string id="41546">Reaching the Imperial City will require escaping these caves. Finding a legible wind map seems unlikely in this filthy place.</string>
  <string id="41548">Head to the Imperial City</string>
  <string id="41549">Kang the Mad is certain this windmap will carry you safely to the Imperial city. Speak with him when you are ready.</string>
  <string id="41551" soundid="126561">Yeah, right. The pickings in Tien&apos;s Landing are mighty slim for a girl like me. But if you find someone, just bring him by so I can meet him. And... well... good luck.</string>
  <string id="41552" soundid="126562">Of course not. Why should you? Why should anyone care about me? Just leave me alone... I might as well get used to it. I&apos;m going to be alone forever.</string>
  <string id="41553" soundid="126563">So, how&apos;s the husband hunting going? If you find any good prospects, just bring them on by. You find me a keeper, and I&apos;ll make it worth your while.</string>
  <string id="41554" soundid="126564">Don&apos;t worry, I won&apos;t bother Bei anymore. I just have to accept the fact that I&apos;m never going to find a husband.</string>
  <string id="41556">That&apos;s no excuse for what you did.</string>
  <string id="41557">You could still find a husband.</string>
  <string id="41560">Maybe I can help you find a husband.</string>
  <string id="41562">Tell me about the town&apos;s bachelors.</string>
  <string id="41563" soundid="49625">Suffice it to say that the Serpent makes it worth our while to fight as a group. You would benefit as well, if you could beat us.</string>
  <string id="41564">So handily that you can no longer fight alone, it seems.</string>
  <string id="41568">It sounds like you&apos;re unhappy with the situation.</string>
  <string id="41570">Why not just refuse to fight as a group?</string>
  <string id="41571">What incentives are those?</string>
  <string id="41572">Enough about you. I want to ask about the other fighters.</string>
  <string id="41622" soundid="71343">Eh, suit yourself.</string>
  <string id="41624" soundid="49691"></string>
  <string id="41625" soundid="49692">Always a pleasure to see a fine young lady at the bar. Not many people stopping by recently.</string>
  <string id="41626" soundid="49693">You look like a strong fellow. Probably need a few bowls to put you under a table, which is good. Not many people stopping by recently.</string>
  <string id="41627" soundid="49694">Is it? I hadn&apos;t noticed, but you&apos;re the customer, so it&apos;s all as you say.</string>
  <string id="41628" soundid="49695">Oh, I couldn&apos;t really speak to that. No, I&apos;m not one to pay attention to the comings and goings of the arena.</string>
  <string id="41629" soundid="49696">Now, something to drink, or just here to chat?</string>
  <string id="41630" soundid="49697">I just serve drinks, but you&apos;re welcome to ask whatever you like.</string>
  <string id="41631" soundid="49698">Wait a minute. You&apos;re with the... gentleman aren&apos;t you? Extremely large, somewhat odorous? The Black... something. Yes, he mentioned you.</string>
  <string id="41632" soundid="49699">I&apos;m afraid he&apos;s already running a tab under your name. Runs in here more often than the hourglass turns. I can&apos;t extend credit to you as well.</string>
  <string id="41633" soundid="49700">Exactly. It would wreak havoc on my books if I allowed two people to drink off the same account. The Ministry of Harmony would shut this place down.</string>
  <string id="41634" soundid="49701">No, but he did. I am but a humble barkeep, while he is a humble, gigantic, axe wielding battle-hardened warrior prone to fits of murderous anger. The choice seemed obvious.</string>
  <string id="41635" soundid="49702">Besides, as a member of the arena, you shouldn&apos;t be drinking yourself into a stupor.</string>
  <string id="41636" soundid="49703">I&apos;m certain you understand, and even if not, there is little I can do now. Now, is there something else I can help you with?</string>
  <string id="41637" soundid="49704">If you ever do, I&apos;ll be here.</string>
  <string id="41638" soundid="49705">You&apos;re back? Nothing much has happened since you&apos;ve been gone.</string>
  <string id="41639" soundid="49706">The Lotus Assassins? Can&apos;t help you much there. Don&apos;t know anything about the Lotus Assassins.</string>
  <string id="41640" soundid="71344">Yeah, well the old guy&apos;s a bit of a slacker, but....</string>
  <string id="41641" soundid="49708">No, nothing at all except that they take exceptional interest in people who ask questions about them. An exceptional interest indeed.</string>
  <string id="41642" soundid="49709">Can&apos;t rightly say. I&apos;m sure it was a misunderstanding of some sort. I didn&apos;t really see what happened.</string>
  <string id="41643" soundid="49710">Oh, it&apos;s easy to miss such things. Busy drink orders, dirty bowls... any number of things can come up.</string>
  <string id="41645" soundid="49712">Don&apos;t trouble yourself over such things. Stirring up things that bothered you only summons them back to do so again. Best to move on.</string>
  <string id="41646" soundid="49713">I&apos;m sorry? It was my understanding that I run this establishment.</string>
  <string id="41647" soundid="49714">Not that I can recall. A smart man knows when it&apos;s best not to know. You could learn from that.</string>
  <string id="41648" soundid="49715">I&apos;m sorry, but I&apos;m unaware of anyone in control of anything beyond the questions they choose to ask.</string>
  <string id="41650" soundid="49717">Ultimately, you&apos;re not here to worry about shadowy figures in control of things, are you? You&apos;re here to enjoy yourself, so do so!</string>
  <string id="41651" soundid="49718">Sorry, can&apos;t say I&apos;ve heard of him.</string>
  <string id="41652" soundid="49719">Oh, was he? Well, in that case, extend my best regards his way.</string>
  <string id="41653" soundid="49720">This Serpent fellow must be a dangerous man, if he held that position for any length of time. Certainly not a man I would cross... were I an acquaintance, of course.</string>
  <string id="41654" soundid="49721">Does he? Then I&apos;m sure someone else must know him. Important work, running things. Important work.</string>
  <string id="41656" soundid="108752"></string>
  <string id="41657" soundid="49724">Why talk about it when you can walk about it? Wander the streets, take in the sights. Don&apos;t stay in here if you&apos;re curious.</string>
  <string id="41658" soundid="49725">Not much more than what you&apos;d see by looking around yourself.</string>
  <string id="41659" soundid="49726">This tavern&apos;s the usual setup: You order a drink, you get one, and you either stare at it mournfully or drink it and order another.</string>
  <string id="41660" soundid="49727">You should direct questions about the arena to Qui the Promoter. He&apos;s usually in the back rooms where the fighters mill about.</string>
  <string id="41661" soundid="49728">I don&apos;t follow the arena much.</string>
  <string id="41662" soundid="49729">Oh heavens, no. I have vital things to attend to up here. Vital things that in no way influence the very expensive bets parading around this place.</string>
  <string id="41663" soundid="49730">I&apos;d have to say whoever you&apos;re up against next, son.</string>
  <string id="41664" soundid="49731">Whoever&apos;s facing you next would be the most likely person to watch out for, miss. I can&apos;t imagine staring too far past them would help you much.</string>
  <string id="41665" soundid="116234">Dutong doesn&apos;t pay me anything right now. But next week he&apos;s going to double that!</string>
  <string id="41666" soundid="108754">So, I hear you helped out Baker Bei today. Gave my boys a bit of a lesson, didn&apos;t you?</string>
  <string id="41668" soundid="108756"></string>
  <string id="41669" soundid="108757">Lan? What are you doing here?</string>
  <string id="41671">What? This place is busy right now.</string>
  <string id="41672">No, look around, it&apos;s really busy.</string>
  <string id="41673">How could this tavern be slow with the arena in the same building?</string>
  <string id="41675">May I ask you some questions?</string>
  <string id="41676">What do you have to drink?</string>
  <string id="41678">You&apos;re saying I can&apos;t drink because someone else is drinking for me?</string>
  <string id="41680">I didn&apos;t approve that oaf&apos;s drinking!</string>
  <string id="41682">I need nothing from you right now.</string>
  <string id="41683">Do you know anything about recruiters for the Lotus Assassins?</string>
  <string id="41685">What was happening with that man who was roughed up?</string>
  <string id="41686">It happened right in front of you, how could you not see it?</string>
  <string id="41690">Forget I asked.</string>
  <string id="41691">What can you tell me about the Guild that runs this place?</string>
  <string id="41692">You know nothing about the Guild that&apos;s supposed to be in charge here?</string>
  <string id="41694">I know all about them. I just want your take on their control here.</string>
  <string id="41696" soundid="108758">I figured we better get all the secrets out, Bei. If Lan&apos;s going to marry you, she should know what kind of man you really are.</string>
  <string id="41697" soundid="126584">You are free to do as you wish with it. I think it still functions. There are figurines in the chest next to it that are part of the riddle it presents.</string>
  <string id="41698">Can you tell me about Kai Lan the Serpent?</string>
  <string id="41699">You must have! He was a champion in the arena.</string>
  <string id="41701">Don&apos;t bother trying to protect him. I know he runs things around here.</string>
  <string id="41702" soundid="126585">Just don&apos;t let it interfere with more important tasks. I do not favor such unsophisticated diversions.</string>
  <string id="41703" soundid="141863">You fought well, and the record is yours.</string>
  <string id="41704">Can we talk about the Imperial City?</string>
  <string id="41705">What can you tell me about the arena and this tavern?</string>
  <string id="41708">Any advice for me with regards to the arena?</string>
  <string id="41709">It&apos;s right behind you though! You don&apos;t just look around?</string>
  <string id="41710">All I want is to know who to watch out for.</string>
  <string id="41711" soundid="108762">What? Bei, how could you!</string>
  <string id="41712" soundid="108763">I didn&apos;t! It&apos;s a lie. I haven&apos;t spoken to her in years... not since we were kids!</string>
  <string id="41713" soundid="108764">Don&apos;t pretend like you don&apos;t remember, Bei! It was summer, and we were sitting on a little raft catching fish. I was upset because Lishun had called me ugly. </string>
  <string id="41714" soundid="108765">What? But that... that was years ago. We were kids. We were only six years old! You can&apos;t hold me to that!</string>
  <string id="41715" soundid="141864">I have a feeling it will stay yours for some time. Smiling Mountain says I will be fine, but his eyes told me that I may have injured myself badly.</string>

  <string id="42328" soundid="109296">Hello again. What can I do for you?</string>
  <string id="42330" soundid="109298">You must be the new student. I&apos;m Fifth Brother Shangjin. There&apos;s been quite a stir regarding your entry into the school... most unorthodox.</string>
  <string id="42331" soundid="109299">It would seem Master Radiant is up to his tricks again. Regardless, you&apos;ve defeated Sixth Brother so we can spar. Would you care to try your skills against mine?</string>
  <string id="42332" soundid="109300">Good. Follow me.</string>
  <string id="42335">Imperial Soldier</string>
  <string id="42339" soundid="109307">The Black Leopard School is the most respected school in all the Empire, but we are losing that respect.</string>
  <string id="42348">Yes, I&apos;d like to fight you now.</string>
  <string id="42353" soundid="151737"></string>
  <string id="42354" soundid="151738"></string>
  <string id="42355">Tell me about the Black Leopard School.</string>
  <string id="42358">Where is Second Brother?</string>
  <string id="42359">You weren&apos;t hurt?</string>
  <string id="42360">I need to go. Goodbye.</string>
  <string id="42362" soundid="109330">My blades would be brittle, and even simple iron work would be clunky. Eventually, I had to leave home.</string>
  <string id="42363" soundid="109331">My father is no longer my father. More precisely, I&apos;m no longer a son in his eyes. </string>
  <string id="42364" soundid="109332">I wasn&apos;t sure what to do after being cast from my home, but coming east to the city made sense.</string>
  <string id="42365" soundid="109333">Don&apos;t think for a moment this makes me happy. I fight these memories every day.</string>
  <string id="42366" soundid="109334">Until your instruction, the only training I had was watching the fights here. I came a long way by myself, and I think I can go further still now that I&apos;ve had your help.</string>
  <string id="42367" soundid="109335">I was never properly trained. I&apos;ve learned what I have from watching the fights here. Practicing hard and staying focused.</string>
  <string id="42368" soundid="109336">That&apos;s my story. One day, I&apos;ll make it here, and my father will have to be proud of me. This is my chance to be someone great, and I&apos;m sticking to it!</string>
  <string id="42369">Why did you have to leave?</string>
  <string id="42370">How did you end up here in the arena?</string>
  <string id="42372">Where did you learn to fight?</string>
  <string id="42373">You&apos;re far too happy for any of this to be true.</string>
  <string id="42377" soundid="109345"></string>
  <string id="42378" soundid="109346">Was that Sagacious Zu up ahead? I knew he was a traitor. Why else would he be sneaking into the fortress?</string>
  <string id="42379" soundid="109347">We will have to be doubly careful. There&apos;s no telling what traps he has laid out for us.</string>
  <string id="42380" soundid="109348">Was that Sagacious Zu ahead? I know he wouldn&apos;t leave us, but what is he doing sneaking in there?</string>
  <string id="42381" soundid="109349">Keep a careful eye out. He may be in need of our help.</string>
  <string id="42382" soundid="109350">It seems our crafty friend is one step ahead of us. To clear the way or set the alarm, I wonder.</string>
  <string id="42383" soundid="109351">Be on your guard. We cannot know his intent if he is unsure of it himself.</string>
  <string id="42384" soundid="109352">That was Zu up there, wasn&apos;t it? Hmm... maybe we will get lucky and he&apos;ll set the whole place on us.</string>
  <string id="42385" soundid="109353">Might not be the best one to be *in,* but it will be grand to see.</string>
  <string id="42386" soundid="109354">Was that Sagacious Zu? What&apos;s he doing here?</string>
  <string id="42387" soundid="109355">Chai Ka: His presence here does not damn him, but be on your guard, for many things are uncertain.</string>
  <string id="42388" soundid="109356">Ya Zhen: The coincidence of his being here does not mean he works against us, but I would kill him, just to be sure.</string>
  <string id="42389" soundid="109357">Sagacious Zu is ahead of us? What fool willingly descends into a ghoulish place like this? Only the most disturbed of madmen, certainly.</string>
  <string id="42390" soundid="109358">Er, outside of ourselves, of course. We remain perfectly sane, despite doing exactly the same.</string>
  <string id="42400" soundid="109370">Fair enough.</string>
  <string id="42401" soundid="109371">You, of all people, should know about it.</string>
  <string id="42402">Let&apos;s go back to my other questions.</string>
  <string id="42404" soundid="109387">Wait a minute. I want to see the pirates get what&apos;s coming to them, but there&apos;s no point in doing this the hard way.</string>
  <string id="42405" soundid="109388">No, wait! My pirate days are long behind me, I swear. I&apos;ll even help you get rid of those guards out on the dock.</string>
  <string id="42406" soundid="109389">Those drunks on the pier were supposed to unload the ship, but they&apos;re too lazy to finish the job. They left a cannon suspended above the dock, supported by this single rope.</string>
  <string id="42407" soundid="109390">One quick pull and that cannon comes crashing down, taking out the dock and anyone on it. But my old bones can&apos;t pull hard enough to loosen the knots in the rope.</string>
  <string id="42408" soundid="136207">They&apos;re... they&apos;re dead! I don&apos;t have to sweep the dock no more! You saved me!</string>
  <string id="42409" soundid="136208">But there&apos;s more pirates inside. Lots more. They&apos;ll catch you, and you&apos;ll be a slave like the rest of us. Or they&apos;ll kill you.</string>
  <string id="42410">A washed up old man used to be a scourge of the seas?</string>
  <string id="42411">How are you going to get even?</string>
  <string id="42415">Guard</string>
  <string id="42432">Run along, old man. I&apos;ll take care of them.</string>
  <string id="42437" soundid="125529">We will talk again. This distraction will not last forever. My father must answer to these claims.</string>
  <string id="42438" soundid="51115">This area is off limits! Intruders will be executed!</string>
  <string id="42439" soundid="51116">I am a soldier of the Imperial Army, sent by Death&apos;s Hand to destroy anyone foolish enough to enter this place.</string>
  <string id="42440" soundid="51117">Unfortunately, this includes you! Kill the peasant!</string>
  <string id="42441" soundid="51118">Do not whine to me, peasant! We have orders from Death&apos;s Hand himself. All intruders die!</string>
  <string id="42442" soundid="51119">Impudence! We have orders from Death&apos;s Hand himself, peasant. All intruders die!</string>
  <string id="42443">Who are you?</string>
  <string id="42445" soundid="125530">Then we can deal with more pleasurable topics.</string>
  <string id="42446">I didn&apos;t have a choice about landing here.</string>
  <string id="42447">I go where I like.</string>
  <string id="42448" soundid="125531">I want answers, and there is only one place left to get them.</string>
  <string id="42449" soundid="125532">You delay us just to chat with your dashing rogue? Be quick about it.</string>
  <string id="42450" soundid="125533">About me? I am Princess Sun Lian the Heavenly Lily. What more are you worthy of knowing?</string>
  <string id="42451" soundid="51124">You! Peasant! Are you the one who has been killing all of these soldiers? Feel honored, for now you die by the hand of their leader.</string>
  <string id="42453">I better kill you to keep you quiet.</string>
  <string id="42455" soundid="125534">I do not remember ever being allowed to just be a child. My mother died when I was born, shortly before the end of the Long Drought and the fall of my uncles.</string>
  <string id="42456" soundid="125535">I was in the care of tutors too afraid to punish me, and too ingratiating to teach me anything useful. I quickly found ways to sneak away from the palace.</string>
  <string id="42457" soundid="125536">They dared not report my excursions for fear they would be punished. They would scurry around all day trying in vain to find me.</string>
  <string id="42458" soundid="125537">Yes, it was. I... didn&apos;t fully understand the risk and made some mistakes, but in the end, what I have become is a result of that.</string>
  <string id="42459" soundid="125538">In the city, I met the people: the peasants, the homeless, the thieves. It was a much different world from what you see from the palace.</string>
  <string id="42460" soundid="125539">I met the people: the peasants, the homeless, the thieves. Such a different world from what you see from the palace walls.</string>
  <string id="42461" soundid="125540">They never realized who I was. I&apos;m sure they would have been terrified of the army storming in to rescue me. Most just wanted to be left alone.</string>
  <string id="42462" soundid="125541">That life was exciting, but also useful. Even Lotus Assassins overlook the beggar on the street, but she still has eyes and ears.</string>
  <string id="42463" soundid="125542">Ah, the shadow behind my public self. How else can a curious princess learn what really happens in her domain?</string>
  <string id="42464" soundid="125543">I don&apos;t have time to interpret the veiled statements of advisors, so I became a thief, an assassin, whatever I needed to be.</string>
  <string id="42465" soundid="125544">People will not speak to the princess; bad news kills the messenger first. Silk Fox knows how to persuade. That is how I learned about the activities of Death&apos;s Hand.</string>
  <string id="42466" soundid="125545">There are many excuses for a vain princess to retreat from sight for days, even weeks at a time. My father encourages such getaways.</string>
  <string id="42467" soundid="125546">And if courtiers ever discovered that I was not where I said I would be, who would dare question the Heavenly Lily?</string>
  <string id="42468" soundid="125547">I may eschew the formality of it, but being the daughter of the Emperor still has its privileges.</string>
  <string id="42469" soundid="125548">There is a freedom in it. I have the resources to go anywhere and the secrecy to do anything. If I wished it, I could be quite carefree.</string>
  <string id="42470" soundid="125549">But that is not what I have found in practice. Instead, I see how my father&apos;s reign has twisted, and I know I must do something.</string>
  <string id="42471" soundid="55736">One day I&apos;ll reach your level of skill, but not unless I keep practicing with Smiling Mountain</string>
  <string id="42473" soundid="136209">This whole island is crawling with pirates. They&apos;ll kill you... but they won&apos;t catch me again! I know where to hide!</string>
  <string id="42475" soundid="51137">Fascinating! How very interesting to meet you!</string>
  <string id="42476">Seek Out the Executioner Recruiter</string>
  <string id="42477" soundid="51139">I release these healing energies through the very precise insertion of needles into the skin. It truly is an art.</string>
  <string id="42478" soundid="51140">Acupuncture is also a most ancient science, studied as long as the Empire has stood. Those studies benefit the warriors in this place most directly.</string>
  <string id="42479" soundid="51141">How can you fight in the dark? We learn these things through study and discipline.</string>
  <string id="42480" soundid="51142">The nerves of the hand are incredibly sensitive. The eyes can be fooled by something as insubstantial as light.</string>
  <string id="42483" soundid="51145">My needles, used properly, can enhance your strength, restore your inner vitality, and unlock energies you barely knew your body held.</string>
  <string id="42484" soundid="51146">The only thing I have found I am unable to affect with my needles is your inner magic. It seems even acupuncture has its limits.</string>
  <string id="42485" soundid="51147">Of course! Only through the broadening of our conversations can we broaden our minds.</string>
  <string id="42486" soundid="51148">I&apos;m afraid I can&apos;t help you. I know all the fighters, but I am not at liberty to discuss them.</string>
  <string id="42487" soundid="109437">You would delay us for a chat with your precious country girl? Pat her head and get back soon.</string>
  <string id="42489" soundid="51151">I have things to prepare. I understand Hapless Han will be fighting soon, and the poor lad requires considerable attention after his bouts.</string>
  <string id="42490" soundid="51152">What I do know is that several of the techniques pioneered by what we call the &quot;new schools&quot; would have astonishing effects on one with your energy.</string>
  <string id="42491" soundid="51153">Miraculous?</string>
  <string id="42492" soundid="51154">There are no miracles in acupuncture! It is... a science! Tested and refined for thousands of years. Bah. Miracles are for the heavens.</string>
  <string id="42493" soundid="125550">I do not like to speak about that. I try to avoid the court as much as possible.</string>
  <string id="42494" soundid="125551">It is filled with sycophants pandering to the fancies of my father, with little or no concern to their own dignity.</string>
  <string id="42495" soundid="125552">It is... distasteful.</string>
  <string id="42496" soundid="125553">I can handle myself better than any of the fancy courtiers who attempt to match me. I know that someday the court will be mine to rule.</string>
  <string id="42497" soundid="125554">The imperial court performs a necessary function in a very inefficient way.</string>
  <string id="42498" soundid="125555">When I succeed my father, there will be quite a cleaning-out. But with Death&apos;s Hand manipulating him, that day seems less and less likely.</string>
  <string id="42499" soundid="125556">It would be very improper for someone of my standing to say anything... unless you make me a little more comfortable.</string>
  <string id="42500" soundid="125557">I have already shared something of myself. Can you tell me something about you? Is there anyone that you care for?</string>
  <string id="42501" soundid="125558">That... that I can relate to. I know what it&apos;s like to be alone. I have suitors in love with my station, not me. They speak to me for their own gain, nothing else.</string>
  <string id="42502" soundid="125559">But I can&apos;t allow myself to take the high road in this manner. Am I the Heavenly Lily or the Silk Fox? I am lying to everyone in some way. </string>
  <string id="42503" soundid="125560">I should not be ungrateful. Everything in my life is dedicated solely to making me happy, but I am at odds with so much.</string>
  <string id="42504" soundid="125561">I am always behind a mask, not just when I am Silk Fox. I am not allowed to show an interest in politics, defending the Empire... or even spontaneous affection.</string>
  <string id="42505" soundid="125562">You were amusing at first, but now I am drawn further than I meant to be. What do you suppose I should do about that?</string>
  <string id="42506" soundid="125563">Can you see the dilemma you represent? Not only is our deepening friendship prohibited by station, but by... so much more.</string>
  <string id="42507" soundid="125564">I am not certain I want you to.</string>
  <string id="42508" soundid="125565">If the freedom you suggest is there, I have never felt it. I have hidden within this costume so I would not have to conform to what others want.</string>
  <string id="42509" soundid="125566">It feels more like a retreat than a victory. I can show strength, certainly, but only by hiding my true nature.</string>
  <string id="42510" soundid="125567">I have tried to make a place for myself. It was difficult, but I have succeeded, despite Death&apos;s Hand or my father, or what people think.</string>
  <string id="42511" soundid="125568">The Jade Empire has had strong female leaders before. Most met with... unfortunate ends. At critical junctures, they were abandoned.</string>
  <string id="42512" soundid="125569">Whatever I decide... about the Empire or... about you, can I count on you to be here?</string>
  <string id="42513" soundid="125570">You asked me about my first love. It was the Empire and its people. There might be room for another... given time and effort.</string>
  <string id="42514" soundid="125571">I don&apos;t think I will shatter any grand conventions of the Empire by courting outside the list of pockmarked nephews of statesmen.</string>
  <string id="42515" soundid="125572">You and I will have much to discuss after we have restored my father. I am looking forward to it.</string>
  <string id="42516" soundid="125573">How would the court react? You have the skill to be charmingly discrete, but a few people could use a shock, now and then.</string>
  <string id="42517" soundid="125574">If I remain useful? You goad me this far, only to reveal I am little more than a tool? I don&apos;t understand you, and I can&apos;t spend all my energy trying.</string>
  <string id="42518" soundid="51155">Allow me a formal introduction. I am Doctor An, acupuncturist.</string>
  <string id="42521" soundid="51158">I know you well enough. Hapless Han stumbled in here for yet another treatment after you defeated him.</string>
  <string id="42522" soundid="51159">In your rise to become our most honored champion, I have seen much of what you do, albeit after the fact.</string>
  <string id="42523">Lucky Cho</string>
  <string id="42524" soundid="51161">You are one of the arena&apos;s contestants, are you not? I hear talk that you are one of the most promising new contenders.</string>
  <string id="42525" soundid="125575">But you are another matter. </string>
  <string id="42526" soundid="125576">When I look at you, I see someone I could know better than anyone. Someone who could understand... what I need.</string>
  <string id="42527" soundid="125577">It frightens me how much you intrigue me.</string>
  <string id="42528" soundid="125578">[Success] Hmm, no doubt you would. You treat me like the foolish boys I have tossed aside in the past. I think... I rather like that.</string>
  <string id="42529" soundid="51162">I do not recognize your voice, but within it I can hear the energy of one trained for combat.</string>
  <string id="42530" soundid="51163">But I should not prattle on at you. What do you need from me?</string>
  <string id="42531" soundid="125579">[Failure] You are brazen. If you had the guile to disguise this affair, we might have a future, but I just... don&apos;t know.</string>
  <string id="42532" soundid="125580">I don&apos;t know that my eyes are ready to be opened as wide as you want. Perhaps... perhaps when the well being of the Empire is less of a distraction.</string>
  <string id="42533" soundid="125581">In another time... things might be different.</string>
  <string id="42534" soundid="51164">While I cannot see you, your appearances are hard to ignore. Welcome again.</string>
  <string id="42535" soundid="125582">As princess, I cannot pick and choose what rules of the Empire I follow... not if I am trying to restore the glory it once had.</string>
  <string id="42536" soundid="125583">You tease with a friendship that has no future. I have many suitors, in both of my guises, but you draw me in like no other. </string>
  <string id="42537" soundid="125584">How have you done this? Why have you done this? </string>
  <string id="42539" soundid="125585">Is that what this is? For me it almost became more. I... I&apos;m glad you made your intentions clear, but I don&apos;t wish to play this game anymore.</string>
  <string id="42542" soundid="125586">You taunt with feelings I cannot have and dare not want. And it is my fault for encouraging you. You are unlike any woman I have ever met. </string>
  <string id="42543" soundid="125587">It&apos;s funny; I turned many men into fools with charms similar to those you now direct at me. I truly did not understand the power we hold. Why do we not rule?</string>
  <string id="42544" soundid="125588">Now you sound like a revolutionary. I no longer know if you speak of personal desires or the fate of the Empire. Perhaps you see them as the same.</string>
  <string id="42545" soundid="125589"></string>
  <string id="42546" soundid="125590">[Success] You asked me to tell you of my first love. Until this moment it was the Empire. Until this moment....</string>
  <string id="42547" soundid="125591">Now I see how I have been a slave to tradition, how I have worked to save an Empire that does not satisfy me.</string>
  <string id="42548" soundid="125592">When we take control back from Death&apos;s Hand, there will be changes. After all, things got this way because of foolish weaknesses.</string>
  <string id="42549" soundid="125593">Silk Fox will be getting quite a bit of attention from now on. If I decide that some of it will be yours, you will know.</string>
  <string id="42550" soundid="125594">You may regret what you have done here. Do you know what it will take to satisfy me, now that what I want is so important?</string>
  <string id="42551" soundid="51168">Hapless Han stumbled in here for yet another treatment after you defeated him.</string>
  <string id="42554" soundid="51171">Are you here for a treatment, or simple socializing?</string>
  <string id="42555" soundid="51172">Of course! Have a look.</string>
  <string id="42556" soundid="51173">The Lotus Assassins? I know nothing.</string>
  <string id="42557" soundid="51174">I have heard rumors that they recruit from the higher levels of the arena, but I discount such notions.</string>
  <string id="42558" soundid="51175">Acupuncture is the process of healing the body through the release of its own energies. There are other applications, such as an understanding of the pressure points of the body as well.</string>
  <string id="42559">The recruiter for the Lotus Assassin Executioners in usually found in the tavern within the Imperial Arena, which is located at the north end of the Market District.</string>
  <string id="42560">What&apos;s strange about my energy?</string>
  <string id="42561">How can you perform acupuncture when you&apos;re blind?</string>
  <string id="42563">How do these treatments work?</string>
  <string id="42564" soundid="109438">Hurry up. I need answers, and there&apos;s only one place left to get them.</string>
  <string id="42565">What benefits could I receive from your skills?</string>
  <string id="42567">Can we talk about something else?</string>
  <string id="42568">The Watcher</string>
  <string id="42569">Can you answer some questions about the arena?</string>
  <string id="42570" soundid="109439">Good. My father has much to answer for. I know he will explain everything. And if Death&apos;s Hand is there... I&apos;ll have some words for him, as well.</string>
  <string id="42571" soundid="109440">Kang! Those flags that I gave you, the ones with the royal seals? Mount them on your pile of scrap and let&apos;s go! I don&apos;t want to waste any more time!</string>
  <string id="42572">I should let you be.</string>
  <string id="42573">The new schools of what?</string>
  <string id="42574">You must be the local seller of miraculous cures.</string>
  <string id="42578" soundid="125595">We will have much to *discuss* once we dispose of Death&apos;s Hand. I look forward to a... stimulating conversation.</string>
  <string id="42579" soundid="125596">Your attention... until a short time ago I would not have thought that was an option. You intrigue me.</string>
  <string id="42580" soundid="125597">Hmm, I am sure you would. Again you treat me like the foolish boys I have tossed aside in the past. I think... I like that.</string>
  <string id="42581" soundid="125598">I say that I will decide what is meant to be and what is not. If you are lucky, perhaps I will even tell *you.*</string>
  <string id="42582" soundid="125599">Yes it is. This must never be allowed to happen again. You have opened my eyes. I will not shut them again.</string>
  <string id="42583" soundid="125600"></string>

  <string id="43210">Actually, let&apos;s to go back to my previous options.</string>
  <string id="43212">I want to fight someone using the style Master Li used against the bandits.</string>
  <string id="43219" soundid="55737">Gao does not have the patience to properly learn what Master Li is trying to teach us.</string>
  <string id="43250" soundid="65823">How fascinating. I was given to understand that the Horselords&apos; lands were mostly plains, but there can be trees among the plains I suppose.</string>
  <string id="43251" soundid="60445">You&apos;d think more visitors would come to see Master Li, but I don&apos;t think he likes to draw attention.</string>
  <string id="43252" soundid="60446">I heard some talk about restless dead, but it seems like foolishness to me.</string>
  <string id="43253" soundid="60447">We haven&apos;t seen many visitors lately. People are traveling less because of silly ghost stories.</string>
  <string id="43254" soundid="60448">The village is as quiet as ever. Why does Master Li seem so concerned all the time?</string>
  <string id="43255">I think you would do well at court.</string>
  <string id="43257" soundid="60451">I always knew that Gao child would get himself into trouble.</string>
  <string id="43258" soundid="60452">Your little bit of excitement has taken our minds off the troubling stories about ghosts that are going around.</string>
  <string id="43259" soundid="60453">There&apos;s no excuse for Gao&apos;s behavior. Not in a little place like Two Rivers.</string>
  <string id="43281" soundid="107820">I must say, champion, that it was an honor to face you in battle. I hope you fare well. I turn my eyes to the east, where new challenges await me by the ocean.</string>
  <string id="43293" soundid="107822">I had a feeling you might get there. Easier that we worked things out the way we did. You&apos;ve got Iron Soldier&apos;s respect.</string>
  <string id="43294" soundid="107823">No, your skills will just waste away with no challenges. I wonder if it&apos;ll be me, the Sung brothers, or some other upstart who brings you down.</string>
  <string id="43327" soundid="55738">Master Li says that these are troubled times, but he has sheltered us from any disturbances.</string>
  <string id="43328" soundid="55739">Master Li says to always remember the basics. He is wise to provide our skills such a strong foundation.</string>
  <string id="43333" soundid="60454">The more I hear about that Gao, the less I want him around.</string>
  <string id="43334">It doesn&apos;t sound very interesting.</string>
  <string id="43336">After Sun Li&apos;s defeat, Kang the Mad enjoyed actual public appreciation for his devices. It was brief, however, and as the Empire returned to peace, his machines once more became the greatest identifiable threat to the common good. His flyers grew faster and more durable, the driving force often an angry mob hurling ever larger stones. When last seen, Kang was boarding an alarmingly bare-bones device he had dubbed the Celestial Rocket Chair. While it allowed him to evade his latest pursuers, the launch also left a crater that suggested the escape was more permanent than he might have planned. Despite this, on each anniversary of their victory, &lt;FullName&gt; would find a fantastic new machine on &lt;his/her&gt; doorstep, seemingly appearing out of nowhere.</string>
  <string id="43338" soundid="175161">You don&apos;t seriously think you&apos;ll catch me out with that strategy, do you, Vo?</string>

  <string id="43343" soundid="60464">No one can find Gao? Why would they be looking?</string>
  <string id="43344" soundid="60465">I hope your missing students didn&apos;t leave the village. I hear it&apos;s not that safe out there.</string>
  <string id="43345" soundid="60466">I hope Dawn Star is safe. You students should know that it&apos;s not safe to go wandering out by the swamps.</string>
  <string id="43346">There is no one for me.</string>
  <string id="43350" soundid="109441">Yes, ma&apos;am, no argument. Garish flags to stop the turrets. Just no yelling while we fly. The space is small and it echoes loudly.</string>
  <string id="43351">You are Princess Sun Lian, but that does not mean you are any less deserving of being happy.</string>
  <string id="43354">I do not want to cause you discomfort. I will withdraw, if you wish.</string>
  <string id="43356" soundid="109442"></string>
  <string id="43357" soundid="107044">Not me! I&apos;d rather put up with Soldier than your gloom.</string>

  <string id="43527" soundid="60000">Oh no! Poison! That&apos;s terrible! Who would do such a thing?</string>
  <string id="43528" soundid="60001">I&apos;m sure someone will figure it out eventually. Even the Guild can&apos;t overlook something like this!</string>
  <string id="43529" soundid="60002">Enough dwelling on this dark topic. She died in battle, and we will remember her as a warrior.</string>
  <string id="43530" soundid="60003">You? You&apos;re a monster! How could you...?</string>
  <string id="43531" soundid="60004">I can&apos;t believe I called you Master once. No more! I want nothing to do with you.</string>
  <string id="43532" soundid="60005">This place was bad enough without you. We didn&apos;t need another cheat, liar, or murderer among our ranks. Go away! I want nothing to do with you.</string>
  <string id="43533" soundid="60006">I&apos;ve heard rumors that the Serpent will fix fights at the higher levels, too. Watch out for that.</string>
  <string id="43534" soundid="60007">For instance, even with a glass jaw, it&apos;s better to be hit there then on the windpipe. Yep, next time that situation comes up, I&apos;ll remember to keep my chin low.</string>

  <string id="43536" soundid="60009">That was so nice of you though. I&apos;m sure you didn&apos;t have to lose, but to offer hope in an exhibition match like that, that&apos;s so impressive.</string>
  <string id="43537" soundid="60010">It&apos;s funny when you think that our champion never really changed, until you came along. And to think, I was one of the first to face you. It was an honor!</string>

  <string id="43543" soundid="60016">I do remember Raging Ox. He was always full of life, and he had fun in the ring. He was a much better champion than the Ravager.</string>
  <string id="43544" soundid="60017">He&apos;s a powerful magician and incredibly deadly in battle. Retired Imperial Champion, in fact.</string>
  <string id="43545" soundid="60018">It was like they recruited him after seeing what he could do here. Maybe there&apos;s some arrangement that makes the Lotus Assassins overlook this place.</string>

  <string id="43551">Can I ask you a few questions?</string>
  <string id="43554">No, none at all.</string>
  <string id="43555">She was far too weak to face me.</string>
  <string id="43557">She was poisoned before the match.</string>
  <string id="43558">I have no idea.</string>
  <string id="43560">I would. It was quite wonderful to watch her die slowly.</string>
  <string id="43565">Do you have something to hide, Han? Maybe I *should* turn you in.</string>
  <string id="43570" soundid="109445">You will see. This is trickery from Death&apos;s Hand... or someone else.</string>
  <string id="43572">I&apos;d be more concerned if I were you, Soldier. You&apos;re next.</string>
  <string id="43591" soundid="158386">What do you want? *hic* Can&apos;t you see we&apos;re busy drinking here? Gotta wash away our sorrows.</string>
  <string id="43592" soundid="64152">Let one get away? Now that reminds me of my favorite song. &quot;I&apos;m a sailor fine... and I like my wine... on the water blue....&quot; Do you know the rest of the words?</string>
  <string id="43593" soundid="60935">I am a very good merchant! Besides, most of what was taken were simple perishables like grain or fruit. Hardly worth the bother of trying to protect.</string>
  <string id="43594" soundid="60936">The only thing I&apos;m really upset about is a clay figurine. Yesterday, Tong, one of the sailors, took it. There was nothing I could do to stop him.</string>
  <string id="43595" soundid="158387">It&apos;s no fun bein&apos; trapped in this town. We don&apos;t know nobody, we ain&apos;t sheen our families in months, and now we&apos;re shtuck here. *hic* That&apos;d drive anyone to drink.</string>

  <string id="45619" soundid="138327">I&apos;m sure there is, my student.</string>

  <string id="45624" soundid="138332">What if I guarantee your name will live in the heart of each and every citizen in the Jade Empire?  It is a glory beyond mere heroics. You would be eternal.</string>
  <string id="45625" soundid="138333">I do not seek power as my brother did. I will correct the violence inherent in Man. I will make certain there are no more wars, no more droughts.</string>

  <string id="45629" soundid="138337">Your name will forever be lauded. In the end, is that not the only immortality worth having?</string>
  <string id="45633" soundid="138338">Forever. Not a man, woman, or child will go a day without acknowledging your sacrifice. Many have struggled for utopia; you will be the heart of it.</string>

  <string id="45635" soundid="138340">Then let it be done. You give yourself to a far greater glory than you could ever know.</string>

  <string id="45637" soundid="138342">Tell me, what use are heirs to a god? I will set the Empire on a path of never-ending stability and glory. I am beyond this.</string>
  <string id="45638" soundid="138343">That it was Dawn Star only reinforces this truth. I would have recognized her, had I cared to. What use are heirs to a god?</string>
  <string id="45639" soundid="138344">Ah, so even *you* know when to cast aside those who have moved beyond usefulness. Then you understand why you, too, must fall.</string>
  <string id="45640">I&apos;m listening.</string>
  <string id="45643">I will be eternal anyway. The power is mine when you die!</string>
  <string id="45645">I fall, but my name lives on forever? Why would I agree?</string>
  <string id="45647">Forever remembered as a hero by all?</string>
  <string id="45648">Then I agree.</string>
  <string id="45649">No, you will not win. Let&apos;s end this. Master versus student.</string>
  <string id="45650">For the Jade Empire and the name of &lt;FullName&gt;, I agree.</string>
  <string id="45653">She deserves better. I can&apos;t allow this.</string>

  <string id="46218" soundid="165538">I won&apos;t be stopped now that I&apos;m this close, and luckily you&apos;re here. That will make it easier to reach the upper levels where he hides himself away.</string>
  <string id="46219" soundid="165539">As I said, Gao the Greater took something valuable from me, and he deserves to have that favor repaid.</string>

  <string id="46257">The Forest Shadow is destroyed, and her influence over the forest has been removed. Without it, the forest will never recover from its twisted corruption.</string>
  <string id="46258">The Forest Shadow has agreed to temporarily remove her influence over the forest in the hopes that this will lure whatever corruption dwells within the inn into revealing itself.</string>
  <string id="46259">Investigating the temple proved to be fruitless, as a black wall blocks your path into its inner chambers. Perhaps the missing hunter knows something more, if he&apos;s even still alive.</string>
  <string id="46260">You have found hunter Shau, and he&apos;s clinging to a gem which precipitated the attack at the temple. If you could get a hold of it, perhaps you can lure the creature that attacked you out of hiding.</string>
  <string id="46261">The demon that attacked you has fled into the temple and disappeared after recovering from your assault. Clearly this will take more drastic measures to resolve.</string>

  <string id="46265">Henpecked Hou has told you about a large series of caves beneath this inn. With the front doors sealed, it seems there&apos;s only one possible route for escape.</string>
  <string id="46266">The cannibal master was not what he seemed. A loutish warrior being kept to act as consort for something called &quot;The Mother,&quot; he has joined you and opened a path to another cave deeper in the warren.</string>
  <string id="46268">You have cleansed the temple, and Chai Ka has opened a gate for your passage to the realm of the creature that attacked you. According to your follower, though, she is no demon, but actually a spirit of this forest.</string>
  <string id="46269">You have defeated the demon known as the Cannibal Mother and eliminated her taint on the both the forest and the Pilgrim&apos;s Rest Inn. With the spirit&apos;s help, the Great Southern Forest will quickly recover from its corruption.</string>
  <string id="46270">You have defeated the demon known as the Cannibal Mother and wiped out the Cannibals infesting the Inn. Her influence will be felt for generations, though. With the Forest Shadow dead, this forest will always remain a dark and twisted place.</string>
  <string id="46271">It seems this forest is trapping all who enter its borders. A hunter has asked for your help in escaping, and suggested that you talk to Lord Yun, the noble responsible for the Great Southern Forest, at the Pilgrim&apos;s Rest Inn.</string>
  <string id="46272">You have found and spoken to Lord Yun. He is willing to help you reach the Imperial City, but will be unable to aid you until you find a way to open the forest again.</string>
  <string id="46273">You have discovered that the true source of the forest&apos;s corruption lies in the Pilgrim&apos;s Rest Inn. If it can be dealt with, a path to the Imperial City may yet open up.</string>
  <string id="46274">You have returned to the inn only to be attacked by a group of sub-human creatures. There is no sign of Lord Yun or his proposed aid to reach the Imperial City, but there are strange noises coming from below the inn.</string>
  <string id="46275">You have escaped from the caves and defeated the &quot;mother&quot; of the cannibals. The forest should open, but you still lack a wind map, and it would be an awfully long walk to the Imperial City.</string>
  <string id="46276">Using the Lotus Assassin&apos;s wind maps, you have escaped the Great Southern Forest.</string>

  <string id="47154" soundid="154240">You would not make honorable use of anything I might say. Now, if you are done dismissing me, we should continue to the Imperial City.</string>
  <string id="47155" soundid="154241">You don&apos;t strike me as the kind who would make honorable use of what I would say, anyway.</string>
  <string id="47156" soundid="154242">It is a foolish idea. You do not understand the seductive nature of the Assassins and what they do to recruits. </string>
  <string id="47157" soundid="154243">It does not take much to make a person forget who they are. With a little effort, they can be pushed past any morals they might have claimed.</string>
  <string id="47158" soundid="154244">Cloaked in service and honor, even the most depraved of barbarity soon becomes unremarkable.</string>
  <string id="47159" soundid="154245">A naive assumption. Perhaps you can avoid direct participation, but their fanaticism will still affect you. The rot that is Death&apos;s Hand permeates the complex.</string>
  <string id="47160" soundid="154246">Perhaps you think so, but the enemy is fanatical. The rot begins high up, and it is embodied in the shell that is Death&apos;s Hand.</string>
  <string id="47163" soundid="154247">He was made our leader during the razing of Dirge. He replaced Sun Kin, who, along with the Glorious Strategist, never returned from that campaign.</string>
  <string id="47164" soundid="154248">I did not serve Death&apos;s Hand long, but when the orders came, he never questioned. The connection is more direct than loyalty... and he instills that in his Lotus Assassins.</string>
  <string id="47165" soundid="154249">That is how so many were driven to kill without cause, and why I decided no more.</string>
  <string id="47167" soundid="154250">There was more to that event--you are right to sense it--but I have kept my silence for so long that I must carefully consider the repercussions of breaking it.</string>
  <string id="47168" soundid="154251">I don&apos;t seek justification. There is more to that event than I have said, but I have kept silent for so long that  I must carefully consider the repercussions of speaking.</string>
  <string id="47169" soundid="154252">I must inevitably deal with my demons. Your destiny demands it. But I must also know that those demons will be put to rest, not exploited.</string>
  <string id="47170" soundid="154253">For many years, I did nothing. If I had known Master Li was the Glorious Strategist, so much could have been resolved, one way or another.</string>
  <string id="47171" soundid="154254">In the end, I will have to trust that you are enough his student to find a way to protect what I cannot.</string>
  <string id="47172" soundid="154255">So you claim. I am not accustomed to words having such weight. We should... we should resume your mission. You have far to go.</string>
  <string id="47173" soundid="154256">I suppose you are. I am with you, and we will see what comes. Let&apos;s get back to your mission. We have far to go.</string>
  <string id="47176">I see nothing in what they do that would scare off a killer like you.</string>
  <string id="47179">I have no further interest in your riddles, Zu.</string>

  <string id="47193" soundid="56842">But tomorrow that will be gone... shattered. The time we have now may never come again.</string>
  <string id="47194" soundid="56843">The time we have left is small. I wonder sometimes... I wonder what I would do if I knew that I would lose you tomorrow.</string>
  <string id="47195" soundid="56844">And then I remember that I have already lost you once, and I could never suffer that pain again.</string>
  <string id="47197" soundid="56846">I... I suppose I would have little choice. I just wanted to say that... to tell you....</string>
  <string id="47201" soundid="56850">I knew you would say that. I yearned for it.</string>
  <string id="47202" soundid="56851">I worry so much about what tomorrow may bring, and... and....</string>
  <string id="47205" soundid="56854">What they love... what they must not lose.</string>
  <string id="47206" soundid="56855">Whatever tomorrow may bring, we will always have tonight.</string>
  <string id="47211" soundid="56860">Yes, we do... all of us.</string>
  <string id="47214" soundid="162507">I... was approached... once or twice. The Lotus Assassins offered much, even the chance of returning my daughter. But, I assure you, I did not plan to betray you.</string>
  <string id="47215" soundid="56864">Yes, it will.</string>
  <string id="47216" soundid="56865">And when it does, everything here... this time we have together will be gone. Shattered....</string>
  <string id="47220">It is peaceful here.</string>
  <string id="47223">I will not think like that. Not with you here.</string>
  <string id="47225">I made you stronger. You would hunt me down, along with our enemies.</string>
  <string id="47226">Don&apos;t let such thoughts scare you. In time you would get over it.</string>
  <string id="47232">Anywhere I go, Dawn Star, you&apos;ll be by my side.</string>
  <string id="47241">It is all right to be scared. Only fools risk what they love with no concern.</string>
  <string id="47242">I will never let anything happen to us.</string>
  <string id="47246">That is a possibility. We do what we must.</string>
  <string id="47251">Tomorrow a great battle will come.</string>
  <string id="47252" soundid="162508">You showed me that the world... my life... is not as pointless as I once thought. My daughter is long dead. Their offer only shows how desperate you have made them.</string>

  <string id="47777" soundid="57450">I am merely following his instructions. I don&apos;t want to anger him.</string>
  <string id="47778" soundid="57451">Of course! Everyone&apos;s heard about these bandits approaching by the river.</string>
  <string id="47779" soundid="57452">Well, they&apos;d better not try to come through this gate. It&apos;s sturdy enough to keep them out, I&apos;m hoping!</string>

  <string id="47784" soundid="57457">Master Li leads this town as he does your school. It is not my place to question how he governs his students.</string>
  <string id="47785" soundid="57458">I do not anger old tigers. They have the longest teeth and most jagged claws.</string>
  <string id="47786" soundid="57459">As I have said, how Master Li chooses to govern his students is up to him. I respect his request.</string>
  <string id="47788" soundid="57461">Farewell.</string>
  <string id="47789" soundid="57462">Farewell. I wish you luck in finding Dawn Star... and Gao.</string>
  <string id="47790" soundid="57463">Not on the roads, though I hear tell the bandits that are approaching have already hurt one of the students. That&apos;s dark news that is.</string>
  <string id="47791" soundid="57464">However, Master Li does not want the school getting the kind of attention such confrontations would bring.</string>
  <string id="47792" soundid="57465">No, it&apos;s just a few raids on traveling merchants. Outlaws rarely attempt anything bolder for fear of gaining the attention of the Imperial Army.</string>
  <string id="47793" soundid="57466">But even if the danger is low, I would prefer that people not wander near the swamps without purpose. Especially students of Master Li.</string>
  <string id="47794" soundid="57467">Greetings again. I am sorry, but I am still not allowing anyone to wander the fields without cause.</string>

  <string id="47812">Has anyone ever been attacked or injured?</string>
  <string id="47815">Can I help deal with these attacks?</string>

  <string id="49178">Your customers are taking advantage of you.</string>
  <string id="49179">Would I be able to beat her record?</string>
  <string id="49181">Why does she hold the record?</string>
  <string id="49183">I could lend you some silver to get back on your feet.</string>
  <string id="49184">Is there any way to cure Kia Min?</string>
  <string id="49186">I want to ask you some questions.</string>
  <string id="49187">Let&apos;s look at your other sparring options.</string>
  <string id="49188" soundid="59880">Hiding himself away, however? That&apos;s something no one understands, and that isn&apos;t right.</string>
  <string id="49190" soundid="59307">Word is that Khana&apos;s blade will cross with yours next time you&apos;re out there. She&apos;s undefeated, you know.</string>
  <string id="49191" soundid="59308">From what people are saying, you&apos;ll get a chance to silence Soldier&apos;s bragging next. I hope you win; it would teach him some much-needed lessons.</string>
  <string id="49192" soundid="59309">Don&apos;t let their mysticism fool you; the Sung brothers are very skilled. You&apos;ll be facing them next, from what I hear.</string>
  <string id="49193" soundid="59310">You&apos;re supposed to have a shot at the Ravager next. You&apos;re the only one in recent memory who would stand a chance against that monster. Good luck.</string>
  <string id="49194" soundid="59311">Who would have thought Raging Ox could have turned into... that. Please end this. I hate to think my arena has become so corrupt.</string>
  <string id="49195" soundid="59312">I&apos;ve walked that slow walk through the loser&apos;s door more times than I can count.</string>
  <string id="49196" soundid="59313">Don&apos;t worry about losing to me. They call me Hapless, but I&apos;ve been at this a long time. Filtering out the hopefuls with no real talent, you know?</string>
  <string id="49197" soundid="59314">Not that you don&apos;t have talent, that is. You&apos;ll go far. Let&apos;s get in there and try again soon. Talk to Qui when you&apos;re ready.</string>
  <string id="49198" soundid="59315">Those trolls can be nasty. Every so often they make me tackle one of them for the crowd&apos;s amusement. It&apos;s a good show, but the stink&apos;s on you for days.</string>
  <string id="49199" soundid="59316">You&apos;ll get used to the occasional defeat here.</string>
  <string id="49200" soundid="107808">You have our collective congratulations, champion. You have done great things in this place.</string>
  <string id="49201" soundid="107809">Champion, I&apos;m humbled that I bet against you as you rose through the ranks.</string>
  <string id="49202" soundid="59319">The Bronze Division fights aren&apos;t easy, no matter what anyone says.</string>
  <string id="49203" soundid="59320">Just remember to always watch your foe. Learn from them and about them. That&apos;s really all the advice I can offer.</string>
  <string id="49204" soundid="59321">The competition&apos;s very tough where you are, and something tells me the Serpent doesn&apos;t want you to win. Don&apos;t stand for that.</string>
  <string id="49205">**TEMP** Level up description for Shooting Star Level 4 Choice 2</string>
  <string id="49206" soundid="59323">Hello again. It&apos;s a lovely day, isn&apos;t it? My bruises are healing nicely, and I really couldn&apos;t be happier.</string>
  <string id="49207" soundid="59324">You have something on your mind? I&apos;m happy to help.</string>
  <string id="49208" soundid="59325">The... Lotus Assassins? Why would you want to know about their recruiters?</string>
  <string id="49209" soundid="59326">If you must know, there are two recruiters about the city. One of them is often around here recruiting for the Executioners.</string>
  <string id="49210" soundid="59327">I hear that another has recently dirtied the pursuit of knowledge by recruiting for the Inquisitors in the Scholars&apos; Garden.</string>
  <string id="49211" soundid="59328">The Executioners are the Lotus Assassins that eliminate the problems the Inquisitors uncover. I suppose they&apos;re the more physical side of the order.</string>
  <string id="49212" soundid="59329">They investigate rumors of treason or crimes committed against the Empire. They&apos;re the more cerebral side of the order.</string>
  <string id="49213" soundid="59330">I didn&apos;t know anything until recently. One of them approached me to join their order. I refused, but I did some research. Can you believe he accused me of being a better fighter than I am?</string>
  <string id="49214" soundid="59331">I don&apos;t mind losing, but if I were better don&apos;t you think I&apos;d want to win? I&apos;ve fought against so many styles over the years, but I can never seem to make it come together.</string>
  <string id="49215" soundid="59332">The Assassins see lies and deceit everywhere. What does that tell you about them, hmm? I think they&apos;re trapped in a web of their own lies.</string>
  <string id="49216" soundid="59333">Just take my advice: Avoid the Assassins as you would an enraged Horse Lord marauder on the plains.</string>
  <string id="49217" soundid="59334">You wouldn&apos;t, would you? People don&apos;t joke about the Lotus Assassins here in the Imperial City.</string>
  <string id="49224" soundid="59341">This is about your friend and the Serpent, right? It would probably be better to ask some of the higher division fighters. I didn&apos;t hear much about it.</string>
  <string id="49225" soundid="59342">All the contestants know about the Guild. They are the real power here. Keep your voice low; we don&apos;t want Lucky Cho to hear us talking about this.</string>
  <string id="49226" soundid="59343">I don&apos;t know about the Guild itself, but around here the man in charge is named Kai Lan the Serpent.</string>
  <string id="49227" soundid="59344">I never have to deal with Kai Lan. I&apos;m not good enough to compete with the big players, so he isn&apos;t interested in me. I prefer it that way.</string>
  <string id="49228" soundid="59345">I&apos;ve heard from some of the others that they sometimes ask fighters to throw matches... or worse. </string>
  <string id="49229" soundid="59346">It may not actually be that bad, but I always advise new fighters to be careful, just in case.</string>
  <string id="49230" soundid="59347">It&apos;s not that &quot;open,&quot; but Lucky Cho and Kai Lan don&apos;t bother to hide their actions much. I wonder if the rest of the Guild appreciates them being that open.</string>
  <string id="49231" soundid="59348">As to why the Empire tolerates them, I know of at least one promising fighter who went off to join the Lotus Assassins not too long ago. </string>
  <string id="49232" soundid="59349">I don&apos;t like dwelling on the Guild. I generally pretend they&apos;re not there.</string>
  <string id="49233" soundid="59350">You&apos;re new to this arena aren&apos;t you? I&apos;m happy to help you out. Do you want to know how to sign up, or are you just curious about the events?</string>
  <string id="49234" soundid="59351">Every warrior here starts out in the qualifying round, where they face a lot of the hopefuls. If you&apos;re doing well, you&apos;ll end up facing me!</string>
  <string id="49235" soundid="59352">After that there are the Bronze, Silver, and Gold Divisions, each of which has its own champion and unique trials. I&apos;m sure Qui the Promoter can outline those for you.</string>
  <string id="49236" soundid="59353">You need to talk to Qui. He will handle all the paperwork and give you some good advice on getting started.</string>
  <string id="49237" soundid="59354">I&apos;ve never really asked. I started my career here, but I&apos;m nearly positive that the only fights that count toward your standings are the ones that take place here.</string>
  <string id="49238" soundid="59355">Sounds good to me.</string>
  <string id="49239" soundid="59356">It&apos;s always good to know who&apos;s competing at the higher levels. You&apos;re looking to the future.</string>
  <string id="49240" soundid="59357">You&apos;re already past me. Now that you&apos;re a &quot;real&quot; fighter the others will likely open up about themselves if you ask.</string>
  <string id="49241" soundid="59358">I know a little about Soldier, if you want to hear my take on him. We could also talk about Khana if you&apos;re curious about her.</string>

  <string id="49251">My concern at the palace is Master Li.</string>
  <string id="49252">There is more. Zu told me about Master Li&apos;s murdered family. The child is alive.</string>
  <string id="49257">Are you certain you are all right? I care about you.</string>
  <string id="49259" soundid="59376">He&apos;s one of the most experienced fighters here, but he&apos;s hardly a mentor. He&apos;s boastful, insulting, and a general pain. The fans love to hate him, though.</string>
  <string id="49260" soundid="59377">He is an exceptional fighter; years of military training will do that to you. He&apos;s currently the champion of the Silver Division, which tells you something about his skills.</string>
  <string id="49261" soundid="59378">That&apos;s all I can think of regarding Soldier. He keeps to himself, most of the time.</string>

  <string id="49265">**TEMP** Level up description for Shooting Star Level 6 Choice 3</string>
  <string id="49266" soundid="59383">You&apos;ve already faced her, so you&apos;d know her as well as I.</string>
  <string id="49267" soundid="59384">If you haven&apos;t already, be sure to talk to her. She told me that she will personally train the first person to defeat her.</string>
  <string id="49268" soundid="59385">She&apos;s already headed home. </string>
  <string id="49269" soundid="59386">I really respect Khana. She&apos;s undefeated, did you know? Made it all the way to Bronze Division champion without a loss.</string>
  <string id="49270" soundid="59387">I know she&apos;s from the Prosperous East, but for an easterner, she&apos;s very reserved. Easily the most disciplined of us all.</string>
  <string id="49271" soundid="59388">She&apos;s going to teach her style to the first person who can best her in the arena. People have been really excited about that, because her sword is so deadly.</string>
  <string id="49272" soundid="59389">Of course. What did you want to know?</string>
  <string id="49273" soundid="59390">I&apos;m sure you can find your way around, but I&apos;ve been here all my life. I can tell you about the scholars, the common folk, and even a bit about the Emperor himself.</string>
  <string id="49274" soundid="59391">Emperor Sun is a savior to the Empire! He created a never-ending supply of water for us. It&apos;s just too bad his daughter isn&apos;t a bit more respectful of tradition.</string>
  <string id="49275" soundid="59392">Then again, her father has changed the way things are done, so I suppose that&apos;s to be expected.</string>
  <string id="49276" soundid="59393">He&apos;s sealed himself away in the palace, when in the time of the drought he was a leader and an inspiration. </string>
  <string id="49277" soundid="59394">It&apos;s a shame that he&apos;s become so private; at his last appearance he seemed so full of life.</string>
  <string id="49278" soundid="59395">It was like he hadn&apos;t aged a day in twenty years. Perhaps trying to curtail his daughter keeps him young.</string>
  <string id="49279" soundid="59396">I agree, and I would never question the Emperor. He is a visionary leader. It&apos;s just that before, we could see where he was leading.</string>
  <string id="49280" soundid="59397">Still, I see what you&apos;re saying. Look at the endless flow of water he brought to the Empire. </string>
  <string id="49281" soundid="59398">It&apos;s new, and he changed the face of the palace to pour the water forth to the lands. </string>
  <string id="49282" soundid="59399">Princess Lian is a willful child, they say. Don&apos;t take that to mean I know her personally, but *everyone* says she&apos;s willful. To be fair, that can be good in a ruler.</string>
  <string id="49283" soundid="93180">Until later. I&apos;ll be here if you find yourself with a thirst.</string>
  <string id="49284" soundid="59401">All right.</string>
  <string id="49285" soundid="59402">I like them. Half are as crazy as a drunken chicken, but they occasionally come up with some ingenious ideas like the flyers.</string>
  <string id="49286" soundid="59403">You&apos;ll find that the most revered scholars tend to keep to their garden. Given their lively debates, that&apos;s probably safest for the rest of us.</string>
  <string id="49287" soundid="59404">Common folk from the Imperial City consider themselves superior to all other common folk, which is just silly, if you ask me!</string>
  <string id="49289" soundid="59406">The prevailing thought is that everyone outside the city has all the culture of a sunburned ox. Aside from that, the people here are the same as everywhere else. Some good, some bad.</string>
  <string id="49290" soundid="59407">I&apos;m happy to help.</string>
  <string id="49291" soundid="59408">But... why?</string>
  <string id="49292" soundid="59409">Oh. I understand. I know you&apos;re not just here for the arena, that much is clear. So be it.</string>
  <string id="49293" soundid="59410">Well, that&apos;s fine, I suppose. I was hoping to learn more from you one day, after you finished whatever it is you&apos;re doing, but that&apos;s fine.</string>
  <string id="49294" soundid="59411">I&apos;m sure we can still be friends. Thank you again for what you&apos;ve taught me. I&apos;ll be here if you need anything. Excuse me a moment.</string>
  <string id="49295" soundid="59412">I don&apos;t see why you bothered to train me if you just wanted me to become bitter. I&apos;ll not end up like you!</string>
  <string id="49296" soundid="59413">Just leave me alone. I don&apos;t want to speak with you right now.</string>
  <string id="49297" soundid="59414">Oh, good! I&apos;m relieved. Don&apos;t frighten me like that. While I calm down, is there anything else, Master?</string>
  <string id="49299" soundid="59416">That&apos;s no way to be. You need to have a positive attitude here, and in all things. Heaven provides joy for all people if only they would take it!</string>
  <string id="49300" soundid="59417">Of course it&apos;s forgotten!</string>
  <string id="49301" soundid="59418">What... are you trying to say? There&apos;s nothing wrong with a loss or two! Someone has to lose for someone to win.</string>
  <string id="49302" soundid="59419">But... I... Ah, by all thousand horns of the bull of despair, it&apos;s true, isn&apos;t it? I&apos;ve been fooling myself this whole time. Maybe I should go back to being a smith.</string>
  <string id="49303" soundid="59420">Of course, I don&apos;t see how I&apos;d be any better at that. I mean, what&apos;s the point really? It&apos;ll all rust... or just break anyway.  I&apos;ll just stay here and listen to the spectators laugh at me.</string>
  <string id="49304" soundid="59421">You&apos;d better go, though!  No need to waste your time talking to a... a pathetic loser who&apos;ll never go anywhere. Go on, it might rub off, and you don&apos;t want that!</string>
  <string id="49305" soundid="59422">I&apos;ll see you soon enough! I&apos;m looking forward to our match.</string>
  <string id="49306" soundid="59423">Right, you take care of yourself, too. Things are getting... interesting around here, with the Serpent and all. I&apos;m sure it will all work out, though!</string>
  <string id="49307" soundid="59424">Of course, Master. Good day to you.</string>
  <string id="49308" soundid="59425">It&apos;s always nice of you to stop by and chat. A lot of people who move past me in the arena never look back.</string>
  <string id="49309" soundid="59426">Right you are. Take care.</string>
  <string id="49312" soundid="107810">Great changes have come to this place. Well done, champion.</string>
  <string id="49313" soundid="107811">No matter what, you&apos;ll make a better champion than Kai Lan or the Ravager.</string>
  <string id="49315">Do you know of any recruiters for the Lotus Assassins?</string>
  <string id="49316">I&apos;m just curious. I want to be careful of them.</string>
  <string id="49317">That&apos;s my business, Han.</string>
  <string id="49319">Who are the Executioners?</string>
  <string id="49320">What is an Inquisitor?</string>
  <string id="49321">You seem to know an awful lot about the Lotus Assassins, Han.</string>

  <string id="49334">Do you know anything about a Guild?</string>
  <string id="49335">Who is in charge of the Guild?</string>
  <string id="49337">What does the Guild do, exactly?</string>
  <string id="49339">How can they operate so openly?</string>
  <string id="49341">Let&apos;s talk about something else.</string>
  <string id="49342">What can you tell me about the arena?</string>
  <string id="49343">How are the matches set up?</string>
  <string id="49345">How do I join?</string>
  <string id="49346">Are my standings carried over from other tournaments?</string>
  <string id="49347">Let&apos;s go back to my other questions.</string>
  <string id="49348">Tell me about the people who fight here.</string>
  <string id="49351">Why don&apos;t you tell me about yourself, Han?</string>
  <string id="49352">**TEMP** Level up description for Shooting Star Level 7 Choice 1</string>

  <string id="49379">How well do you know the Imperial City?</string>
  <string id="49380">I&apos;m interested in hearing about the Emperor.</string>
  <string id="49382">What kind of changes has the Emperor made?</string>
  <string id="49385">Traditions should change if they are no longer relevant.</string>
  <string id="49388">How is the Princess disrespectful of tradition?</string>
  <string id="49390">Let&apos;s go back to my other questions.</string>
  <string id="49391">What are your impressions of the Scholars?</string>
  <string id="49393">Let&apos;s hear about the commoners.</string>
  <string id="49396">Let&apos;s talk about something else.</string>
  <string id="49397">I no longer wish to consider you my student.</string>
  <string id="49398">It is for your own safety.</string>
  <string id="49400">I have nothing more I wish to teach you.</string>
  <string id="49403">I tire of your foolish optimism, that is why.</string>
  <string id="49405">Wait, forget I said that. It was a mistake.</string>

  <string id="49408">You&apos;re right. Forget I said anything.</string>
  <string id="49409">I just think you take it too far. Look at your record for fights in this arena.</string>
  <string id="49410">The mongrel known across the Imperial City as &quot;Hapless&quot; is lecturing me?</string>
  <string id="49411">You&apos;re desperate to justify your pathetic record. You are utterly worthless as a warrior, and only barely a man.</string>
  <string id="49415">That&apos;s all I need from you.</string>
  <string id="49416">Master Shin</string>

  <string id="49647" soundid="60774">Wait outside, Gao. I will finish with you later.</string>
  <string id="49648" soundid="60775"></string>
  <string id="49649" soundid="60776">Now, my student, there are many things ahead that you must discover about yourself. I trust you know the importance of your destiny?</string>
  <string id="49650" soundid="131760">But we prefer to deal with these things before they become problems. I was going to do this myself, but this could be a good opportunity to prove yourself.</string>
  <string id="49651">You&apos;re going out of business?</string>
  <string id="49652">I&apos;ll be going now.</string>
  <string id="49654">Who are you, again?</string>
  <string id="49655">Never mind. Forget I mentioned it.</string>
  <string id="49656">Maybe your standards are too high.</string>
  <string id="49657" soundid="131761">That is one solution, I suppose. But a true Inquisitor would probably seek out a more subtle solution before resorting to something so base and vulgar.</string>
  <string id="49658">I want to ask you some questions.</string>
  <string id="49659">Yes, Master. I am ready.</string>
  <string id="49663">What burden is that?</string>
  <string id="49664" soundid="131762">Minister Sheng is staying in a new Ministry hostel in the wealthy district of the city. Judge Fang spends most of his time at the arena watching the fights.</string>
  <string id="49665">Bring peace to Merchant Bai. He can be found somewhere in the Necropolis. While Shen will reward you individually, he&apos;s ultimately tasked you with destroying all three of the ghosts.</string>
  <string id="49666" soundid="144731">Perhaps I&apos;ve made my brewmaster services too available. We really should keep moving.</string>
  <string id="49671" soundid="60803">You are here! Alive! We... we thought you were dead, and then I had visions of the strangest things.</string>
  <string id="49672" soundid="60804">Dawn Star guided us to this place, but I expected a ghost, not flesh and blood.</string>
  <string id="49673" soundid="60805">It seems you have more earthly concerns in your immediate future. I estimate that the full force will be on us by tomorrow.</string>
  <string id="49675" soundid="60807">Let us hope that your courage is not unfounded. We have until tomorrow to plan before the bulk of the force will be upon us.</string>
  <string id="49677" soundid="60809">Your former master, my uncle, has taken the Jade Empire as his own. Emperor Sun Li has set the whole of his forces against us, and we are trapped here in Dirge.</string>
  <string id="49680" soundid="60812">Normally I would warn that such arrogance would bring the wrath of the heavens, but you appear to have a far more intimate understanding of them than I do.</string>
  <string id="49686" soundid="60818">You... you what?</string>
  <string id="49687" soundid="60819">My surprise is tempered by knowing that spouses and companions will follow beyond reason. Far, far beyond.</string>
  <string id="49694" soundid="60826">I... I do not know what to say.</string>
  <string id="49695" soundid="60827">You... I... you couldn&apos;t have.</string>
  <string id="49696" soundid="60828">Oooh, you walk in the parks of many gods. I will build something extra large to explode with my surprise.</string>
  <string id="49702" soundid="60834">Chai Ka: You must be of great standing in the eyes of the heavens. Mortals are not returned from beyond in their own form.</string>
  <string id="49703" soundid="60835">As annoyances go, I think ours is more pressing. Or have you all forgotten the entire army of the Emperor!</string>
  <string id="49707" soundid="60839">After you defeated my... my father... and Li struck you down, he claimed both your amulet and the heart of the Water Dragon and announced that his rule had begun.</string>
  <string id="49708" soundid="60840">The Lotus Assassins were his almost immediately. Your amulet must have allowed him to quickly do what it took my father years to accomplish. </string>
  <string id="49709" soundid="60841">We had no choice but to flee. In the days after, the new Emperor did not seem overly concerned with capturing us, and we did not know where to go.</string>
  <string id="49710" soundid="60842">That&apos;s why we came here. Dawn Star&apos;s vision seemed impossible, but any hope was better than none.</string>
  <string id="49711" soundid="60843">Only one path is passable by foot, and that is the route they are coming up. We cannot sneak past such a horde.</string>
  <string id="49712" soundid="60844">My Marvelous Dragonfly will not survive the passage, either. The winds force a certain path, and the Army&apos;s flyers are guarding it well.</string>
  <string id="49713" soundid="60845">But that is our luck, as well as our sorrow. Their inferior flyers can barely stay aloft in such currents. They will not overrun us from the air. At least, not in numbers.</string>
  <string id="49714" soundid="60846">We have a little time. They are still at the base of the mountain. I&apos;d say the main force won&apos;t be here until tomorrow.</string>
  <string id="49721">The Water Dragon returned me to life.</string>
  <string id="49727" soundid="158243">It would not have been proper for her to award it to you herself, but Princess Sun Lian requests that you accept this gift. She looks forward to your next meeting.</string>
  <string id="49728">It weakened her greatly. I must try to set things right.</string>
  <string id="49732">Why would he set the whole army against us?</string>
  <string id="49734">The Water Dragon told me it was a powerful focusing tool.</string>
  <string id="49736">There is no way of avoiding them? Sneaking? Flight?</string>
  <string id="49739">Then we will raise our defense here, and come what may.</string>
  <string id="49746">This is not the glorious task the Water Dragon said was before me.</string>
  <string id="49749">Li sends his army to do what he could not. I am not afraid of that coward.</string>
  <string id="49752">What happened after I fell to him?</string>
  <string id="49754">What? The Imperial Army is coming?</string>
  <string id="49760">Death cannot stop one as powerful as I.</string>
  <string id="49765">I came back for Sky.</string>
  <string id="49778">I came back because of you, Dawn Star.</string>
  <string id="49780">I came back because of you, Princess.</string>
  <string id="49787">Evil Spirit</string>
  <string id="49794">What have they taken?</string>
  <string id="49795" soundid="158388">Figurine? You mean that clay shtatue? Pretty little thing. *hic* I jusht borrowed it for a while. I didn&apos;t shteal it.</string>
  <string id="49796" soundid="158389">My ma ushed to have figurines like that. I ain&apos;t seen her in a long time. I really missh her. I jusht borrowed the figurine to remind me of her.</string>
  <string id="49797">You&apos;re a bad merchant if you can&apos;t protect your own goods.</string>
  <string id="49799">Is there something I could do to help?</string>
  <string id="49800">Configuration of the Dragon</string>
  <string id="49801">Configuration of the Snake</string>
  <string id="49802" soundid="158390">But I like it! My ma used to have lots of little figurines like that one. I ain&apos;t sheen her in a long time. Thish helps remind me of her.</string>
  <string id="49847">Martial Style
This style can complete a Harmonic Combo. 

Thousand Cuts is aptly named, though the style does not involve blades. A master of this style relies on numerous light strikes in quick succession instead of singular punishing blows or thunderous kicks. Most opponents reel under such a relentless assault, unable to counter fast enough to find an opening for their own attacks.</string>

  <string id="50141">Why hasn&apos;t anyone mentioned the burning of Dirge before?</string>
  <string id="50172">Chai Ka</string>

  <string id="50182">Imperial Soldier</string>
  <string id="50187">Lotus Assassin</string>
  <string id="50264" soundid="71441">I&apos;ll answer your questions first, and then you can help me with my exhaustive study of anatomy.</string>
  <string id="50267" soundid="71442">I do, however, have irrefutable proof that their grand fortress is only the second most impressive structure in the Imperial City.</string>
  <string id="50277" soundid="61691">Ugh! If this keeps up, I am going to start punching. And kicking. Those sailors will find out how good I am at biting.</string>
  <string id="50278" soundid="61692">I&apos;ll smack them so hard they&apos;ll see their own backsides.</string>
  <string id="50279" soundid="61693">I am fine. You need not worry about me. I am a peasant girl; I grew up on the farm and out in the fields. I know how to take care of myself.</string>
  <string id="50280" soundid="61694">To deal with the likes of those? Hah! Not likely. They&apos;re idiots. I&apos;m a tough girl. I grew up on the farm and out in the fields. I can take care of myself.</string>
  <string id="50281" soundid="61695">Still, I thank you for asking. It is rare these days to see someone who actually cares about others.</string>
  <string id="50282" soundid="61696">Their ship is trapped in port. It has been here for a few days. They are itching to get back on the water, but they can&apos;t. So they are going crazy and getting drunk.</string>
  <string id="50283" soundid="61697">They get worse every day. And I swear by my ancestors, I am going to kill one of them soon.</string>
  <string id="50284" soundid="61698">I don&apos;t know. Why don&apos;t you ask the authorities? Minister Sheng is in the town square, in front of the burned-out husk of his former Ministry building.</string>
  <string id="50285" soundid="61699">He is one of the most useless government officials I have ever seen, but he is not a bad man. I&apos;m sure he&apos;ll be happy to tell you why he can&apos;t possibly do anything.</string>
  <string id="50286" soundid="61700">Just go around the far side of the teahouse and follow the path up to the next hilltop. The town square is the highest part of town. </string>
  <string id="50287" soundid="61701">Their captain? He stays by his ship down at Beggar&apos;s Pier. I think he just wants to be gone from here. He tried to control them for the first few days.</string>
  <string id="50288" soundid="61702">In fact, I remember, when the ship first pulled into port, they were a very well-behaved crew. Better than most, really. But they have just been here too long.</string>
  <string id="50289" soundid="61703">You can go down to Beggar&apos;s Pier and ask the captain for yourself.</string>
  <string id="50290" soundid="61704">You don&apos;t know? Just ask around town, and you&apos;ll learn soon enough. In fact, talk to Minister Sheng in the town square. He will tell you the whole story.</string>
  <string id="50291" soundid="61705">Then you are sick. At least they have the excuse that they are drunk. You&apos;re sober, and you still think a woman likes it when men behave like that?</string>
  <string id="50292" soundid="61706">I have nothing more to say to you.</string>
  <string id="50293" soundid="61707">Then you are sick. Perhaps you like it when drunken, stinky men behave that way, but I don&apos;t. And I don&apos;t think most women do.</string>
  <string id="50294" soundid="61708">It&apos;s stupid women like you who make men think they can get away with that sort of thing. I have nothing else to say to you.</string>
  <string id="50295" soundid="61709">Goodbye. The sailors probably won&apos;t bother you, unless they get really desperate.... no, never mind. Just watch out for those sailors. They&apos;re nasty ones.</string>
  <string id="50296" soundid="61710">Goodbye. Watch out you don&apos;t run afoul of these nasty sailors. They&apos;ll hound you until you have to hurt them. Better just to avoid them.</string>
  <string id="50298">Are you okay?</string>
  <string id="50300">Do you need my help?</string>
  <string id="50302">Why are the sailors creating such a problem?</string>
  <string id="50304">Can&apos;t the authorities do anything?</string>
  <string id="50306">Where is the town square?</string>
  <string id="50307">The ship&apos;s captain can&apos;t control his sailors?</string>
  <string id="50310">Why is the ship stuck here?</string>
  <string id="50311">I think you liked the way they talked to you.</string>
  <string id="50314">Goodbye.</string>
  <string id="50355">I gained status from it. Perhaps you need to learn the value of respect.</string>
  <string id="50356" soundid="141876">Go away. You&apos;ll not have the chance to hurt me again.</string>
  <string id="50357" soundid="128082">It is a well-earned accolade. We should all be proud.</string>
  <string id="50360" soundid="128083">So you are at their beck and call? A service animal for those too weak to protect themselves. An endless, foolish road to go down.</string>
  <string id="50361" soundid="128084">I did not run, I dealt only with the bandits that got in my way. Why waste my time stomping rats into the sand?</string>
  <string id="50362" soundid="128085">There are always victims, always weaklings. You could live a thousand lives, and still someone would be begging for your help.</string>
  <string id="50364" soundid="66116">Will I? If you scum have any sense at all, you&apos;ll stand aside. Let me go drive a blade through your master&apos;s throat and I&apos;ll forget I saw you.</string>
  <string id="50365">Chumin</string>
  <string id="50412">Puzzle Box</string>
  <string id="50454" soundid="61991">What is this? We missed a couple of these pitiful students?</string>
  <string id="50455" soundid="61975"></string>
  <string id="50456" soundid="61976">I hate this. There&apos;s no challenge in killing simple peasants.</string>
  <string id="50457" soundid="61977">They said no survivors, so there better be no survivors.</string>
  <string id="50458" soundid="61978">I know, I know, but who is this for? Whoever&apos;s really giving the orders must be influential.</string>
  <string id="50459" soundid="61979">Do you want to ask Gao the Greater? No. So quit yapping and make sure there&apos;s no survivors.</string>
  <string id="50460" soundid="61980"></string>
  <string id="50461" soundid="61981">Looks like we have a few more peasants to put down.</string>
  <string id="50462" soundid="61982">Let&apos;s just make it quick.</string>
  <string id="50471" soundid="61992">This is like crushing ants. There&apos;s no end to you people.</string>
  <string id="50472" soundid="61993">The same question all the others asked. You&apos;ll get the same answer too.</string>
  <string id="50473" soundid="61994">Men! Gao the Greater wants this village cleared! Get the job done!</string>
  <string id="50474" soundid="61995">That&apos;s what the rest of your fellows said, too.</string>
  <string id="50475" soundid="61996">Just before their heads hit the ground.</string>
  <string id="50476" soundid="61997">Bah! I doubt you&apos;ve seen real bloodshed, just like the other would-be warriors in this school!</string>
  <string id="50478">Why have you done this?</string>
  <string id="50480">Monster! You&apos;ll pay for this slaughter!</string>
  <string id="50483">I&apos;m no weakling student. I will defeat you!</string>
  <string id="50485" soundid="62006">Ants? That&apos;s all their lives were to you?</string>
  <string id="50496">It was while the Emperor was indisposed. He does his best thinking in... private, you see.</string>
  <string id="50601" soundid="128086">Is that what that fat carp said? I suppose he said I am on the wrong path or don&apos;t know the Way. Garbage, all of it.</string>
  <string id="50605" soundid="62652">It&apos;s sure to be more exciting than this dead place.</string>
  <string id="50606" soundid="62653">Though impulsive, my daughter Fuyao speaks truly. The Great Dam down river has opened, the river is too low and treacherous for anyone to navigate. We are cut off from the Empire.</string>
  <string id="50607" soundid="62654">The people are starving and pirates terrorize the town. Our leader Minister Sheng seems powerless to do anything. So, we choose to try our luck in the wilderness.</string>
  <string id="50609" soundid="62656">If I could, I would stay here. I am a simple villager, and I have lived here all my life. But now, my daughter and I must venture out into the wilderness.</string>
  <string id="50611">What good would preparing for a fire that would never come do these kings?</string>
  <string id="50612" soundid="112392">This place feels all wrong. Can&apos;t you feel it? It&apos;s like the very air is unclean.</string>
  <string id="50615" soundid="62662">I have heard of the dangers: wild animals and worse men. Pirates and slavers who swoop down in their flyers on unwary travelers.</string>
  <string id="50616" soundid="62663">Some believe there are even worse things in the wilderness: ghosts that torment the living. Still, it&apos;s better than sitting in Tien&apos;s Landing waiting to die.</string>
  <string id="50618" soundid="62665">You don&apos;t know the whole story. Minister Sheng would probably pay someone to close the dam, but nobody is brave enough to make the journey. There are dark things up there.</string>
  <string id="50619" soundid="62666">Some claim it is ghosts, trying to torment us. Some think it is pirates. I don&apos;t know. All I know is that there seems to be no way to get the Great Dam closed again.</string>
  <string id="50620" soundid="62667">I don&apos;t know... Minister Sheng doesn&apos;t know. Nobody knows! But the town is dying, and I would rather try my luck out in the wilderness than stay here.</string>
  <string id="50626" soundid="108333">I agree. Perhaps I alone should speak, just to save time.</string>
  <string id="50627">Where is Fuyao&apos;s father?</string>
  <string id="50630">I will let you be on your way.</string>
  <string id="50632">Your warnings won&apos;t scare me away, peasant!</string>
  <string id="50634" soundid="127428">She died in childbirth, and the baby died with her. Her family put her in the family plot along with her son. She came up again recently, looking for revenge on me.</string>
  <string id="50639" soundid="127429">She seems to think that *I* killed her baby, or took it or something. Maybe she saw me take away the body, but she won&apos;t believe me. Every time I go near, she tries to kill me!</string>
  <string id="50640" soundid="127430">That&apos;s valuable retail space over there...</string>
  <string id="50646">Who are you?</string>
  <string id="50651">Talk to Minister Sheng</string>
  <string id="50652">Minister Sheng in the town square at the heart of Tien&apos;s Landing can give you more information about the Great Dam.</string>
  <string id="50655">Enter the Ruins to Reach the Dam</string>
  <string id="50656">Go through the ruins to the Great Dam and find some way to close it. Watch out for ghosts and the Lotus Assassins.</string>
  <string id="50657">Minister Sheng said the Lotus Assassins opened the dam to search for something in the ruins of old Tien&apos;s Landing. They don&apos;t care about the hardship they are causing the town. Sheng gave you a key to the ruins hoping you can close the dam. He also mentioned Captain Ing, a local man that would give a reward if you talk to him first.</string>
  <string id="50659">Close the Great Dam</string>
  <string id="50660">Find the Great Dam in the ruins and find some way to close it.</string>
  <string id="50661">The Lotus Assassins opened the dam to search the ruins of old Tien&apos;s. Minister Sheng gave you a key to the ruins so you can close the dam. Merchant Jiang wants the dam controls destroyed so things remain as they are. He is profiting off the misery of the locals, and can likely offer a larger reward than the Captain Ing that Sheng mentioned.</string>
  <string id="50662">The dam is closed, and the river is rising again. The town of Tien&apos;s Landing is saved, at least from their trade concerns.</string>
  <string id="50663">Sabotage the Dam</string>
  <string id="50664">Find the Great Dam in the ruins and sabotage the controls.</string>
  <string id="50665">The Lotus Assassins opened the dam to search the ruins of old Tien&apos;s. Minister Sheng gave you a key to the ruins so you can close the dam. Merchant Jiang wants the dam controls destroyed so things remain as they are.

  <string id="50667">Talk to Jiang</string>
  <string id="50668">Find Jiang in the Beggar&apos;s Pier district of Tien&apos;s Landing and give him the Jade Heart from the dam.</string>
  <string id="50669">You have destroyed the controls of the Great Dam as Merchant Jiang In Tien&apos;s Landing asked. Bring the Jade Heart, a part of the controls, to Jiang at his shop in Beggar&apos;s Pier for a reward.</string>
  <string id="50670">By sabotaging the dam, you doomed the town of Tien&apos;s Landing to a long and slow death, but at least Merchant Jiang lined your pockets with silver.</string>
  <string id="50813" soundid="97439">What&apos;s that smell? Oh, that&apos;s right, it&apos;s me.</string>
  <string id="50880" soundid="93171">I&apos;m certain you understand the ethics at stake. My knowledge of their strengths and weaknesses would be a weapon in the wrong hands.</string>
  <string id="50889" soundid="93172">Pity that you are so quick to refuse the unknown.</string>
  <string id="50890" soundid="93173">My eyes may not function, but I am not blind to the world.</string>
  <string id="50891" soundid="93174">Perhaps you should talk to Qui the Promoter. He often seeks new warriors to do battle in these ancient halls.</string>
  <string id="50897">Scholars&apos; Garden</string>
  <string id="50898">Necropolis</string>
  <string id="50902">Gao&apos;s Mercenary</string>
  <string id="50935" soundid="108334">Not this time, Princess. I will be heard.</string>
  <string id="50936">Why are you leaving town?</string>
  <string id="50939" soundid="108335">Oh, fire in the eyes. How exciting.</string>
  <string id="50942">The wilderness is very dangerous.</string>
  <string id="50944">Don&apos;t leave. Perhaps I can save the town.</string>
  <string id="50946">Your cowardice endangers your daughter. Flee, peasant.</string>
  <string id="50948">Why did the Great Dam open?</string>
  <string id="50949">Lotus Assassin</string>
  <string id="50957">I don&apos;t know what you&apos;re talking about, but I&apos;ll pass regardless.</string>
  <string id="51205">The Tournament</string>
  <string id="51213" soundid="62978">You&apos;re a stranger here, aren&apos;t you? I know everyone in Tien&apos;s Landing, and I&apos;ve never seen you before! I would remember you.</string>
  <string id="51214" soundid="62979">You should turn right around and leave this town. Trust me!</string>
  <string id="51222" soundid="62987">Forgive me, great one! I meant no offense. I only meant that you should leave our town because it is doomed. I was only trying to warn you.</string>
  <string id="51224" soundid="62989">Everything in Tien&apos;s Landing is falling apart. Sheng, the local minister, is helpless to deal with all our troubles. You should get out while you can.</string>
  <string id="51230" soundid="62995">The merchants can&apos;t buy goods from the Imperial City. The traders can&apos;t sell to the outside world. The men cannot fish, and our children go hungry.</string>
  <string id="51234" soundid="124098"></string>
  <string id="51240" soundid="63005">Um, yes, I do. Why do you ask?</string>
  <string id="51241" soundid="63006">Airship? I have only heard of such things: graceful ships that sail through the air! I&apos;ve always longed to see one, but I&apos;m just a simple peasant.</string>
  <string id="51242" soundid="63007">Perhaps Minister Sheng would know something about this. He once lived in the Imperial City; I have heard the skies above it are filled with airships!</string>
  <string id="51260" soundid="63025">What few goods the merchants have are for sale there. Things are getting better now that the dam is closed, but their stores won&apos;t be fully replenished for some time. </string>
  <string id="51261" soundid="63026">What few goods the merchants have are for sale there. They have very little, however, since the town is cut off.</string>
  <string id="51269" soundid="63034">Goodbye, mighty stranger. Please forgive my earlier impertinence. It will not happen again.</string>
  <string id="51271" soundid="63036">Greetings, mighty one. I pray this humble peasant has not insulted you again? If so, I beg your forgiveness. We have enough troubles here in Tien&apos;s Landing already.</string>
  <string id="51282">Why should I leave?</string>
  <string id="51284">You can&apos;t tell me what to do, peasant!</string>
  <string id="51288">Tell me about the troubles here.</string>
  <string id="51301">Do you have your coin purse with you?</string>
  <string id="51302">I need your silver to help me save the town.</string>
  <string id="51303">I need to find a flyer or some other kind of airship.</string>
  <string id="51314" soundid="145235">I can assure you that I no longer share an allegiance with them. It was a short dalliance that ended on poor terms.</string>
  <string id="51316">I have questions about the town.</string>
  <string id="51322" soundid="145236">I will answer what I wish.</string>
  <string id="51331">Goodbye.</string>
  <string id="51371" soundid="63219">I do not have strength to answer. I am cut open, and the way to the underworld is shut. Spirits are lost with no shepherd, no guardians. You must restore us.</string>
  <string id="51376">Corpse</string>
  <string id="51377" soundid="63225">Greetings. I am the Abbot of Three Peaks Monastery. I will be giving you your sample quest today.</string>
  <string id="51378" soundid="63226">You would have come upon my plot upon arriving at the Three Peaks Monastery and finding it in mourning.</string>
  <string id="51379" soundid="63227">Upon gaining an audience with me, I would have told you that some of my monks were murdered the night before by a Lotus Assassin. The Lotus Assassin is known to be hiding in the caves below the monastery.</string>
  <string id="51380" soundid="63228">In fact, we are standing in those very caves and the villainous murderer is the Lotus Assassin at the other end of the room.</string>
  <string id="51381" soundid="63229">I have now given you the journal entry as if you were on the quest. Check your journal page before moving forward to fight the assassin and then check it again once you&apos;ve killed him.</string>
  <string id="51382" soundid="63230">After that, come and speak with me again to resolve the quest.</string>
  <string id="51383" soundid="63231">Check your journal and then kill the Lotus Assassin and check it again. Then come and speak with me to resolve the quest.</string>
  <string id="51384" soundid="63232">You have completed the quest and I will now resolve your journal entry to its completed state.</string>
  <string id="51406">You&apos;re blind. How can you sense anything?</string>
  <string id="51429" soundid="107046">I wasn&apos;t watching.</string>
  <string id="51430" soundid="141877">This day has been full for you, and you still have the cavern to face.</string>
  <string id="51431" soundid="141878">If you listen to Lin parroting the villagers&apos; stories, that place has a dark past, but I&apos;m sure Master Li wouldn&apos;t send you into unreasonable danger.</string>
  <string id="51432" soundid="141879">You are the hero of the moment! Gao claims that he dealt with hordes of bandits, but everyone else agrees that you turned aside their main attack.</string>
  <string id="51433" soundid="141880">It is good that you were here. My foolish lack of attention forced Master Li to come to my rescue and left me with a wound that will take a few weeks to heal.</string>
  <string id="51434" soundid="141881">Master Li assures me I will heal in time. It&apos;s a shame, as Smiling Mountain was teasing me just yesterday with some &quot;special prize.&quot;</string>
  <string id="51442" soundid="141882">Smiling Mountain trains students in group combat, and just yesterday, I managed to break your record for the number of opponents faced at once.</string>
  <string id="51443" soundid="141883">He teased me by saying if I could go one higher, he might have a prize for me. I suppose he might make the same offer to you, if you&apos;re up to it.</string>
  <string id="51446" soundid="141884">If I could fight, he could likely round up enough opponents for you to make a run at a new record, but I can&apos;t face anyone with this wound.</string>
  <string id="51453" soundid="140146">You are falling behind, Gang. Grand Inquisitor Jia is not happy, therefore I am not happy. If your work does not improve, I will have to stop taking credit for it.</string>
  <string id="51454" soundid="140147">The latest battalion of golems stand idle because of you. If the production of the Jade Golem is delayed again, perhaps your soul will fuel our next attempt.</string>
  <string id="51455">I&apos;ll just leave you to that then.</string>
  <string id="51456" soundid="140148">Tonight we require a shard of exceptional quality for a Jade Golem that will control the latest battalion of golems. You will oversee this in the extraction chamber.</string>
  <string id="51457" soundid="140149">You clearly deserve better than the short life of a regular acolyte. Your ability surprised me. Use it to surprise the others as well. Help me gain the power to help you.</string>
  <string id="51461">You have any more work for me?</string>
  <string id="51463">Can we talk about the city?</string>
  <string id="51465">[Intimidation] I think I deserve a little extra compensation for my work.</string>
  <string id="51468">That&apos;s it? We just forget what Zu did and move on?</string>
  <string id="51469">Then you&apos;ll join the corpses you care for!</string>
  <string id="51471" soundid="161236">You are too valuable to abandon a second time.</string>
  <string id="51475">You have heard his lies for years. Will this change anything?</string>
  <string id="51478">Whatever. I&apos;m leaving.</string>
  <string id="51483" soundid="123243">Purveyor Shouji wants me to fetch an artifact from a tomb in the Necropolis.</string>
  <string id="51492">What is this building behind you?</string>
  <string id="51497">We&apos;ll worry about that when the time comes.</string>
  <string id="51500">What is there to do around here?</string>

  <string id="51521" soundid="72036">He should have the sense to realize he&apos;s dead and stay buried!</string>
  <string id="51525" soundid="113258">Unless I&apos;ve got a sure feeling, I always go with rolling high.</string>
  <string id="51526" soundid="113259">If you&apos;re here to play, talk to Daoshen.</string>

  <string id="51537" soundid="63396">People call me Lishun the Talkative, though I&apos;ve no idea why. I&apos;m actually a basket maker. In fact, I dare say I&apos;m the best basket maker in all of Tien&apos;s Landing!</string>
  <string id="51540" soundid="63399">My children only need one meal a day; after all, they&apos;re small. And my wife can take a third job, if necessary. I know things will turn around soon.</string>
  <string id="51550" soundid="63409">Can you imagine? They have no faith in the Emperor, nor in Minister Sheng, who is in charge of Tien&apos;s Landing. I am sure the cunning Sheng has a plan to save us.</string>
  <string id="51551" soundid="63410">He&apos;s in the town square, the highest point in Tien&apos;s Landing. Just follow any path leading up until you can&apos;t go any higher, and you&apos;re there.</string>
  <string id="51552" soundid="63411">Minister Sheng may not have the best reputation, but I&apos;m sure that&apos;s just gossip. I bet he&apos;s actually a smart, active man who can reassure you of our town&apos;s future.</string>
  <string id="51580">You have secured the acceptance of the Lotus Assassins and are free to enter their fortress deep within the tombs of the Necropolis. Somewhere in the inner chambers is the information against Death&apos;s Hand that Princess Lian wants.</string>

  <string id="51585">Find Your New Master</string>
  <string id="51586">Despite Zu&apos;s remarks, you must still find Master Gang and see if service to him will gain you access to the inner chambers and the information the princess requires.</string>
  <string id="51587">You now bear the title of Lotus Acolyte. Gaining access to the inner chambers will be a challenge with such a lowly rank, but the princess will not take you to the palace until you have the information against Death&apos;s Hand that she needs. Zu has given a cryptic warning, but he has not clarified why he left or what he is here to do.</string>
  <string id="51591">Defeat the Rampaging Ghosts</string>
  <string id="51592">Master Gang told you to defeat some ghosts unleashed by his rival, Master Shin. Gang clearly does not expect you to survive. Return to him when you are done.</string>

  <string id="51976" soundid="63916">You are on this path because you have been shaped... groomed... and the predators have been drawn away to let you pass. Can you see how that path winds towards your prey? </string>

  <string id="51979" soundid="63919">You are meant to learn, but not too much. To see, but not too clearly. To succeed, but not completely.</string>
  <string id="51980" soundid="63920">To control an outcome, control the beginning. It is godlike... the most arrogant action. That is what was done.</string>
  <string id="51981" soundid="63921">Unh...</string>
  <string id="51982" soundid="63922">I weaken... but listen. Endings come at their own pace. You would better serve your cause by asking where it began. Question why the path is there, not where it leads.</string>
  <string id="51983" soundid="63923">For now, look to yourself. The guardian ahead will test and teach. He is an ally... one you can trust. Find your purpose... fulfill your destiny, and we will meet again.</string>

  <string id="52056">How do Master Li&apos;s skills measure up to your teachers in the Imperial City?</string>
  <string id="52058" soundid="154657">The dam is downriver from us. When it was closed, it slowed the flow of the river, causing it to back up and the water level to rise.</string>
  <string id="52059" soundid="154658">But with the dam open, the water drains away too quickly and our river, the lifeblood of this town, has become a trickle. The river has no fish, and ships can&apos;t navigate it.</string>

  <string id="52113" soundid="142502">No, I have no interest in fighting you right now. I&apos;ll wait until it&apos;s worth it, when the whole school is watching and I can crush you slowly.</string>
  <string id="52114" soundid="142503">Master Li wants to talk to you. Do me a favor, and go talk to him. Then maybe I can actually receive some education at this school.</string>

  <string id="52129" soundid="145237">He is dead, and the Empire will shed no tears. He paid the price for aligning himself with Death&apos;s Hand. There is no reason to say any more than that. </string>
  <string id="52130" soundid="145238">You name the Emperor among your personal foils? You have a grand opinion of yourself. Don&apos;t be so quick to link Sun Hai to the destruction you have seen.</string>
  <string id="52131" soundid="145239">Death&apos;s Hand may still answer to him, but it is a long leap from that to assuming the Emperor approves of what the Lotus Assassins have done.</string>
  <string id="52132" soundid="145240">Both of those possibilities will be hard for people to swallow. The Emperor is the Emperor. He is above weakness or viciousness.</string>
  <string id="52133" soundid="145241">To question that is to question the nature of the Jade Empire, and I am not... not many people are willing to do that.</string>
  <string id="52135" soundid="145242">The Emperor is the foundation upon which we build. If he is weakened, we all fall.</string>
  <string id="52136" soundid="145243">There is little to tell that would affect you now. The Assassins are fanatically loyal to Death&apos;s Hand, and he uses that influence to do as he wishes.</string>
  <string id="52137" soundid="145244">He also controls the Imperial Army, but they are no longer in his favor, it seems. Mere guards in comparison to the Assassins.</string>
  <string id="52138" soundid="145245">Death&apos;s Hand was just beginning his rise to power when I left the Lotus Assassins. I do not know much more about him.</string>

  <string id="52174">He was amid a mighty forest of trees that were green despite the cold.</string>
  <string id="52176">The Emperor was raking sand in the impromptu meditation garden he&apos;d ordered constructed.</string>
  <string id="52178">He stood at the edge of a vast plain, the ground covered in snow.</string>
  <string id="52180">He stood near a great river, its banks edged with frost!</string>
  <string id="52182">He stood facing a wall of mountains, the bitter winds freezing the land.</string>
  <string id="52185">The flower guardians may blossom but the warmth of spring can hide an icy heart.</string>

  <string id="52193">No, all of this happens as we speak. Lady Fourteen Flowers has the gift of prophecy!</string>
  <string id="52197">Heaven&apos;s reach is wide. Weather is not the same in all places, Puzzle.</string>
  <string id="52202">None other than Two Drops Yi Tan, his personal food taster.</string>
  <string id="52204">Any good shops in the area?</string>
  <string id="52206">He turned to the heavens themselves, as they had already turned to him.</string>
  <string id="52208">None other than myself. I am his closest confidant.</string>
  <string id="52210">He fell to the earth, to hear its spirit sing out to him.</string>
  <string id="52212">I&apos;ll go to the fortress now.</string>
  <string id="52213">I am going to do the task for the other recruiter first.</string>
  <string id="52214">He turned to no one. Emperor Tien was alone.</string>
  <string id="52219">The Horselords proved too strong for our forces.</string>
  <string id="52221">I think Sagacious Tien just got a little bored with always winning, to be frank.</string>
  <string id="52223">There was no more land to conquer.</string>
  <string id="52225">Burning fires forced our army to turn back.</string>
  <string id="52227">A shooting star traced the border of our lands.</string>
  <string id="52243" soundid="65932">Wait, don&apos;t hurt me! I was just... hey, you&apos;re no pirate. I remember the face of everyone I used to sail with, and I&apos;ve never seen you before.</string>
  <string id="52244" soundid="65933">My name&apos;s Cheung. Once I was a pirate on the river, but things were different then. We took pride in our work. We were professionals. Not like these lazy, drunken louts!</string>
  <string id="52247" soundid="65936">Pirates are hidden away all through this lair. You shouldn&apos;t have too much trouble with them. One of Gao&apos;s new captains is around. Watch out for her; she&apos;s a tough one.</string>
  <string id="52248" soundid="65937">Up near the top, you&apos;ll find the airships and Gao himself. Maybe Inquisitor Lim, too. He&apos;s so cold he could scare a spirit back to life, then scare him dead all over again.</string>
  <string id="52253" soundid="65942">I was more than just a pirate; I was captain! I robbed and pillaged up and down these waters, but I did things differently. We sailed the waters, not the skies.</string>
  <string id="52254" soundid="65943">Ha! Did you see the looks on their faces when that cannon hit them? Now they&apos;re feeding fish at the bottom of the river!</string>
  <string id="52255" soundid="65944">Gao ruined everything. I tried to tell them, but nobody listened. You&apos;d think the Lotus Assassins would have been a warning. Even a pirate knows better than to get mixed up with them.</string>
  <string id="52257" soundid="65946">The younger pirates used to look up to me. Now they treat me like dirt! They treat me worse than that slave cleaning the pier. But I&apos;m going to get even... I&apos;ll show them!</string>
  <string id="52258">What do you know about the other pirates here?</string>
  <string id="52259">Don&apos;t worry. They won&apos;t kill me.</string>
  <string id="52261">Bah. I&apos;d rather kick in the doors that keep up this secrecy.</string>
  <string id="52262" soundid="65951">That&apos;ll teach the lazy fools to leave equipment half unloaded. They don&apos;t deserve to be called pirates! Go on, give the rope a pull and give &apos;em what they got coming!</string>
  <string id="52263">Once inside, I can take care of myself.</string>
  <string id="52268" soundid="65957">Quit wasting time! Pull the rope and wipe out everyone on the pier, or go take those guard on the dock out yourself. But whatever you do, do it quick.</string>
  <string id="52270" soundid="65959">Watch yourself in this place. One minute you&apos;re on top, the next you&apos;re on the bottom, bowing and scraping.</string>
  <string id="52271" soundid="65960">Hmph! Those pirates didn&apos;t seem to give you much trouble at all. Back in my day, a pirate knew how to fight, but these young ones are soft and weak.</string>
  <string id="52273" soundid="65962">I know this island better than anyone still alive, so I&apos;m the right one to ask. What do you want to know?</string>
  <string id="52275" soundid="65964">Then Gao came with his Lotus Assassins and airships, and suddenly my ideas were old fashioned! My men turned on me, and Gao kept me around as a broken down servant.</string>
  <string id="52278" soundid="65967">Ask away, and I&apos;ll do my best to answer. Any enemy of Gao and the Lotus Assassins is a friend of mine!</string>
  <string id="52281">Who are you?</string>
  <string id="52283">Do you have somewhere safe you can go?</string>
  <string id="52286">Sounds like a good idea.</string>
  <string id="52287">I don&apos;t need fancy tricks. I&apos;m just going to hurt them.</string>
  <string id="52292" soundid="136215"></string>
  <string id="52295">Goodbye.</string>
  <string id="52297">I want to ask you some questions.</string>
  <string id="52302">I want to ask you something else.</string>
  <string id="52303">What do you know about Gao?</string>
  <string id="52307">Any idea about what I might run across in this place?</string>
  <string id="52313">If you were a pirate, how did you end up as a servant?</string>
  <string id="52317" soundid="128088">I&apos;m done with you. Go talk to your precious master. Training will not resume until he has met with you.</string>
  <string id="52318" soundid="128089">Why should I care? I have little interest in the other students here and even less for the mud farmers outside. I am here to train, nothing more.</string>
  <string id="52319" soundid="128090">You&apos;ll soon see what I am capable of. I will make sure of it.</string>
  <string id="52320" soundid="141885">What can I do for you?</string>
  <string id="52321" soundid="128092">I see how you might think that is valuable, but are these mud farmers worth the effort? I don&apos;t think so.</string>
  <string id="52322" soundid="128093">All I care about is my ability and what I want. The cares of everyone else are not my concern.</string>
  <string id="52323" soundid="128094">You&apos;ll soon see what I am capable of. Now, go talk to your precious master. He will not resume our training until he has met with you.</string>
  <string id="52331" soundid="144732">It happened again, didn&apos;t it? You saw something? I don&apos;t like the effect this place has on you. Let&apos;s get going.</string>
  <string id="52332" soundid="144733">Oh, not the best place for a lie-down. Whatever your trouble, we need to keep moving.</string>
  <string id="52333" soundid="144734">Another momentary stumble? This could become a concern if it happens many more times. Try to keep moving.</string>
  <string id="52334" soundid="144735">You fell from the sky, but despite the maddened spirits here, you will benefit. A Spirit Monk was here long ago, fleeing the destruction that orphaned you.</string>
  <string id="52335">You have accepted First Gravedigger Shen&apos;s job to put the ghosts back in their graves. He has asked you to put to rest the spirits of Miss Chan, Merchant Bai and Mister Ren. You can find them throughout the Necropolis. He offers a reward for each one you put down.</string>
  <string id="52336" soundid="128095">Bah! I don&apos;t need the respect of the weak. If they cannot protect themselves, what good are they to me? An endless, foolish road to go down.</string>
  <string id="52337" soundid="141886">This has been a busy day for us all. Is there something you need?</string>
  <string id="52341">Smiling Mountain was right, you have the temper of a child.</string>
  <string id="52344">This from someone nobody wants help from. You are barely welcome here at all.</string>
  <string id="52363" soundid="72528">Where are my manners, though? You&apos;re the Imperial Champion, and a damn fine one, I must say.</string>
  <string id="52367" soundid="72529">Glad to have the Serpent taken care of. He was going to ruin this place before long. Now, what can Three Reach Lao do for you?</string>
  <string id="52371" soundid="72530">You&apos;re one of the arena&apos;s new contestants, and Three Reach Lao always has time for you folks. Except that oaf, Soldier.</string>
  <string id="52374">J01_TOWN</string>
  <string id="52375" soundid="72531">Well, look who it is! The new Imperial Champion, out here mucking with the common folk!</string>
  <string id="52376">Bah. Li is right to fear me now. Let them come.</string>
  <string id="52381">The weak today may be strong tomorrow. I invest so I may reap.</string>
  <string id="52382" soundid="66118">Oh, certainly! We&apos;ll sit back and let you stroll upstairs to kill our leader! Would it help if we drew you a map to his room?</string>
  <string id="52383" soundid="66119">Uh... I don&apos;t think Gao would like that.</string>
  <string id="52384" soundid="66120">I wasn&apos;t serious, you idiot! We&apos;re going to kill this intruder and go back to our drinking. He&apos;s just one man; he can&apos;t beat all of us.</string>
  <string id="52385" soundid="66121">Look around. The odds are not so much in your favor. There&apos;s still a chance for you to run.</string>
  <string id="52386" soundid="66122">What are you talking about, fool?</string>
  <string id="52387" soundid="66123">You haven&apos;t noticed my partner over there watching us? He&apos;s spent his entire lifetime learning how to kill dogs like you. This is your last chance.</string>
  <string id="52388" soundid="66124">You haven&apos;t noticed my partner over there watching us? Don&apos;t let her grace and beauty fool you; she&apos;s deadly. This is your last chance to get out of here alive.</string>
  <string id="52390" soundid="66126">So the thief brought a friend? That just means you won&apos;t die alone. Attack!</string>
  <string id="52409" soundid="66145">My name is Sky. It&apos;s good to see there&apos;s someone else in this place who can&apos;t stand these slaving dogs. We make quite the pair.</string>
  <string id="52410" soundid="66146">Indeed. I find I&apos;m just not saved enough these days. Shame, that.</string>

  <string id="52427" soundid="110016">Pardon the intrusion, but might I add the entire army of the Emperor to that list? Or is that too small a thing for your attention!</string>

  <string id="52438" soundid="110018">Chai Ka: Dawn Star was not the only one aware of your return to life. Assaulting the spirit realm has alerted Sun Li.</string>
  <string id="52439" soundid="165578">Just a few seconds.</string>
  <string id="52441">How does the mechanism work?</string>
  <string id="52443">Then what happens?</string>
  <string id="52448">Area attacks are very difficult to evade. To counter them, block by holding &lt;Block&gt; without moving the left thumbstick.</string>
  <string id="52449" soundid="110019">He didn&apos;t consider us a threat. We had no way of fighting him. Just as with Sun Hai, only a Spirit Monk can face him with hope of success.</string>
  <string id="52452" soundid="110020">Unfortunately, Emperor Sun Li sensed your stirrings in the spirit realm as well, and now we are trapped.</string>
  <string id="52455">Pillar</string>

  <string id="52457">If you betray me, I&apos;ll kill you.</string>

  <string id="52460" soundid="145843">Yes, I will have my people spread rumors of your interest. Once you pass the Silver Round, the Executioner will take an interest. I&apos;m sure he will find you as impressive as I do.</string>
  <string id="52462" soundid="145845">What is the meaning of this?</string>
  <string id="52463" soundid="145846">Hello my love. Or should I call you by your rank now, Captain Sen? Surely it&apos;s been a very long time.</string>
  <string id="52465" soundid="145848">Hmm, well, if you say so. Despite Lord Rento&apos;s insistence to the contrary, I doubt he was a master criminal. Perhaps I&apos;ll just declare Yukong&apos;s bounty a dead matter.</string>
  <string id="52466" soundid="145849">What, that mercenary? Let me have a look! Ha! Would you look at that. Uncovered by a dedicated servant of the Empire!</string>
  <string id="52468" soundid="145851">That will teach me to trust one of the Empire&apos;s hounds!</string>
  <string id="52469" soundid="145852">Here&apos;s the expanded bounty. In light of his successful capture, I&apos;ll overlook that the man almost made it out of the city.</string>
  <string id="52471" soundid="71826">He thinks that with me out of the way, he has the tannery and all my money. But I&apos;ll show him yet!</string>

  <string id="52500" soundid="66391">If it pleases you, stranger, this is a matter of great importance, and no one besides yourself can help me.</string>
  <string id="52501" soundid="66392">They&apos;ve made me a rich man, but they still have much silver to spend, and I have a large enough supply of wine to last many moons before my stocks run dry.</string>

  <string id="52507">None of your business.</string>

  <string id="52510" soundid="151743">Well, well. Is the Imperial City all you expected? It is quite a spectacle compared to the bulk of the Empire. The Marvelous Dragonfly performed perfectly, of course.</string>
  <string id="52511" soundid="66417">Oh surely you can spare just a moment to hear me out? I&apos;m direly in need of assistance, you see.</string>
  <string id="52512" soundid="66418">Once you change this scene, you change the very soul of the production! It&apos;s hardly my play at all if they perform it their way!</string>
  <string id="52513" soundid="66419">They&apos;ve changed it from a commentary of man&apos;s inhumanity to man to a satire of the Empire.</string>
  <string id="52514" soundid="66420">I&apos;m certain the Lotus Assassins would blame me for the satire.</string>
  <string id="52515" soundid="66421">Of course I would pay you. In fact, I&apos;d match... er... Well, this is odd.</string>
  <string id="52517" soundid="66423">It&apos;s just that there&apos;s no &quot;going&quot; rate for female actors or whatever you&apos;d be called. It&apos;s unheard of.</string>
  <string id="52518" soundid="66424">Of course there are, though I&apos;m not supposed to know it. The entire establishment turns a blind eye to them.</string>
  <string id="52519" soundid="66425">They deserve that much respect. I hear the bosom binding, pant stuffing, and whatnot is a far cry from comfortable.</string>
  <string id="52520" soundid="66426">The irony is that many of them get cast as the female roles--fresh faces, you see--leaving us with a woman playing a woman through four layers of costume. Most unsightly.</string>
  <string id="52521" soundid="66427">No. The whole situation leads to some interesting costuming challenges, I can tell you. There are female actors, but the establishment turns a blind eye to them.</string>
  <string id="52522" soundid="66428">Oh, by all the heavens I would never presume, madame. There are female actors, but the establishment turns a blind eye.</string>
  <string id="52523" soundid="66429">I, myself, have pushed long and hard for realism; &quot;verisimilitude&quot; is the word they&apos;re throwing out these days. And what better way to avoiding all that unnecessary shirt stuffing?</string>
  <string id="52524" soundid="66430">Alas, tradition often becomes a barrier blackened by short-sightedness that is not easily overcome.</string>
  <string id="52525" soundid="66431">I need that fire and that passion! That&apos;s what I need.</string>
  <string id="52526" soundid="66432">I don&apos;t think such drastic steps will be necessary. We have the desperation of directors on our side here.</string>
  <string id="52527" soundid="66433">No, that wouldn&apos;t be right at all.</string>
  <string id="52528" soundid="66434">I need you to take a role in the play and read the role the... er, original way.</string>
  <string id="52529" soundid="66435">Remember, you&apos;ll have to memorize your lines, no scripts on stage, of course. Also, make sure you read from this script.</string>
  <string id="52530" soundid="66436">I would most certainly pay you for your time.</string>
  <string id="52531" soundid="66437">I never attend my own plays, no. Much too nerve wracking. Someone goes for me. She is...very kind to do that. I heard how it went.</string>
  <string id="52532" soundid="66438">You do, do you? I have been asking around, you know.</string>
  <string id="52533" soundid="66439">The worst part is that the... ugh... commoners loved it. I&apos;m sure it will run for many turnings of the moon as their boorish faces laugh and laugh.</string>
  <string id="52534" soundid="66440">It will make vast amounts of silver, each coin falling like a weight upon my heart!</string>

  <string id="52552">Something the matter?</string>
  <string id="52553" soundid="151756">Well, I&apos;m judging by the smoke and the panicked state of the people that you were successful in your mission.</string>
  <string id="52554">There&apos;s NO female actors in the entire city?</string>
  <string id="52556">Sounds like a lot of unnecessary work.</string>
  <string id="52558">Do the plays only have male characters?</string>
  <string id="52560">Typical. You think women are too delicate to perform, is that it?</string>
  <string id="52563">Maybe it&apos;s time we tore down some of these traditions. What do you need me to do?</string>
  <string id="52565">If you&apos;re asking that I pretend to be a man, the answer is no.</string>
  <string id="52567">Does this mean you&apos;re not going to pay me for my help?</string>

  <string id="52601">Acquire Hunter Shau&apos;s gem.</string>
  <string id="52602">You need the gem Hunter Shau&apos;s holding on to. You could just take it, but perhaps there&apos;s some way to talk him into giving it to you.</string>

With the vigor and speed of the animal for which this martial style was named, Leaping Tiger dazzles onlookers even as it carves up opponents. Practitioners of this Martial style focus so completely on the strength and quickness of the tiger that razor-sharp claws seem to sprout from their fists. The style&apos;s quick, leaping techniques and punishing strikes create a flurry of death that can keep even armed opponents at bay. </string>

Many martial artists criticize the White Demon style for being slow and ponderous, but in the hands of a true master it can be one of the deadliest martial styles of all. While it lacks the crowd-pleasing panache of faster styles, White Demon&apos;s sheer power and intimidating techniques plow through opponents like an ogre in a teahouse. </string>

  <string id="54714">As you drew closer to the town, the source of the black pall of smoke was apparent. Two Rivers, your home since birth, burned with an unnatural intensity.</string>
  <string id="54715" soundid="161020">It&apos;s good to see that you&apos;re back safely, Min.</string>
  <string id="54716" soundid="136457">The ghosts rage and hunger for release, and such things are rich sustenance to the Mother. </string>
  <string id="54717" soundid="136458">As her strength grew, the trees changed to reflect her glory, as did we!</string>
  <string id="54730" soundid="72045">Look, I don&apos;t have time to answer any questions with that... that ghost wandering about my house, claiming he&apos;s still alive!</string>
  <string id="54731" soundid="72046">Just... just make him go away! I don&apos;t care how you do it!</string>
  <string id="54732" soundid="72047">Have you dealt with my father yet?</string>
  <string id="54733" soundid="72048">Good. Good! I&apos;m sure we can arrange some suitable form of compensation.</string>
  <string id="54734" soundid="72049">Here we go.</string>
  <string id="54735" soundid="72050">Now remember: He was just another ghost. You did him a huge favor in pushing him on to his proper place in the afterlife.</string>
  <string id="54736" soundid="72051">Since its perfectly all right, and you only did what you had to, there&apos;s no need to mention this to anyone. </string>
  <string id="54737" soundid="72052">Private family matter, you understand.</string>
  <string id="54738" soundid="72053">Now, I have things to... attend to. I must go quickly... for mourning, you understand.</string>
  <string id="54739" soundid="150764">Have you changed your mind? My offer still stands. I will happily upgrade your flyer if you accept my mission. Do you want to retrieve the supplies for me?</string>
  <string id="54740" soundid="72055">What are you doing with HIM? You were supposed to get rid of him!</string>
  <string id="54741" soundid="72056">What the hell do we need to talk about? He&apos;s dead, and you&apos;re supposed to get rid of him!</string>
  <string id="54742" soundid="72057">I&apos;m not dead! You just convinced everyone I was so you could steal the business and my money!</string>
  <string id="54743" soundid="72058">He was as good as dead anyway! Look at him! The old fart doesn&apos;t have more than a year or two left, anyway!</string>
  <string id="54744" soundid="72059">Hey!</string>
  <string id="54745" soundid="72060">Look, this doesn&apos;t have to end badly. It could work out very well for you, in fact.</string>
  <string id="54746" soundid="72061">Just make him... disappear, and I&apos;ll reward you well. Nobody needs their *deceased* relatives coming back and making trouble for the living, now do they?</string>
  <string id="54747" soundid="72062">So what if I did! He never cared about us, anyway! All he was interested in was his business... a business I should have inherited years ago!</string>
  <string id="54748" soundid="72063">You ungrateful wretch! I raised you from when you were a snot-nosed child and this is the gratitude I get?</string>
  <string id="54749" soundid="72064">I&apos;m not leaving until I get my life back!</string>
  <string id="54750" soundid="72065">How could you do this to me? I&apos;m your father, dammit!</string>
  <string id="54751" soundid="72066">Because you never loved me! It was always you and your business! Now you&apos;re getting yours, you old bastard!</string>
  <string id="54752" soundid="72067">I... I don&apos;t know what to say. How could you think that? Since your mother passed away, you were all I had.</string>
  <string id="54753" soundid="72068">[Success] I never thought... Oh, I&apos;ve been so wrong to ignore you. How could I have neglected you like that?</string>
  <string id="54754" soundid="72069">Father....</string>
  <string id="54755" soundid="72070">I&apos;m sorry, my son. I should never have neglected you all these years. When your mother passed away, I... I just didn&apos;t know what to do.</string>
  <string id="54756" soundid="72071">I hid my own feelings away in my anger and despair. I only wish I had had the eyes to see what it did to you.</string>
  <string id="54757" soundid="72072">We&apos;ve both been so wrong, father.</string>
  <string id="54758" soundid="72073">Indeed we have, and if it weren&apos;t for this stranger, this would all have likely ended in tragedy.</string>
  <string id="54759" soundid="72074">Here is the money I promised. I shall not need the task to be carried out any longer.</string>
  <string id="54760" soundid="72075">As a token of our gratitude, my son will gladly pay you the money I had promised you.</string>
  <string id="54761" soundid="72076">Ah, yes, of course. My son will gladly pay you the money I promised.</string>
  <string id="54762" soundid="72077">Yes, of course. Here it is.</string>
  <string id="54763" soundid="72078">Of course. Here is the money I promised you. Needless to say, you won&apos;t need to carry out your task.</string>
  <string id="54764" soundid="72079">Thank you for showing us the errors of our ways, stranger. May the heavens shine upon your journeys in the future.</string>
  <string id="54766" soundid="72081">[Success] He... He... Oh father, how could I have ever done this to you?</string>
  <string id="54767" soundid="72082">No... you are right to hate me. I have been a poor father.</string>
  <string id="54768" soundid="72083">Wha... No!</string>
  <string id="54769" soundid="146538"></string>
  <string id="54770" soundid="146539"></string>
  <string id="54772" soundid="72087"></string>
  <string id="54773" soundid="72088">I want him gone. I don&apos;t care how you do it.</string>
  <string id="54774" soundid="72089">Offered you... But he has no money! He&apos;s a broke, poor beggar now! I own everything!</string>
  <string id="54775" soundid="72090">Only because you convinced everyone I was dead!</string>
  <string id="54776" soundid="72091">Grr... Fine! I&apos;ll double what he&apos;s paying you if you just get rid of him! I don&apos;t care how!</string>
  <string id="54777" soundid="72092">Wha... No!</string>
  <string id="54779" soundid="72094">Ah... good. A little... messier than I had hoped for, but... as long as no one sees the blood, no one&apos;s suspicions should be raised.</string>
  <string id="54780" soundid="72095">Now, I have to dispose of his body. I&apos;ll get Shen to come by later and pick it up.</string>
  <string id="54781" soundid="72096">Here is your money. I can&apos;t have you seen around here anymore, so please leave.</string>
  <string id="54782">Are you Tanner Fong?</string>
  <string id="54783">What old man are you talking about?</string>
  <string id="54786">Gravedigger Shen told me about him.</string>
  <string id="54788">I&apos;ll deal with him for you.</string>
  <string id="54789" soundid="150765">You&apos;ve returned. Have you reconsidered? Would you like to hear my proposal now?</string>
  <string id="54790">This isn&apos;t my problem.</string>
  <string id="54791" soundid="150766">You have returned, and in one piece, I see.</string>
  <string id="54792">You mean the dead Tanner Fong? Yeah, I&apos;m here for him.</string>
  <string id="54793" soundid="150767">Not only did you retrieve my supplies, but you made quite a dent in those bandits. For that, I&apos;ll gladly pay you extra.</string>
  <string id="54795">I haven&apos;t seen him yet.</string>
  <string id="54796">How did your father die?</string>
  <string id="54799">I&apos;d like to ask you some questions.</string>
  <string id="54801">I&apos;ll get on that right away.</string>
  <string id="54802" soundid="150768">Not bad, you brought back the supplies and you took out a few bandits on your way. You can have a little bit extra for that.</string>
  <string id="54803">I made sure he&apos;ll stay down for good.</string>
  <string id="54809" soundid="150769">Well, the bandits seemed to have their way with you, but at least you brought back the supplies. Here&apos;s your payment.</string>
  <string id="54811">He&apos;s gone to his rest now.</string>
  <string id="54812">He&apos;s dead. Where&apos;s my money?</string>
  <string id="54813">I think you two need to talk.</string>
  <string id="54815">You buried him alive!</string>
  <string id="54819">He&apos;s not dead. You tried to kill him.</string>
  <string id="54822">Come on, Elder Fong, we&apos;re leaving.</string>
  <string id="54823">Then you two have to work it out yourselves.</string>
  <string id="54826">[Intuition] Elder Fong, maybe you should have talked to your son more.</string>
  <string id="54830">You two should put the past behind you.</string>
  <string id="54835">So now that you&apos;ve made up, I&apos;m still going to get paid, right?</string>
  <string id="54841">This is melodrama... I prefer tragedy. Die!</string>
  <string id="54842">[Intuition] Younger Fong, he was just trying to support you.</string>
  <string id="54845">Oh no... I see where this is going, and I&apos;m going to have to kill both of you to stop it.</string>
  <string id="54850">We&apos;re going. *Now*.</string>
  <string id="54852">Then I guess you&apos;ll have to lose it.</string>
  <string id="54853">So, you&apos;re asking me to kill him for real.</string>
  <string id="54854">You two have to figure this out for yourselves.</string>
  <string id="54855">Then I guess Elder Fong has to die.</string>
  <string id="54856">He&apos;s offered me more than you did.</string>
  <string id="54859">No, you two have to work this out yourselves.</string>
  <string id="54860">I guess that gives you one dead old man.</string>
  <string id="54861" soundid="196236"></string>
  <string id="54865" soundid="150770">There were some great flyer parts among those supplies. Would you like to have a look at them? Or, if you&apos;d prefer, I could tell you about another mission I have for you.</string>
  <string id="54887" soundid="72600">Are you ready yet? The more I think about the information you found, the more I need answers straight from my father.</string>
  <string id="54888" soundid="72601">Well, we meet again. I&apos;ve watched your progress. It seems I underestimated you in Tien&apos;s Landing.</string>
  <string id="54889" soundid="72602">I have no doubt that you will make as much of an impact on the Imperial City.</string>
  <string id="54890" soundid="72603">I understand. Our last meeting was under... interesting circumstances. You may address me as Princess Lian the Heavenly Lily.</string>
  <string id="54891" soundid="72604">It is, as you can see, customary to bow in my presence.</string>
  <string id="54892" soundid="72605">Hmm... somehow I did not expect you to kowtow so quickly. Or maybe I just hoped you wouldn&apos;t. I get so tired of fawning servants.</string>
  <string id="54893" soundid="72606">That is why I often travel without official escort, and occasionally present myself as someone less... bridled by the rules of the court.</string>
  <string id="54894" soundid="72607">You understand why I don&apos;t go into detail here in the street, don&apos;t you? With what I have to tell you, I don&apos;t want to lose that option of disguise.</string>
  <string id="54895" soundid="72608">That would be best. I trust the servants I keep, but this is best discussed away from the open street.</string>
  <string id="54896" soundid="72609">I will not speak the location aloud. Take this note. We will meet nearby, but I must have a moment to acquire... more fitting attire.</string>
  <string id="54897" soundid="72610">Very well. We will continue speaking later. I&apos;m sure we both have questions that need answering.</string>
  <string id="54898" soundid="72611">I&apos;m certain that my entourage would prefer that this take place in private. Your gruff nature is a bit too much for them.</string>
  <string id="54899" soundid="72612"></string>
  <string id="54900" soundid="72613">Don&apos;t be too long. My message concerns your master, and time is very important.</string>
  <string id="54901" soundid="72614">I have no doubt. I have questions for you as well. Hopefully, we will both be able to find the answers we need.</string>
  <string id="54902" soundid="72615"></string>
  <string id="54903" soundid="72616">That is quite enough. We will continue this at a later time. We both have questions that we will need answered.</string>
  <string id="54904" soundid="72617">Not here. I trust my personal assistants to keep their tongues, but this matter is best discussed in private.</string>
  <string id="54905" soundid="72618"></string>
  <string id="54906" soundid="72619">The whims of a member of the Imperial Court are not your concern. There are more important things that we need to discuss in private.</string>
  <string id="54907" soundid="72620">Your explanation lies in the simple bow you have given. Everyone around me kowtows low, obeying my whims. Honest opinion is rare.</string>
  <string id="54908" soundid="72621"></string>
  <string id="54909" soundid="72622">I think you are a little too bold for your own good, but I suppose it is my fault. I go out of my way to avoid fawning servants.</string>
  <string id="54910" soundid="72623">No guise, I assure you. You have the honor of addressing Princess Lian the Heavenly Lily.</string>
  <string id="54911" soundid="72624"></string>
  <string id="54912" soundid="72625">You claim great familiarity by calling me by my childhood nickname. All who know me here address me as Princess Lian the Heavenly Lily.</string>
  <string id="54913" soundid="72626">You&apos;ve already taken the arena by storm. I should have known you were destined to make a name for yourself in the Imperial City.</string>
  <string id="54914" soundid="72627">With your entrance into the arena fights, I have no doubt that you will be quite a sensation here in the Imperial City.</string>
  <string id="54915" soundid="72628">I didn&apos;t expect you and your strange training to make it to the Imperial City. You are proving to be a very interesting person.</string>
  <string id="54916" soundid="72629">Of course, I could tell that just by looking at you. You have a... very strong presence.</string>
  <string id="54917" soundid="72630">As the Heavenly Lily I am above suspicion, but I am restrained by fawning servants. Silk Fox can go anywhere, and people are not shy about their reactions.</string>
  <string id="54918" soundid="72631">There is a thrill, of course. And it allows me to find information useful to us both. Death&apos;s Hand brought your Master Li to the palace a few days ago. I saw the flyer.</string>
  <string id="54920" soundid="165870">I can&apos;t believe you are going to kill the Forest Shadow. Do you have *any* idea how much work that will cause? There&apos;s not enough paper in the universe to cover that incident!</string>
  <string id="54923" soundid="72636">He was bound in chains. He must be powerful, but I still don&apos;t believe he is Sun Li the Glorious Strategist.</string>
  <string id="54924" soundid="72637">Sun Li died twenty years ago. Everyone was told that he and Prince Kin, the third brother, fell defending the Empire. Now it seems they may have been traitors.</string>
  <string id="54926" soundid="72639">I discovered this looking through records for information on Death&apos;s Hand. Perhaps he tried to influence Sun Li and Sun Kin before corrupting my father.</string>
  <string id="54928" soundid="72641">I could take you to the palace right now, but it would do no good. Death&apos;s Hand controls what my father hears. He must be discredited for you to succeed.</string>
  <string id="54929" soundid="72642">But... your words will fall on deaf ears unless Death&apos;s Hand is first discredited. Until then, entering the palace would just endanger you with no hope of success.</string>
  <string id="54931" soundid="72644">Death&apos;s Hand has almost total control over my father. We must find conclusive evidence of his crimes and reveal his corruption. And I know how.</string>
  <string id="54932" soundid="72645">Construction on the Wall has stopped for the first time in generations. The workers now toil in factories, building powerful creatures of stone and clay called golems.</string>
  <string id="54933" soundid="72646">Death&apos;s Hand could use these automatons to seize the Empire, and my father is oblivious. We must infiltrate the Lotus Assassins and find evidence of this treachery.</string>
  <string id="54935" soundid="72648">My father may have approved the factory without considering what it could be used for. If we just tell him my suspicions, he will dismiss them.</string>
  <string id="54936" soundid="72649">We need proof of Death&apos;s Hand&apos;s intent from the seat of his power, the Lotus Assassin fortress. It would be impossible to assault, so just walk in. They are recruiting.</string>
  <string id="54938" soundid="72651">Have any Lotus Assassins who saw your face lived to report back? I doubt it. They will not recognize you as the person who fought them in Tien&apos;s Landing.</string>
  <string id="54939" soundid="72652">They have a vague description full of guesswork that has guards holding people at random. Besides, they expect an attack, not someone trying to catch their eye.</string>
  <string id="54940" soundid="72653">I would wager that you may profit from their tasks, too. Can you see the beauty in using their own methods of recruitment to fight them? I think they deserve it.</string>
  <string id="54941" soundid="72654">There are guilds within the Lotus Assassins. Executioners look for fearsome warriors. Inquisitors are more subversive, and they look for cunning in their agents.</string>
  <string id="54943" soundid="72656">You have already proven yourself in the arena. My people will spread rumors of your interest. Return to the arena, and you will be approached by the Executioner.</string>
  <string id="54944" soundid="72657">If you prove yourself in the arena, they will notice you. My people can spread rumors of your interest. The Executioner will take a real interest when you finish the Silver Round.</string>
  <string id="54945" soundid="72658">Or, if you prefer, the Inquisitor recruiter is also seeking new people. He might be open to persuasion.</string>
  <string id="54946" soundid="72659">Death&apos;s Hand rules over the Lotus Assassins, so I take special interest in their activities. I&apos;ve had most of my life to ask questions.</string>
  <string id="54947" soundid="72660">You suspect my motives? You have no reason to doubt me. If I wanted the Lotus Assassins to find you, I could simply tell them your name.</string>
  <string id="54948" soundid="72661">Yes, my people will spread rumors of your interest and the Executioner will seek you out. I&apos;m sure he will find you as impressive as I do.</string>
  <string id="54949" soundid="72662">Or, if you prefer, court the Inquisitor. Ask Scholar Dongow in the Scholars&apos; Garden about him. I hear Dongow is closer to the assassins than he should be.</string>
  <string id="54950" soundid="72663">Ask Scholar Dongow in the Scholars&apos; Garden about him. Dongow is closer to the assassins than he should be. He will tell you where to meet the Inquisitor. </string>
  <string id="54951" soundid="72664">Or seek the Executioner. My people will spread rumors of your interest, and he will approach you in the arena. They like fighters who have passed the Silver Round.</string>
  <string id="54952" soundid="72665">Unless you want me with you, I will wait at your flying machine. You travel with such interesting peasants. I&apos;m sure I&apos;ll be entertained for hours.</string>
  <string id="54953" soundid="72666">As I said, I&apos;ve had many years to examine how they work. You have no reason not to trust me.</string>
  <string id="54954" soundid="145853">Here&apos;s your bounty, as we negotiated earlier.</string>
  <string id="54956" soundid="145854">Here&apos;s the standard bounty. Accept it with the thanks of the Empire.</string>
  <string id="54957" soundid="145855">Well, that brings an end to our pursuit of two fiends. A shame I don&apos;t have more work for someone with your skills.</string>
  <string id="54958" soundid="72671">Take advantage of the fact that they don&apos;t know you as a threat! They won&apos;t know anything is wrong until you storm their lair!</string>
  <string id="54959" soundid="72672">You have already done half the work. Your performance in the arena is more than enough to catch their eyes... if you know who to talk to.</string>
  <string id="54961" soundid="72674">The Wall was started by the first emperor, Sagacious Tien, as protection against the Horselords. The Empire has long since grown past its boundaries.</string>
  <string id="54962" soundid="72675">It is now more a spiritual monument instead of a physical barrier. Every emperor has added to it. It is a legacy that has lasted millennia.</string>
  <string id="54964" soundid="72677">Prisoners of the Empire. Hard labor reforms them, and contributing to a legacy gives them purpose. Many respected citizens once worked on the Wall.</string>
  <string id="54966" soundid="72679">A wise decision. His hold over my father is nearly absolute, but if we could show conclusive evidence of his crimes, my father would have to listen. I know how.</string>
  <string id="54967" soundid="72680">The palace is protected by the Wall, which is guarded by whole garrisons. Not even birds pass over. Dragon powder turrets are manned night and day.</string>
  <string id="54969" soundid="72682">I&apos;m sorry, but the palace is fortified beyond reason, and only the official seal of the court allows passage within. You need me, and I need you.</string>
  <string id="54971" soundid="72684">I was too young to know him. I was told that he and Prince Kin, the third brother, fell defending the Empire twenty years ago. Now it seems they may have been traitors.</string>
  <string id="54972" soundid="72685">He was bound in chains. He must be powerful... or you are. There was something familiar about him, as well.</string>
  <string id="54973" soundid="72686">Why would you say that? Is that what he told you? I&apos;m sorry, but I simply cannot believe that your Master Li is the Glorious Strategist.</string>
  <string id="54974" soundid="72687">I told you back in Tien&apos;s Landing that the Emperor, my father, is not an evil man. Death&apos;s Hand has corrupted our court, and you will help me prove it.</string>
  <string id="54975" soundid="72688">I am worth trusting. With my influence, you can enter the palace and confront my father directly about Master Li, this destiny of yours, or whatever you want.</string>
  <string id="54979" soundid="72692">No one has compassion for the troubles of a princess. I am restrained by fawning servants, but as Silk Fox I can go anywhere, and no one hides their true intentions.</string>
  <string id="54980" soundid="72693">I should have seen it coming. I suspect that we share a similar strength.</string>
  <string id="54981" soundid="72694">Why haven&apos;t I seen any activity among the Lotus Assassins yet? You should talk to the contacts I gave you.</string>
  <string id="54982" soundid="72695">Remember our arrangement? You secure the evidence of the army Death&apos;s Hand is building, and I&apos;ll get you to the palace to confront my father.</string>
  <string id="54983" soundid="72696">I&apos;m sure you are, but if you did it quicker, we would all benefit. Death&apos;s Hand grows stronger, and my father grows weaker.</string>
  <string id="54984" soundid="72697">I can&apos;t agree with this. You don&apos;t know what you are getting into. You don&apos;t know the danger they represent.</string>
  <string id="54987" soundid="72700">Really? What did you see while hiding in your swamp? I&apos;ve observed Death&apos;s Hand for years, both in the palace and elsewhere.</string>
  <string id="54988" soundid="72701">You could have four faces and a different name and wardrobe for each, and you still wouldn&apos;t understand. Death&apos;s Hand is not what he seems.</string>
  <string id="54989" soundid="72702">Then what, pray tell, is he?</string>
  <string id="54990" soundid="72703">I... don&apos;t know, but his power does not come from study or skill. He is something darker, and we should not be trying to enter his lair.</string>
  <string id="54991" soundid="72704">It sounds like Sagacious Zu wants to go back into hiding. Or perhaps the nursery. Pay no attention. Not everyone is as weak as he is.</string>
  <string id="54992" soundid="72705">You don&apos;t know what they are capable of.</string>
  <string id="54993" soundid="72706">The matter is settled. Go sulk in the corner like you&apos;re accustomed to doing.</string>
  <string id="54994" soundid="72707">This is not helping anything. Are we any closer to getting to the Lotus Assassins so this accursed woman will help us find Master Li?</string>
  <string id="54995" soundid="72708">Oh, she spits fire at last. Now I see how the child left her little village; she has some spirit in her after all.</string>
  <string id="54996" soundid="72709">And she&apos;s also right. We are no closer to finding the secret plans that Death&apos;s Hand has been making. You have to move quicker.</string>
  <string id="54997" soundid="72710">Go to the Imperial Arena to meet the Executioner, or speak with Scholar Dongow in the Scholars&apos; Garden about the Inquisitor.</string>
  <string id="54998" soundid="72711">And, surprisingly, she&apos;s right. You&apos;ve made contact with the Lotus Assassins, but haven&apos;t shown them why they need to fully accept you.</string>
  <string id="54999" soundid="72712">The Inquisitor has a task for you to prove your worth. Get to it, and show him why you should be recruited.</string>
  <string id="55000" soundid="72713">You could also seek out the Executioner in the arena. He would be interested in your skill as a combatant.</string>
  <string id="55001" soundid="72714">The Executioner wants to see you excel in the arena. Progress far enough, and he will gladly recommend that you be recruited.</string>
  <string id="55002" soundid="72715">And the Inquisitor has a task for you, as well. Appeasing one or the other will be enough for our purposes. The path is yours to choose.</string>
  <string id="55003" soundid="72716">We&apos;ve gone over this. Death&apos;s Hand is using the prisoners who should be working on the Wall to construct some sort of personal army of golems.</string>
  <string id="55004" soundid="72717">My father probably knows something, but not the true danger of it. I need to show that Death&apos;s Hand intends to seize control.</string>
  <string id="55005" soundid="72718">The Lotus Assassins act for Death&apos;s Hand. There has to be proof of his evil intent in the Lotus Assassin fortress. That is where you need to go.</string>
  <string id="55010" soundid="72723">I will answer what I can, but you have other things to do, as well.</string>
  <string id="55011" soundid="72724">Your progress is admirable, but don&apos;t become too close to the Lotus Assassins. Their power is seductive. That is how Death&apos;s Hand gained influence over my father.</string>
  <string id="55012" soundid="72725">I don&apos;t understand. You have gained the favor of the Lotus Assassins with a fair amount of ease. What else is there to speak of?</string>
  <string id="55017" soundid="72730">My father? What do you want to know that isn&apos;t already public knowledge? Emperor Sun Hai is well known and well loved.</string>
  <string id="55018" soundid="72731">Death&apos;s Hand is wearing away at that reputation, however, and I need to stop him before it goes to far. </string>
  <string id="55019" soundid="72732">He has been present for as long as I can remember, but he only rose to prominence after the end of the Long Drought.</string>
  <string id="55020" soundid="72733">My father was very caring when I was a child. Now he is cold and distant. I know Death&apos;s Hand is corrupting him somehow.</string>
  <string id="55022" soundid="72735">I wish you luck. Once you have gained the trust of the Lotus Assassins, we will plan how to proceed.</string>
  <string id="55024" soundid="72737">If you prefer, you could still seek out the Inquisitor by speaking with Scholar Dongow in the Scholars&apos; Garden.</string>
  <string id="55025" soundid="72738">But she doesn&apos;t need to worry. You&apos;ve already gained the recommendation of the Lotus Assassin Inquisitor.</string>
  <string id="55026" soundid="72739">You could also go to the arena and seek the favor of the Executioner, but it isn&apos;t necessary now. A path to the Lotus Assassin fortress is open.</string>
  <string id="55027" soundid="72740">But I&apos;m sure you can appease her. You&apos;ve already gained the recommendation of the Lotus Assassin Executioner.</string>
  <string id="55037" soundid="72750">It would still be good to get some information first. Sagacious Zu might know something. We should ask him.</string>
  <string id="55038" soundid="72751">Where... where is he?</string>
  <string id="55039" soundid="72752"></string>
  <string id="55040" soundid="72753">Well, you should be more careful of who you trust.</string>
  <string id="55041" soundid="72754">That is true. I wouldn&apos;t trust any of the ragged homeless you have collected.</string>
  <string id="55042" soundid="72755">No offense meant to those of you who are actually homeless, Dawn Star.</string>
  <string id="55043" soundid="72756">If Sagacious Zu has gone to warn the Lotus Assassins, you need to move quick. If he&apos;s just run off, he is no longer our concern.</string>
  <string id="55044" soundid="72757">Zu would not turn on us.</string>
  <string id="55046" soundid="72759">The Lotus Assassin fortress is in the far end of the Necropolis. They shouldn&apos;t give you any trouble. Just appear confident as you enter.</string>
  <string id="55050" soundid="72763">Everything is in place. I&apos;ll have my evidence against Death&apos;s Hand soon enough. Oh, and you&apos;ll have access to your Master Li as well.</string>
  <string id="55051" soundid="72764">How generous of you.</string>
  <string id="55054" soundid="72767">No, don&apos;t waste your time. If he&apos;s gone to warn the Lotus Assassins, you need to move quickly. If he&apos;s just run off, he doesn&apos;t matter.</string>
  <string id="55055" soundid="72768">If that&apos;s the case, he doesn&apos;t matter, but if he&apos;s gone to warn the Lotus Assassins, you need to move quickly.</string>
  <string id="55056" soundid="72769">You don&apos;t want too much fuss. You&apos;ll only bring the place down on yourself.</string>
  <string id="55057" soundid="72770">Sagacious Zu has knowledge of the inside. At least he seems to.</string>
  <string id="55058" soundid="72771">Oh, you&apos;re fun when you&apos;re forceful. Still, you should at least get some information about the place.</string>
  <string id="55066" soundid="72779">Thank you for listening, but I want more than caution. Neither of you understand what they are capable of.</string>
  <string id="55067" soundid="72780">You aren&apos;t doing much to add to our understanding. Go sulk in the corner, like you&apos;re accustomed to doing.</string>
  <string id="55068" soundid="72781">Scholar Dongow in the Scholars&apos; Garden will alert him to your interest. Return to your base at the flyer after you have spoken with him.</string>
  <string id="55070" soundid="72783">Keep your voice down! My name is Silk Fox. I&apos;ll have a hard time helping you if my travels outside the palace become known.</string>
  <string id="55071" soundid="72784">And your flippant attitude has to change. Death&apos;s Hand grows stronger with each moment you hesitate. </string>
  <string id="55072" soundid="72785">Hello again. I enjoy our little chats, but I don&apos;t think anything has changed since we last spoke. I still need evidence against Death&apos;s Hand to free my father.</string>
  <string id="55073" soundid="72786">Meet the Executioner in the arena, or speak with Scholar Dongow in the Scholars&apos; Garden about the Inquisitor. Hurry or you&apos;ll lose your chance to help your master.</string>
  <string id="55074" soundid="72787">Well, it looks like your contact with the Lotus Assassins will be bad for your reputation but good for our goal.</string>
  <string id="55075" soundid="72788">You spoke with both of their agents, I believe. I like that you explore all the options before making up your mind.</string>
  <string id="55076" soundid="72789">Yes? I appreciate the attention, but you have things to do. You&apos;ve made arrangements to gain the trust of the Lotus Assassins but haven&apos;t followed through.</string>
  <string id="55077" soundid="72790">So, things are looking up. You&apos;ve gained the favor of the Lotus Assassins.</string>
  <string id="55078" soundid="72791">And you&apos;ve made doubly certain of it by aiding both the Executioner and Inquisitor. Very impressive. The way to the Lotus Assassin fortress is open.</string>
  <string id="55079" soundid="72792">With the recommendation of the Inquisitor, the others will welcome you as a recruit. You can slip into the very heart of their lair.</string>
  <string id="55080" soundid="72793">With the recommendation of the Executioner, the others will welcome you as a recruit. You can slip into the very heart of their lair.</string>
  <string id="55081" soundid="72794">You must go to the Lotus Assassin fortress like we agreed. Find the evidence against Death&apos;s Hand and I will help you rescue Master Li.</string>
  <string id="55122">Forgive me, but I am not sure how to address you.</string>
  <string id="55124">Of course. Forgive me, Princess.</string>
  <string id="55127">Of course, Princess Lian. Should we talk elsewhere?</string>
  <string id="55129">Of course, Princess. At your convenience.</string>
  <string id="55131">My apologies, Princess.</string>
  <string id="55132">Don&apos;t blame them for the pampering you demand.</string>
  <string id="55134">I have many questions for you.</string>
  <string id="55136">A rendezvous with the princess! Such a scandal!</string>
  <string id="55138">What information do you have for me?</string>
  <string id="55140">Bah! You just like getting your hands dirty with commoners.</string>
  <string id="55143">A common greeting, but I require an explanation. </string>
  <string id="55145">I don&apos;t bow, and I don&apos;t know you as a princess.</string>
  <string id="55148">An interesting guise. By what name should I refer to you?</string>
  <string id="55150">Silk Fox! I could have used your help getting here!</string>
  <string id="55154">You&apos;ve changed again, Princess. Who are you now?</string>
  <string id="55161">It doesn&apos;t matter what you believe. I know it, and that&apos;s enough.</string>
  <string id="55168">I must get to the palace. What do I need to do?</string>
  <string id="55172">I&apos;ve been fighting the Lotus Assassins. How can I infiltrate them?</string>
  <string id="55173">A golem factory like you describe can&apos;t be small. What if we just identified it?</string>
  <string id="55176">I&apos;ve fought a number of them. I would be spotted.</string>
  <string id="55179">How can this be done?</string>
  <string id="55184">You know a lot about the Lotus Assassins. Why?</string>
  <string id="55186">I will go see what I can learn in the Imperial Arena.</string>
  <string id="55187">I&apos;ll ask around in the arena. I&apos;ve already proven myself there.</string>
  <string id="55190">Perhaps I will see if this Inquisitor is reasonable.</string>
  <string id="55193" soundid="145856">As I said, she confined them to the poor districts. She would have been impossible to catch in that rat&apos;s nest. More frankly, there isn&apos;t enough money to make it worth my effort.</string>
  <string id="55196">I&apos;m not interested in joining my enemy!</string>
  <string id="55197">Get on with your plan. Let&apos;s see just how ridiculous it is.</string>
  <string id="55198">Why would my arena victories help?</string>
  <string id="55199">That&apos;s ridiculous! You want me to just ask to join?</string>
  <string id="55201">Tell me about the Wall.</string>
  <string id="55204">Who does the work?</string>
  <string id="55206">Destroying Death&apos;s Hand is also a priority for me.</string>
  <string id="55208">If you won&apos;t help me now, I&apos;ll find my own way to the palace. </string>
  <string id="55211">Tell me what must be done.</string>
  <string id="55214">You didn&apos;t recognize him as family?</string>
  <string id="55216">They rightfully fear him. He is Sun Li the Glorious Strategist.</string>
  <string id="55217">He is familiar because you are related. He is Sun Li.</string>
  <string id="55218">It&apos;s all your father can do to restrain him.</string>
  <string id="55219">You have to get me into the palace.</string>
  <string id="55220">I don&apos;t have time for your games. I have to rescue Master Li.</string>
  <string id="55221">You will have to prove your loyalty to me.</string>
  <string id="55228">You know nothing of strength. You are a pretender.</string>
  <string id="55230">What do I call you? Silk Fox or Princess Sun Lian?</string>
  <string id="55232">I&apos;m looking into it.</string>
  <string id="55241">Sagacious Zu will do what I say when the time comes.</string>
  <string id="55250">I want to ask more about this evidence that you want.</string>
  <string id="55253">I want to talk about you. Why has your servant given me a gift?</string>
  <string id="55257">I want to go back to my other questions.</string>
  <string id="55258">I want to talk to you about the Emperor.</string>
  <string id="55260">When did Death&apos;s Hand join your father&apos;s court?</string>
  <string id="55261">What was your father like before this began?</string>
  <string id="55262">Goodbye for now.</string>
  <string id="55278">If I did that, none of you would be here.</string>
  <string id="55293">We&apos;ll have to hunt him down!</string>
  <string id="55295">He&apos;s harmless. An old coward.</string>
  <string id="55306">Quiet, Silk Fox. He is right to advise caution.</string>
  <string id="55309">I&apos;ll do what I must regardless of you both.</string>
  <string id="55310">I will look into what the Inquisitor wants.</string>
  <string id="55313">I will see what the Executioner wants.</string>

  <string id="55809" soundid="73805">They were full of Lotus Assassins, and one *big* Assassin in black armor who seemed to be in charge. Very big. Unpleasant look on his mask.</string>
  <string id="55811" soundid="73807">They had a prisoner with them, or so I heard, and they all seemed nervous about it. The flyers left for the Imperial City soon after. Does that help?</string>

  <string id="56602">The Outlander seems convinced that your culture is lacking. It falls to you to prove him wrong.</string>
  <string id="56603">It&apos;s easy to see why the Minister of Culture wants the Outlander removed from the Scholars&apos; Garden. The man refuses to leave, and he seems determined to &quot;reform&quot; your culture, even if it takes him an eternity.</string>

  <string id="56607">In an effort to remove him from the Scholars&apos; Garden, you have challenged the Outlander to a debate. Five notables from the Scholars&apos; Garden will judge your arguments.</string>
  <string id="56609">Won debate</string>
  <string id="56612">You have countered the arguments of the Outlander through careful debate, but it will take more than skilled debate to remove him from the Scholars&apos; Garden. He has challenged you to personal combat.</string>
  <string id="56613">Lost Debate</string>

  <string id="57503" soundid="75843">I... I served him in the Imperial Army. But right now I have things you must know, so set aside your questions and listen carefully.</string>
  <string id="57504" soundid="75844">Be calm. You can be about your other tasks soon enough. For now, I have important things to tell you, so listen well. </string>
  <string id="57505" soundid="75845">Sun Li asked me to seek a piece of a special amulet he wanted you, his prize pupil, to have. It was broken apart and scattered when the Spirit Monk temple fell.</string>
  <string id="57507" soundid="75847">He intended to--and I assume he did--give the main piece to you. Rumor placed a smaller part with a fleeing apprentice monk, but it had been some years, and the trail was cold.</string>
  <string id="57508" soundid="177263">Your perception of that time is different than mine. I thought we were very lucky to have the training we did. I still do.</string>
  <string id="57511" soundid="75851">I eventually learned the monk had fled to old Tien&apos;s Landing. He was there a year or so, but died of lingering injuries and was buried with his possessions unsorted.</string>
  <string id="57512" soundid="75852">It was rushed at the time because the new dam was due to close, and old Tien&apos;s would become a watery tomb. The amulet was beyond reach, so I came here and waited.</string>
  <string id="57513" soundid="75853">Yes, Sun Li intended you to find it; I was to tell you about it if anything happened to him. It was the last order he gave me, and I have waited years to fulfill my duty.</string>
  <string id="57514" soundid="75854">Sun Li is a great man, driven by greater goals and ideals. Sometimes his gaze is lifted so high that he does not see what is right in front of him.</string>
  <string id="57515" soundid="75855">We who serve him are sometimes forgotten; left to toil in obscurity until the time to act is thrust upon us. So it was with me, waiting for you.</string>
  <string id="57517" soundid="75857">I only know that I had to find the the piece I was tracking. I did so; it is in the ruins. You must find it before the Lotus Assassins do. You will need it to help your Master.</string>
  <string id="57528" soundid="75868">The gates leading to the ruins are locked, but Minister Sheng can give you the key. You can find him in the town square, the highest point in Tien&apos;s Landing.</string>
  <string id="57530" soundid="75870">I suspect the Minister is eager to have someone investigate the opening of the Great Dam. You can use this as an excuse to get the key and explore the ruins.</string>
  <string id="57532" soundid="75872">I am unimportant, but I promised I would aid you as best I can, so ask your questions.</string>
  <string id="57533" soundid="75873">There is little to tell. I served him years ago in the Imperial Army. I was a tracker and a soldier. I was not at Dirge when it fell, but I heard the tale of Sun Li&apos;s death.</string>
  <string id="57534" soundid="75874">I revere him as a teacher and... I revere him. Even when he ordered me to distant lands, my loyalty never wavered. But I am tired. I long for an end to my service.</string>
  <string id="57535" soundid="75875">That would be a question for him, wouldn&apos;t it? I can only say that Sun Li devoted his life to raising you to one day right the wrongs in the Jade Empire.</string>
  <string id="57536" soundid="75876">If he wanted to keep some small part of his own life and thoughts for himself, who are you to question that? Everyone must have their private side.</string>
  <string id="57537" soundid="75877">I would be honored, but as a student of Sun Li you have probably learned much of it simply by watching me. Naming it will bring it together in your mind.</string>
  <string id="57541" soundid="75881">I cannot. I have done my part. I have given Sun Li my loyalty and... devotion. Now I am empty; I have nothing left. I see an end to my long service. I welcome it.</string>
  <string id="57550" soundid="75890">Remember: Go to the ruins and claim the amulet before the Lotus Assassins do. You will need it to survive the trials that lie ahead.</string>
  <string id="57551" soundid="75891">And so I step away. I have no further part to play, and I am glad for it. Perhaps history will clear my doubts and show my time was worthwhile. I wish you luck.</string>
  <string id="57556" soundid="75896">Back again? Have you been to the ruins yet? Time is running short. If you don&apos;t find the missing piece of your amulet, the Lotus Assassins will.</string>

  <string id="57572" soundid="135359">Li&apos;s wife was with child, his daughter born in the Imperial Palace while he was at Dirge. He never saw her. Within weeks of the siege, the Emperor had Li&apos;s family... executed.</string>
  <string id="57573" soundid="135360">Executed? Murdered! The Lotus Assassins were to cut them down... a mother and newborn child. I have no doubt that order came from Death&apos;s Hand himself!</string>
  <string id="57577" soundid="135362">He probably didn&apos;t think his family would be harmed, but even had he known, he might still have saved you. Li knows you have a destiny to fulfill. You&apos;re the last of your kind.</string>
  <string id="57578" soundid="177264">Fine. We won&apos;t talk. I&apos;m sorry I&apos;m not dealing with all of this as efficiently as you want. Let&apos;s just get back to what we need to do.</string>

  <string id="57595">So you searched for the rest of the amulet?</string>
  <string id="57597">Could we speed this up a little bit. Where is the monk?</string>
  <string id="57601">How do they know about it?</string>
  <string id="57602">You sound regretful.</string>

  <string id="57822">Unique Style, Drains Chi from enemies
Does direct damage in Chi Strike mode. Spirit Thief&apos;s Power Attack inflicts damage but does not drain Chi in Chi Strike mode. 

Those most adept at manipulating chi find that even the spiritual energy of others is within their grasp. The strikes and forms of the Spirit Thief style enable practitioners to tap an enemy&apos;s vital energies and refill their own reserves. While the techniques of this style do no physical damage to its victims without being charged with the user&apos;s chi, those who face a Spirit Thief master find themselves without the resolve to put their hearts into the fight.</string>
  <string id="57823">An ancient design, the spear is a length of wood topped by a sharpened head of steel. Spears have a longer reach than most martial weapons, and a master can make use of this to keep an opponent at a distance, thereby neutralizing their attacks. The spear does not offer great defense in close quarters, but a master can often end a fight long before an opponent slips inside his reach.</string>

  <string id="57873" soundid="81268">You told me that before. I suggested that you look for some other meaning behind it, but I don&apos;t presume to speak for Master Li.</string>
  <string id="57874" soundid="81269">I don&apos;t think that is possible. Are you sure you understood what he meant? Much of what he says is disguised in layers.</string>
  <string id="57875" soundid="81270">As he carried me back to the school, he told me that I was a rough diamond, and that this injury was the first cut of many.</string>
  <string id="57876" soundid="81271">Exactly. I could have let this shatter me, but instead I have learned a great deal about myself.</string>
  <string id="57877" soundid="81272">Perhaps you need to look for that kind of meaning in what he said.</string>
  <string id="57878" soundid="81273">I don&apos;t like your interpretation, and I still find comfort in his words.</string>

  <string id="57926" soundid="142167">I hear your friend has gone missing. So sad. Very sad indeed.</string>
  <string id="57927" soundid="142168">More importantly, my stock has arrived. Braving roads dangerous with ghosts and bandits, a caravan runner just dropped off a load of supplies.</string>
  <string id="57928" soundid="142169">Those thugs! I can&apos;t believe they&apos;ve come so far. They&apos;re coming up from the beach.</string>
  <string id="57929" soundid="142170">Go stop them now. It&apos;s your duty as one of Master Li&apos;s students!</string>
  <string id="57930" soundid="142171">Those bandits will think twice before threatening a town protected by the likes of Master Li. They were fools to even come here.</string>
  <string id="57931" soundid="142172">The only shame is that their ship sunk. Think what we could have done with their plunder. Ahh well, that&apos;s another opportunity lost.</string>
  <string id="57932" soundid="142173">Bandits coming here? There&apos;s precious little to steal, but I suppose they suspect we&apos;re a sleepy town with no protection.</string>
  <string id="57933" soundid="142174">Luckily, we have you fine students and your master to look over us. It does my heart good to see that you&apos;re here already, prepared to defend the town.</string>
  <string id="57934" soundid="142175">A potential customer is a welcome customer!</string>
  <string id="57935" soundid="119161">I thank you for your courtesy. A woman always likes to hear when her gifts are appreciated.</string>
  <string id="57936" soundid="142176">Oh yes, I had heard that someone was injured and immediately saw the opportunity to make vast sums of... no, to make a difference, that&apos;s it.</string>
  <string id="57937" soundid="142177">Anyway, I&apos;ve checked my stocks and I only have enough ingredients to make one dose of the salve for a poultice.</string>
  <string id="57938" soundid="142178">I&apos;m not sure how much good it will do by itself. Might take a bit of the sting away.</string>
  <string id="57939" soundid="142179">Expensive stuff that. Very pricey. Hard to acquire, too. Would certainly help her wound, but I know something just as good.</string>
  <string id="57940" soundid="142180">Get her some bearded tongue grass and she&apos;ll feel better. It won&apos;t hasten the healing any, so she&apos;ll have to take it easy, but it will deaden the pain.</string>
  <string id="57941" soundid="142181">That&apos;s good stuff, and readily available to me... and you, of course, heh. Yes, it will deaden her pain perfectly.</string>
  <string id="57942" soundid="142182">She should avoid straining herself, of course. Bearded tongue grass won&apos;t heal like red silk grass does, but why spend all that money just to speed healing?</string>
  <string id="57943" soundid="142183">If you think you can justify such opulence to heal something that time would take care of, who am I to argue? I&apos;ll just need your payment to prepare the poultice.</string>
  <string id="57944" soundid="142184">Business has been slow! What am I supposed to do? Starve?</string>
  <string id="58130" soundid="123244">Good... you came. Wait here. There&apos;s a small hole in the wall... just around the side. I&apos;ll sneak in and open the door from the inside.</string>
  <string id="58131" soundid="123245">There. The ghosts are just beyond the door. They haven&apos;t noticed me... yet.</string>
  <string id="58135" soundid="123246">I was just thinking the same thing. I don&apos;t want to get any closer to those... things.</string>

  <string id="61894" soundid="81688">If it isn&apos;t, I could talk all day and not help you.</string>
  <string id="61895" soundid="81689">Most are well liked, but as I said, there are exceptions.</string>
  <string id="61896" soundid="81690">You flatter an old man by indulging his stories more than once. I didn&apos;t think I was so interesting.</string>
  <string id="61897" soundid="81691">What would you have me speak about?</string>
  <string id="61898" soundid="81692">All my life. More years than I can remember. Very little has changed.</string>
  <string id="61899" soundid="81693">I used to grow rice. Now I live on a small stipend sent by my son. He has long since moved farther south in the Golden Delta.</string>
  <string id="61900" soundid="81694">He never comes to visit--typical--but the silver reminds me that he cares. If these bones get any more creaky, maybe I&apos;ll move down with him.</string>
  <string id="61901" soundid="81695">Good on you! History is best taught through stories. A teacher lecturing about the past is like listening to paper crumple when you want to hear a waterfall!</string>
  <string id="61902" soundid="81696">Hmm? Perhaps you think I have an affinity for spirits since I am close to becoming one myself? I&apos;m not that old yet.</string>
  <string id="61903" soundid="81697">I keep my feet toward the earth and my head as straight in the opposite direction as I can manage. I wish others were as practical.</string>
  <string id="61904" soundid="81698">I have heard many ghost stories lately. Travelers talk of roads awash in spirits. I am quicker to blame that on bowls of wine than a glut of the dead.</string>
  <string id="61905" soundid="119173">That will be meaningless if Death&apos;s Hand keeps his hold on my father&apos;s mind. I fear one day he may try to... interfere with the Imperial succession.</string>
  <string id="61906" soundid="81700">You are too young to know what it was like. A decade of thirst with all the land cracked and bare. It was worst in the great cities.</string>
  <string id="61907" soundid="81701">Riots claimed hundreds of thousands of lives. Emperor Sun Hai put all his influence toward ending the drought and saved us all, but there was a cost.</string>
  <string id="61908" soundid="119174">Or perhaps convince my father that he should be Emperor by marriage.</string>
  <string id="61909" soundid="81703">I don&apos;t know where the front line was, or the name of the enemy, but the Emperor&apos;s own brothers, Sun Kin and Sun Li, were lost.</string>
  <string id="61910" soundid="81704">As I said, the Emperor corrected whatever great offense to the heavens that had afflicted the Empire and thus ended the drought.</string>
  <string id="61911" soundid="81705">That isn&apos;t answer enough for you, I know. For the young it never is.</string>
  <string id="61912" soundid="81706">In time, you will understand that the Emperor must deal with things that you are not meant to know or comprehend.</string>
  <string id="61913" soundid="81707">I have faith in the order of things. The Emperor knows things that I am not meant to.</string>
  <string id="61914" soundid="81708">If the fisherman sends his catch to market, does the customer need to know how to fish? No, he just knows that someone else does.</string>
  <string id="61915" soundid="81709">That is the order of things. It is real, and I know it works. Ghosts and shadows are tavern tales.</string>
  <string id="61916" soundid="81710">Oh, I don&apos;t dare speak of Emperor Sun. My words can&apos;t do proper justice to his glory. He is a hero to many.</string>
  <string id="61917" soundid="81711">Ending the drought earned him great respect, even if he no longer shows his influence this far from the walls of the Imperial City.</string>
  <string id="61918" soundid="81712">I would never suggest such a thing. He must simply have greater concerns elsewhere.</string>
  <string id="61919" soundid="81713">Master Li has commented that he much prefers that Two Rivers does not get any attention. It is a sign that all is well here.</string>
  <string id="61920" soundid="81714">Goodbye. I wish you luck finding Dawn Star.</string>
  <string id="61921" soundid="81715">For now? For as long as possible. Move along.</string>
  <string id="61922" soundid="81716">I wish you well.</string>
  <string id="61923">Lina</string>
  <string id="61924" soundid="81718">Now that is not the proper tone for addressing your elders. Typical, but not the proper tone at all.</string>
  <string id="61925">If you want my respect, you&apos;re going to have to pay for it.</string>
  <string id="61927" soundid="81721">Ha! I&apos;ll say. That&apos;s the problem with youth: It&apos;s impetuous enough to charge straight on with its eyes closed and gums flapping in the breeze.</string>
  <string id="61928" soundid="81722">Oh, you&apos;ve got some spirit in you, you do! Spirit enough for an impetuous young snot who hasn&apos;t learned proper respect for elders!</string>
  <string id="61933" soundid="142510">You&apos;re finally here to talk to Master Li, are you? I certainly hope so. The old man is in there meditating, and he won&apos;t train me until he talks to you.</string>
  <string id="61934" soundid="142511">Ha! The senior student, Master Li&apos;s little lapdog, here to talk to me. My lucky, lucky day. Don&apos;t you have something more important to do?</string>
  <string id="61935" soundid="142512">You don&apos;t want my answer to that question. Go talk to one of your sandal-licking friends and let them tell you I&apos;m jealous.</string>
  <string id="61936" soundid="142513">I&apos;m sure Wen could stammer out an answer for you, something to make you feel all warm inside and just great about yourself.</string>
  <string id="61939" soundid="160207"></string>
  <string id="61941">Drunken Soldier</string>
  <string id="61942">Think carefully about how much you value your arms before you speak that way again.</string>
  <string id="61944">No, I wouldn&apos;t dishonor myself by beating a dog.</string>
  <string id="61950">Might I ask some questions?</string>
  <string id="61951">One of the students was wounded during the bandit attack.</string>
  <string id="61953" soundid="119175">Indeed we cannot. I would bite my own tongue before ever allowing that... &quot;man&quot; to touch me.</string>
  <string id="61955">Do you know anything about Dawn Star&apos;s disappearance?</string>
  <string id="61956">Are any other students missing?</string>
  <string id="61957">Have you any clue where Dawn Star would go?</string>
  <string id="61958">How many paths out of the village are there?</string>
  <string id="61960">Let&apos;s go back to my other questions.</string>
  <string id="61961">What are your thoughts on Two Rivers?</string>
  <string id="61962">Who are the important citizens?</string>
  <string id="61963">Give me your opinion.</string>
  <string id="61965">What do you know about Master Li?</string>
  <string id="61966">How did Master Li come here?</string>
  <string id="61969">Who was master before Master Li?</string>
  <string id="61972">Master Li told me he was Sun Li the Glorious Strategist.</string>
  <string id="61974">Why would it be so disruptive?</string>
  <string id="61979">How are the students viewed?</string>
  <string id="61980">What do you mean?</string>
  <string id="61982">Tell me about yourself.</string>
  <string id="61983">How long have you lived in Two Rivers?</string>
  <string id="61984">What do you do?</string>
  <string id="61986">Can we talk a bit about the past?</string>
  <string id="61987">What do you know about the spirit world?</string>
  <string id="61990" soundid="119177">You forget yourself. You should not try so hard to flatter a princess. The attentions of royalty have their own price.</string>
  <string id="61991">And yet you accept the seemingly divine end of the drought?</string>
  <string id="61992">Tell me about the Long Drought.</string>
  <string id="61994" soundid="119178">In any case, I would never allow Death&apos;s Hand such liberty. I would bite my own tongue before allowing that... &quot;man&quot; to touch me.</string>
  <string id="61996">But what really happened?</string>
  <string id="61999">You accept that, but you&apos;re too &quot;practical&quot; for ghosts?</string>
  <string id="62002">Tell me about the Emperor.</string>
  <string id="62004">Is the Emperor neglecting the borderlands?</string>
  <string id="62006">Goodbye for now.</string>
  <string id="62007">Go away and stop bothering me, you old goat.</string>
  <string id="62008">I am sorry. I spoke without thinking.</string>
  <string id="62010">It&apos;s a proper enough tone for addressing senile old fools.</string>
  <string id="62012">I&apos;m ready right now, if you dare face me.</string>
  <string id="62015" soundid="144384">Everything&apos;s lost in the translation.</string>
  <string id="62017">To the Inner Courtyard</string>
  <string id="62018">Actually, I wanted to talk to you a moment.</string>
  <string id="62019">What did I do to earn this belligerence?</string>
  <string id="62024" soundid="81818">I haven&apos;t seen or heard anything. Someone else might have time to track you students, but I don&apos;t.</string>
  <string id="62025" soundid="81819">Only one, but it passes by the swamps. You don&apos;t want to travel through there alone.</string>
  <string id="62026" soundid="81820">Too many outlaws make their home in that marsh.</string>
  <string id="62027" soundid="81821">If you wish. What do you want to know?</string>
  <string id="62028" soundid="81822">Until word of bandits, the only notable trait of this sleepy town was an unwillingness to part with its silver.</string>
  <string id="62029" soundid="81823">Who could be more important than Master Li? He is the anchor of this town, and none question his wisdom.</string>
  <string id="62030" soundid="81824">No different from anyone else. If you keep to yourself, no one bothers you.</string>
  <string id="62031" soundid="81825">Well, *you* are always asking questions. That can be tiring.</string>
  <string id="62032" soundid="81826">Although I do prefer that over Gao&apos;s posturing. He is not well liked, but his father has money, so he gets his way.</string>
  <string id="62033" soundid="81827">I&apos;ve never set my eyes beyond the horizon you can see from here. There must be someone else you could ask.</string>
  <string id="62034" soundid="81828">I send my thanks to the spirits for successful journeys just like everyone else. I don&apos;t have any special insight.</string>
  <string id="62035" soundid="81829">I grew up during the worst of it, but I don&apos;t remember much. Just the joy when the Emperor put an end to it.</string>
  <string id="62036" soundid="81830">Two Rivers was almost deserted by that time, but Master Li arrived soon after, and we&apos;ve had peace ever since.</string>
  <string id="62037" soundid="81831">I don&apos;t know. That&apos;s why the Emperor is the Emperor and I&apos;m content to be here. I don&apos;t need to worry about it.</string>
  <string id="62038" soundid="81832">There isn&apos;t much to tell. I&apos;m just a simple merchant trying to ply his trade in a town that resists spending money.</string>
  <string id="62039" soundid="180488">Or so some choose to believe. It is probably better explained by a philosopher. I know as much as any person that has seen their share of death.</string>
  <string id="62040" soundid="81834">Good luck finding Dawn Star.</string>
  <string id="62043" soundid="81837">Do come back when the weight of your silver is slowing you down! Always happy to help.</string>
  <string id="62044">Town Gate</string>
  <string id="62047" soundid="180312">You are not alone. We are also imprisoned, but if we do not resist in our own minds, we can lend our strength to you.</string>
  <string id="62056" soundid="143832">Student Si Pat probably tried to stop Gao. He paid for his duty with his life.</string>
  <string id="62057" soundid="142327">See these axes, Little man? Very soon they will be in use. If you move, I&apos;ll buy whetstones from you to sharpen them after. If you don&apos;t, I&apos;ll use your teeth.</string>
  <string id="62058" soundid="142328">Uh, yes, well, perhaps I will relocate for now. No need to get in people&apos;s way for no reason.</string>
  <string id="62059" soundid="142329">*That* is how you convince a merchant to do something. You owe me some wine.</string>
  <string id="62060" soundid="142330">This is too important. Allow me.</string>
  <string id="62061" soundid="142331">Now friend, you want to be helpful, don&apos;t you? Yes, and I want to help you. I can&apos;t do that if you put yourself in danger. Neither of us wants that, hmm?</string>
  <string id="62062" soundid="142332">Well, no, of course not. I wouldn&apos;t want to disappoint you. I&apos;ll get my wares moved right now. Sorry to be a concern.</string>
  <string id="62063" soundid="142333">*That* is how you make a man do what you want. Very useful in diplomacy.</string>
  <string id="62064" soundid="81858">Have a look for yourself.</string>
  <string id="62065" soundid="81859">I have nothing at the moment. I can&apos;t keep my stock up. People are scared to travel, which prevents goods from getting here. I must apologize.</string>
  <string id="62066" soundid="137149">And then spirited away, from the tale your lost friend told. Born while the brothers attacked this place, &quot;killed&quot; after Li was cast out. He never knew her.</string>
  <string id="62067" soundid="142541">If we&apos;re lucky, Dawn Star will bring us some sweets when she gets back!</string>
  <string id="62068" soundid="142542">Dawn Star&apos;s garden is peaceful, even when she&apos;s not here.</string>
  <string id="62069" soundid="142543">Dawn Star will be back sometime. She left us here to keep the garden safe!</string>
  <string id="62071">Gao has murdered Student Si Pat.</string>
  <string id="62076" soundid="142550">The ruins here remind me of a town I visited once... or how it looked after I left, anyway. The people were very unfriendly.</string>
  <string id="62077" soundid="142551">I didn&apos;t know I was pissing on their ancestors&apos; tombs; it was dark out. They attacked me, and now that town is one big tomb. Guess you can&apos;t piss there at all, now.</string>
  <string id="62078" soundid="142552">You gotta love pirates. All they do is drink, wench, and fight... and sometimes steal a little here and there, but nobody&apos;s perfect.</string>
  <string id="62079" soundid="142553">If we&apos;re lucky we might just find a few looking for a fight.</string>
  <string id="62080" soundid="142554">You know what I liked about Lord Yun? He didn&apos;t ask any questions. Well, that, and the silver. He was always generous with his silver. Good wine, too.</string>
  <string id="62081" soundid="142555">But mostly, I liked that he just left me alone.</string>
  <string id="62082" soundid="142556">What are you asking me for? You&apos;ve got everything you need to make that flying machine go. So, let&apos;s go, already.</string>
  <string id="62083" soundid="142557">I&apos;m looking forward to getting to the Imperial City. They&apos;ve got the cheapest wine in all the Empire... and plenty of it.</string>
  <string id="62085" soundid="143789">I always knew he would do something really bad, but this does not make sense. Poor fellow. Si Pat just had arrived here at the school.</string>
  <string id="62086" soundid="143790">One can only hope that he did not harm Dawn Star. You should hurry....</string>
  <string id="62087">Gao murdered Si Pat at the gate!</string>
  <string id="62089" soundid="143793">Since I heard of the death of that new student, I can&apos;t help but imagine Gao is behind Dawn Star&apos;s disappearance.</string>
  <string id="62090" soundid="143794"></string>
  <string id="62091">I want to ask about Dawn Star&apos;s disappearance.</string>
  <string id="62092">How many exits from the village are there?</string>
  <string id="62094">Let&apos;s go back to my other questions.</string>
  <string id="62095">I want to ask about the village.</string>
  <string id="62096">Who is important around here?</string>
  <string id="62097">How are the students viewed?</string>
  <string id="62098">Are there exceptions?</string>
  <string id="62100">I want to ask a few things about the Jade Empire.</string>
  <string id="62101">What do you know about the spirit world?</string>
  <string id="62102">Tell me about the Long Drought.</string>
  <string id="62104">How was the drought stopped?</string>
  <string id="62105">Tell me about yourself.</string>
  <string id="62106" soundid="142334">No, no, no, let me speak.</string>
  <string id="62107">Goodbye for now.</string>
  <string id="62108">What do you have for sale?</string>
  <string id="62109" soundid="142335">Look here, you are limiting your future returns by not paying attention to market fluctuation. Your customer base is about to be... ah... truncated. Violently.</string>
  <string id="62110" soundid="142336">Well, if that&apos;s the case, perhaps I should make sure to accommodate as many people as possible. I don&apos;t want to be on the losing side of... anything.</string>
  <string id="62111" soundid="142337">*That&apos;s* how you appeal to a merchant. If you don&apos;t mind me saying.</string>
  <string id="62112" soundid="142338">Now, if there is nothing else, let me be.</string>
  <string id="62113" soundid="142339"></string>
  <string id="62114" soundid="142340"></string>
  <string id="62115" soundid="142341">How much silver?</string>
  <string id="62116" soundid="142342">Well, I can certainly see the wisdom in your words now. Sorry to have been an inconvenience. I&apos;m sure we will get along wonderfully in the future.</string>
  <string id="62117" soundid="142343">Pah! Are you serious? Should I risk my neck for a pittance? Perhaps for five times that amount. Are you unfamiliar with the wrath of the Lotus Assassins?</string>
  <string id="62118" soundid="142344">Anyone here could kill me, but I am too valuable. Besides, there are witnesses over there who would tell your masters. You would be punished.</string>
  <string id="62119" soundid="142345">Plain threats are so unimaginative. Why should I keep listening to you?</string>
  <string id="62120" soundid="142346">Nothing if I want to keep my head. I serve when I am asked and act grateful when they pay me. They do what they do, and I keep my mouth shut.</string>
  <string id="62121" soundid="142347">Grand Inquisitor Jia barely tolerates me, but she sees the need for a merchant with good contacts. A golem army still needs construction materials, if not much else.</string>
  <string id="62122" soundid="142348">Goodbye.</string>
  <string id="62123" soundid="142349">Tomorrow you could be dead, but I suppose a potential customer is valuable even here. What could you want, anyway? Recruits lose their desires soon enough.</string>
  <string id="62124" soundid="142350">Eh? Hmm, you certainly have the demeanor of an Assassin. I meant no disrespect. I just didn&apos;t expect someone to need my services outside official purchases.</string>
  <string id="62125" soundid="142351">Ah, you again. What can I do for you now? Because you are a rare Assassin with your own coins, Merchant Kia Jong stands ready to serve.</string>
  <string id="62126" soundid="150879">Yes, Master Shin will be inspecting them when they arrive, but there is no sign of them yet. Perhaps they were delayed in the Necropolis.</string>
  <string id="62127" soundid="142353">My name, if you are still of a mind to care about names, is Merchant Kia Jong. What can I do for you?</string>
  <string id="62128" soundid="142354">Did you? I have a niece by that name. Is she well?</string>
  <string id="62129" soundid="137150">She was born while he and his brothers attacked this place. She &quot;died&quot; after he was cast out. He has no reason to know her, or to think that she lives.</string>
  <string id="62130" soundid="143795">Everyone knows what happened to that new student, and who caused it. Gao the Lesser was always trouble, but this is new for him.</string>
  <string id="62131" soundid="143796">After losing face by failing his challenge, Gao must have decided that honor no longer matters.</string>
  <string id="62134" soundid="143799">I&apos;ve heard about the new student. If Gao is capable of murdering someone in cold blood, he&apos;s capable of anything.</string>
  <string id="62135" soundid="143800">I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if he&apos;s the reason Dawn Star is missing. You have to find her and stop Gao.</string>
  <string id="62137" soundid="143802">Anyone could see that boy was trouble. Now it seems he&apos;s decided to fly his true colors.</string>
  <string id="62138" soundid="143803">You&apos;re the one looking for Dawn Star. Add it up in your head and tell me Gao the Lesser isn&apos;t involved in some way. Good for nothing, him.</string>
  <string id="62139">I&apos;ve learned that Gao killed one of the other students.</string>
  <string id="62142" soundid="143806">Had I spotted the boy, I certainly wouldn&apos;t have let him go by after something like that! That&apos;s just not right, killing off one of my customers.</string>
  <string id="62143" soundid="143807">Come to think of it, I did hear something odd, like someone was carrying a load and not enjoying it.</string>
  <string id="62511">You aren&apos;t the Flower of the Fields that Hing mentioned?</string>
  <string id="62519">Have either of you seen a man named Gao?</string>
  <string id="62525">I don&apos;t care who was saved. I want my reward.</string>
  <string id="62527">Take your squabbling elsewhere. I have more important things to do.</string>
  <string id="62530">I don&apos;t have time for this. How many others are here?</string>
  <string id="62532">I don&apos;t care. Some merchant offered a reward for his Flower of the Field.</string>
  <string id="62538" soundid="83340">The townsfolk commonly refer to him as Ru the *Drunken* Boatswain. He&apos;s upstairs. Actually, he might be *on* the stairs, passed out.</string>
  <string id="62540" soundid="83342">Ru left a while ago, quite drunk. He staggered down the steps and stumbled out the door. I believe he was mumbling something about Beggar&apos;s Pier. I&apos;d check there.</string>
  <string id="62546">Do you know where I can find Ru the Boatswain?</string>
  <string id="62553">Outlaw</string>
  <string id="62556">You can remain in Demon Form until you run out of Chi.</string>
  <string id="62557">Outlaw</string>
  <string id="62560">Gao&apos;s Mercenary</string>
  <string id="62563">Gao&apos;s Mercenary</string>
  <string id="62566">Merchant Hing</string>
  <string id="62569">Fen</string>
  <string id="62572">Sing</string>
  <string id="62585">Pai Zin</string>
  <string id="62590" soundid="83873">You flatter, sir. I am sorry not every student has earned such respect.</string>
  <string id="62609" soundid="83883"></string>
  <string id="62610" soundid="137136">I do what I can, but the ghosts and bandits limit travel. They viciously force many caravans to turn back.</string>
  <string id="62625" soundid="83456">Ru, I know you keep saying you&apos;ll close the Great Dam as soon as you get your courage up, but it&apos;s been three days!</string>
  <string id="62626" soundid="83457">The Great Dam&apos;s closed now. While you were lying here drinking, someone else closed it. So you need to go back to your barge on Beggar&apos;s Pier!</string>

  <string id="63813" soundid="135374">You certainly look like Li&apos;s top student, though there&apos;s something odd about how you fight. I can&apos;t put my finger on it. It doesn&apos;t matter, the sailors won&apos;t bother us again.</string>

  <string id="63815" soundid="135376">We can get back to business. Sun Li gave me instructions to await you if... if anything should happen. I have prepared for this day for well over a decade.</string>
  <string id="63817" soundid="135378">But I refused to believe he was dead. In time, my faith was confirmed. He sought me out and told me what really happened. I swore my loyalty to him on the spot.</string>
  <string id="63818" soundid="135379">I was back at the camp when I heard the sounds of battle. I got here as fast as I could, though obviously I arrived too....</string>

  <string id="63821" soundid="135382">Hui and I knew each other long ago. She was a soldier, and I... I needed her help. There was a child... an orphan. I knew Hui could find a good home for her.</string>
  <string id="63822" soundid="135383">No, you were *not.* Not everything is about you. People are living their lives across the Jade Empire, and most have no connection to you at all.</string>
  <string id="63823" soundid="135384">She was just a girl. Her parents were... dead. I couldn&apos;t look after her, and I knew Hui by reputation. I knew she would find a good home for her.</string>
  <string id="63824" soundid="135385">She&apos;s... safe. That&apos;s all you need to know; she doesn&apos;t concern you. Besides, we don&apos;t have time to worry about something that happened almost twenty years ago.</string>

  <string id="64062" soundid="134717">Sun Hai devoured my heart, but he needed time to siphon my power. He kept my body from dying, trapped between life and death, held like a trophy in his Imperial Palace.</string>
  <string id="64063" soundid="134718">That was how he ended the drought. You must find my body and kill it, so that when you defeat your former master, my power is free to dissipate. Until then, I cannot be reborn.</string>
  <string id="64065" soundid="134720">Be prepared. Sun Li will not fall as easily as his brother. The Emperor had to proceed slowly; Sun Li has used the amulet to take much more power far more quickly.</string>

  <string id="64068" soundid="134723">I have called your allies to Dirge. Not the spirit realm where we are now, but to the Dirge that exists in the mortal world. You will meet them there when you are restored.</string>
  <string id="64069" soundid="134724">I am the Shepherd of the Dead. I can restore your life, though the act will drain me of what little power I reclaimed and may expose you to even more danger.</string>

  <string id="64075" soundid="156408">You speak as if restoring Dirge was some minor task! Remember, when Dirge fell, the very essence of the Water Dragon was corrupted.</string>
  <string id="64077" soundid="134731">You have done well, mortal, but your journey is far from over. Time grows short and we must act quickly if we are to stop your Master Li.</string>
  <string id="64079" soundid="134732">Your Master, Sun Li the Glorious Strategist, betrayed you. He killed you to claim the power of the Emperor--my power--as his own. You... are dead.</string>
  <string id="64080" soundid="134733">But in the moment of your death, I seized your spirit, drawing you to this nether realm between the living and the dead.</string>
  <string id="64082" soundid="134734">I am the Water Dragon, immortal guardian of the path to the underworld. I shepherd the dead, leading them to my holy temple in Dirge, the gateway to the afterlife.</string>
  <string id="64083" soundid="134735">Once that was true. As immortal guardian of the paths to the underworld, I guided spirits through this realm. I led them to Dirge, gateway to the afterlife.</string>
  <string id="64084" soundid="134736">But twenty years ago, the Emperor and his brothers attacked Dirge. They burned my temple, slew my servants, and defiled my body so the Emperor could claim my power.</string>
  <string id="64085" soundid="134737">I no longer have the power to guide the dead; they wander aimlessly until they go mad. Only the Emperor&apos;s death spared you from a similar... unh!!</string>
  <string id="64089" soundid="134738">This is... difficult for me. I am stronger here than in the mortal world, where I could only appear to you in brief visions. But even speaking here exacts a great toll.</string>
  <string id="64090" soundid="134739">When Emperor Sun Hai fell, I reclaimed some of my power, enough to call your spirit here. But now I am fading once more. Sun Li consumes my energy.</string>
  <string id="64091" soundid="134740">Your former Master has long desired power, to impose his will on the Empire. His plan took years to form, but the prize was too grand to let go to waste on his brother&apos;s madness.</string>
  <string id="64092" soundid="134741">He consumes my essence to become a god, but he does not yet fully control his power. That is why I could bring you here, and why we can speak now.</string>
  <string id="64093" soundid="134742">My strength wanes. We must act quickly. For you to fulfill your destiny, I must send you to Dirge *now,* while Sun Li struggles to control his new found power.</string>
  <string id="64094" soundid="134743">The Glorious Strategist knows patience. Li has planned this for twenty years. When Dirge fell, he rescued you only because he believed you were a tool he could use.</string>
  <string id="64095" soundid="134744">The Emperor claimed my power. Only a Spirit Monk could face him. Li came to know this, so he raised you, trained you... and cast you aside when your task was done.</string>
  <string id="64096" soundid="134745">You will learn this and more, but we must move quickly. When he discovers what I have done, he will try to seal this realm and prevent me from sending you to Dirge.</string>
  <string id="64097" soundid="134746">You are the last of the Spirit Monks, sworn guardians of the Water Dragon! You are bound by the legacy of your ancestors to undo what the Emperor and Li have done!</string>
  <string id="64098" soundid="134747">My temple at Dirge is defiled. I do not have the power to restore you to life. But I can send your spirit to Dirge, so you may cleanse the taint corrupting my holy sanctum.</string>
  <string id="64099" soundid="134748">Hurry! If you restore the fountains of Dirge, I can restore you to life. If you do not, Master Li will become... unstoppable!</string>
  <string id="64100" soundid="134749">There is... no time. Go to Dirge before Li seals the portal.</string>
  <string id="64101" soundid="134750">Be wary in Dirge. It is corrupted; dark spirits lurk there. You will need all the abilities you command... for they are yours even without the amulet. I will explain when I am able.</string>
  <string id="64102" soundid="134751">Seek out... Abbot Song. He will help you. Restore... the fountains of Dirge. Restore my... restore my power, and I will speak to you again....</string>

  <string id="64115" soundid="127482">You do that. Now if there&apos;s nothing else...?</string>
  <string id="64127" soundid="109987">Under protest! Gao does not appreciate what I make. He misuses, and worse, he duplicates and diminishes their glory. Well, no more. The Dragonfly will not function.</string>
  <string id="64128" soundid="109988">Ah, but you should! I can... I can make the Dragonfly work for you... maybe. Better you than Gao. He misuses my creations, diminishing their glory through duplication.</string>
  <string id="64129" soundid="127483">Well, you know where to find me.</string>
  <string id="64138" soundid="127484">Did you hear that rumbling? It must have shook the entire hill! The Emperor&apos;s Tomb... it&apos;s... it&apos;s collapsed!</string>
  <string id="64183" soundid="127485">I don&apos;t doubt it. They could probably feel it all over the city!</string>
  <string id="64185" soundid="127486">It is a bad omen, there&apos;s no doubt about that. The Emperor&apos;s own tomb... I fear the spirits will be even more troublesome after this.</string>
  <string id="64187" soundid="127487">Maybe I should consider a job in the countryside.</string>
  <string id="64190" soundid="127488">Is there anything else you need?</string>
  <string id="64191" soundid="127489">I know it&apos;s more dangerous now, but have you reconsidered the job offer? You want it?</string>
  <string id="64195" soundid="127490">Ha! You seem confident about your abilities, but some things are beyond the scope of mere mortals.</string>
  <string id="64196" soundid="126874">A farm, eh? I&apos;ve spent my whole life living in the town. I&apos;m not sure I want to leave Tien&apos;s Landing.</string>
  <string id="64197" soundid="126875">[Success] I can&apos;t argue with that. And I&apos;m the kind of woman who doesn&apos;t mind getting her hands dirty with a little hard work.</string>
  <string id="64202" soundid="126876">That&apos;s good, &apos;cause sometimes you get real dirty out on the farm. &apos;Specially when it rains.</string>
  <string id="64203" soundid="126877">I think I&apos;d like to talk to Tian a little bit more... in private. We need to get to know each other better.</string>
  <string id="64204" soundid="127491">How could I not notice? They probably felt it all across the city!</string>
  <string id="64219" soundid="136148">He doesn&apos;t understand that multiples diminish the glory of any creation, weakening them all. The Marvelous Dragonfly deserves better. I&apos;ll take my chances with you.</string>
  <string id="64241" soundid="109989">Gao wants to give my machine to the Lotus Assassins. But I stopped him. I hid the Extraneous Dust Inductor where no one will find it. Ha! Try to fly without that!</string>

  <string id="66910">
Many tales circulate of the travels of the Water People, but one of the most disturbing tales comes from far to the west, beyond the Ocean of Tempus. Rumors persist of an area in the middle of the western ocean that is inhospitable to life. The farther one travels across the Ocean of Tempus, the warmer the climate becomes. Many have postulated that this may be because you approach the resting place of the sun, but there must be another explanation, not shrouded in myths and superstition.

Of particular note are reports of an enormous cloud that rises miles into the air, visible to those few brave enough to travel the increasingly rough seas of Tempus. At night, this cloud glows with heat, and its acrid smell carries on the wind. Those who approach too closely fall ill. The few ghost ships found in that area were filled with desiccated corpses, their skin rotting and their hair and teeth falling from their bodies. One particularly disturbing log, penned in the shaking hand of a dying captain of one of these lost craft, suggests that the skies were filled with a roar like the cries of the gods, and it finishes with the unfortunate man&apos;s wish that death take him before the howling demons descend upon him.</string>
  <string id="66911">The Undertow</string>
  <string id="66912">
The farther east one goes across the Ocean of Glass, the colder and drier the air becomes. Modern scholars have struggled to understand this phenomenon, but to no avail. If one travels far enough, the sea currents all change, drawing east, just as all winds begin to draw in the same direction. Myths persist, however, of something greater, an ancient devouring evil detailed in the legends of the barbarian savages who line among the isles of the Glass Ocean. The legends tell of a voracious creature, a great demon trying to draw the entire world into its maw. An expedition sent during the Star Dynasty to discover the truth of these legends never returned and was presumed lost at sea.</string>
  <string id="66913">The Mysterious East</string>
  <string id="66914">
Scholars know little about the culture that lies across the Glass Ocean. The tribes of that land have a sizeable amount of gold and a near insatiable demand for silk and spices. They also seem able to manufacture metals to an astounding degree, though perhaps not in as sophisticated a manner as our master tradesmen. Still, something on the other side of the Glass Ocean bears investigation. Unfortunately, few trade fleets have ever successfully made the passage, and those trade caravans that do pass follow a circuitous route through unenlightened peoples hostile to the Jade Empire.</string>

  <string id="67095" soundid="132427">Unless... wait! Minister Sheng has a plan! The real problem here is Judge Fang, not me. If he were... removed, then Minister Sheng would no longer be in danger!</string>
  <string id="67096" soundid="132428">Minister Sheng is not suggesting anything. In fact, Minister Sheng wants no part of this at all. I had quite enough of the Lotus Assassins back in Tien&apos;s Landing!</string>
  <string id="67097" soundid="132429">However, I will point out that if Judge Fang were forced to resign, or if he came to an untimely end, then my report would cease to be an issue. </string>
  <string id="67101">Okay, I&apos;ll get rid of Fang.</string>
  <string id="67103">That&apos;s too complicated. I&apos;ll just kill you.</string>
  <string id="67104">I guess I have to kill you, then.</string>
  <string id="67105">You just annoy me. Time to die!</string>
  <string id="67106">I&apos;ll be going now.</string>
  <string id="67109">Congratulations, Sheng. You&apos;ve earned it.</string>
  <string id="67111">You&apos;re nothing but a puppet for the Lotus Assassins.</string>
  <string id="67158">Maybe it will be you.</string>
  <string id="67159">You sure have a lot of enemies.</string>
  <string id="67164">I&apos;m still working on it.</string>
  <string id="67167">I&apos;ve decided to kill you instead.</string>
  <string id="67168">Old Masters</string>
  <string id="67171">You will fall now.</string>
  <string id="67174">Honor gift?</string>
  <string id="67208" soundid="92145">Ya Zhen: Hrm... wise, I suppose. You will have a powerful ally when all is done.</string>
  <string id="67209" soundid="92146">I do not think the mind of a mortal was meant to hold such ability.</string>
  <string id="67210" soundid="92147">With this power, you would never suffer the will of another tyrant.</string>
  <string id="67211" soundid="92148">This is where it begins. A question of similar intent was the start of all our grief.</string>
  <string id="67212" soundid="92149">Chai Ka: Be careful. You tread a dangerous path.</string>
  <string id="67213" soundid="92150">Ya Zhen: Your thoughts are leading in an interesting direction, mortal.</string>
  <string id="67214" soundid="92151">Well said. This creature merely wants its own lofty place restored.</string>
  <string id="67215" soundid="92152">You must keep the cost clearly in mind. The Empire is in the balance.</string>
  <string id="67216" soundid="92153">Using this power for the good of all would justify any means.</string>
  <string id="67217" soundid="92154">Are you certain that you will remain human after all is done?</string>
  <string id="67218" soundid="92155">The heavens have manipulated us for too long.</string>
  <string id="67219" soundid="92156">I have learned that humanity cannot fully comprehend the cost.</string>
  <string id="67220" soundid="92157">Chai Ka: You must learn to appreciate your place in the order of things.</string>
  <string id="67221" soundid="92158">Ya Zhen: Throw off the yoke the heavens would place on you. I&apos;m curious as to the result.</string>
  <string id="67222" soundid="92159">One you are destined to make. I will stand by you, my love.</string>
  <string id="67223" soundid="92160">And you have earned that right. I am with you.</string>
  <string id="67224" soundid="92161">Power can force a lot of freedom. I am with you.</string>
  <string id="67225" soundid="92162">Do not make me take part in this act! If I could move against you, I would. You must not do this!</string>
  <string id="67226" soundid="92163">I do not want to be a part of this. If I were not bound, I would beg you to stop.</string>
  <string id="67227" soundid="92164">You are a far greater evil than I imagined. My mistake was ever giving my loyalty in the first place.</string>
  <string id="67228" soundid="92165">The horror of this. Please, see the consequences and remember who you are.</string>
  <string id="67229" soundid="92166">Chai Ka: If the decision is yours, so is the task of bringing the blood. Who of your fellows would you sacrifice for your gain? Whose blood will you use?</string>
  <string id="67230" soundid="92167">Enough. If this must be done, let it be done quickly.</string>
  <string id="67231" soundid="92168">No! At least let there be a fight. I can&apos;t simply let you do this.</string>
  <string id="67232" soundid="92169">No! Must I be bound while this happens? I would fight....</string>
  <string id="67233" soundid="92170">I cannot let this stand. I will fight you.</string>
  <string id="67234" soundid="92171">You coward! At least give me the freedom to try and stop this!</string>
  <string id="67235" soundid="92172">My father betrayed the Empire. I won&apos;t let you join him in that madness. I won&apos;t!</string>
  <string id="67236" soundid="92173">This, I really don&apos;t care for. Someone *help!*</string>
  <string id="67237" soundid="92174">My love is right, as always. You will not have the satisfaction you wish. Dissenters must simply be killed.</string>
  <string id="67238" soundid="92175">I will... help as well. It must be done, and we can permit no dissension.</string>
  <string id="67239" soundid="92176">Of course you won&apos;t dirty your hands on such vermin. The concerns of an empire must take priority.</string>
  <string id="67240" soundid="92177">Whatever is your will, Master.</string>
  <string id="67241" soundid="92178">Let me fight for you. There&apos;s so much death here, and none yet by my blades!</string>
  <string id="67242" soundid="92179">Chai Ka: I... I must obey, though this is against all that the Guardian was meant to protect.</string>
  <string id="67243" soundid="92180">Ya Zhen: Yes, let us gather the blood you need. You are above it all.</string>
  <string id="67244" soundid="92181">Please... not like this.</string>
  <string id="67245" soundid="92182">I await your worst.</string>
  <string id="67246" soundid="92183">With my eyes open, for the Empire.</string>
  <string id="67247" soundid="92184"></string>
  <string id="67248" soundid="92185">You see? My love takes personal responsibility. Already he shows more will than the frauds we face.</string>
  <string id="67249" soundid="92186">Yes, show me you have the strength to craft an empire.</string>
  <string id="67250" soundid="92187">I do so love your willingness to get dirty.</string>
  <string id="67251" soundid="92188">This is what you want? Then the friend I knew is well and truly dead at Master Li&apos;s hand.</string>
  <string id="67252" soundid="92189">I have no choice, though I know I will not win. Come.</string>
  <string id="67253" soundid="92190">Face me, then. I will fall for the Empire I once believed in.</string>
  <string id="67254" soundid="92191">If they fight for me, they will benefit from my influence as you have, Spirit Monk.</string>
  <string id="67255" soundid="92192">The heavens guide your hands. Pray it is enough.</string>
  <string id="67256" soundid="92193"></string>
  <string id="67257" soundid="92194">Yes, they will help in your cause even though they were disloyal.</string>
  <string id="67258" soundid="92195">Yes, a use for those that have gone against your will. How better to punish their disloyalty?</string>
  <string id="67259" soundid="92196">I like it. Even though they have been disloyal, they will help in your cause.</string>
  <string id="67260" soundid="92197">As you command, it will be so.</string>
  <string id="67261" soundid="92198">Chai Ka: As you command, though the Guardian hopes you see that this is not right.</string>
  <string id="67262" soundid="92199">Ya Zhen: Yes, bring in the dissenters, the disloyal. They&apos;re good for blood and nothing else.</string>
  <string id="67263" soundid="92200"></string>
  <string id="67264" soundid="92201">Don&apos;t do this. You can&apos;t let the promise of power overwhelm who you are.</string>
  <string id="67265" soundid="92202">You have turned all that I fought for upside down. Do not do this.</string>
  <string id="67266" soundid="92203">Do not do this. I want no part in what you are doing.</string>
  <string id="67267" soundid="92204">I... really do not like this. My blood is very important to me.</string>
  <string id="67268" soundid="92205">I bleed, though I am sustained by other forces. Withdraw that energy if that is your wish. A part of me yearns for it.</string>
  <string id="67269" soundid="92206">A fitting end to this poor creature. Let him be a part of bringing you the power that corrupted him.</string>
  <string id="67270" soundid="92207">I welcome this choice. The mistakes of my family can lead to your victory.</string>
  <string id="67271" soundid="92208">A fitting end. His fall will aid in the defeat of those who made him.</string>
  <string id="67272" soundid="92209">It... it is that simple? You can simply order his death, and he falls? If you risk the Empire, should you not have to risk yourself?</string>
  <string id="67273" soundid="92210">A coward&apos;s choice. There is no risk in this. You would endanger the Empire with a simple command?</string>
  <string id="67274" soundid="92211">You again show the rewards of loyalty to your cause. Does this amuse you, or is he simply the easiest to abuse?</string>
  <string id="67275" soundid="92212">This shell has long been tainted by the misuse of my power. It should be put to rest, not used to further the crime that sustained it!</string>
  <string id="67276" soundid="92213">As you wish.</string>
  <string id="67277" soundid="92214"></string>
  <string id="67278" soundid="92215">Ya Zhen: The blood! Who will be the blood? You need blood to poison the dragon&apos;s corpse. Whose will it be? I want to see!</string>
  <string id="67279" soundid="92216">And you might cease to be human, as well.</string>
  <string id="67280" soundid="92217">And why would you? It is corrupt to the core, anyway.</string>
  <string id="67281" soundid="92218">You would not care? Everything we have done has been for the legacy of the Empire!</string>
  <string id="67282" soundid="92219">I begin to see why you would feel that way. Perhaps there is something better.</string>
  <string id="67283" soundid="92220">Don&apos;t say that. We have fought so hard to restore things to the way they were.</string>
  <string id="67284" soundid="92221">Perhaps it should be abandoned. No good has come of it so far.</string>
  <string id="67285" soundid="92222">To cast aside everything... that was our mistake as well.</string>
  <string id="67286" soundid="92223">Chai Ka: You court the end of a great era. Step carefully.</string>
  <string id="67287" soundid="92224">Ya Zhen: Interesting. Walls always crumble eventually; why not at your will?</string>
  <string id="67288" soundid="92225">Better than what? Free choice?</string>
  <string id="67289" soundid="92226">You could force improvements. There would be no more tyrants.</string>
  <string id="67290" soundid="92227">Your will alone would decide what those improvements are? What about tradition?</string>
  <string id="67291" soundid="92228">Yes, a firm hand could shape a great empire.</string>
  <string id="67292" soundid="92229">For whom would you make things better? Everyone, or just those who pleased you?</string>
  <string id="67293" soundid="92230">Yes, so much pain could be avoided with a strong hand.</string>
  <string id="67294" soundid="92231">To make things better... that was our wish. We failed.</string>
  <string id="67295" soundid="92232">Chai Ka: A benevolent tyrant is still a tyrant.</string>
  <string id="67296" soundid="92233">Ya Zhen: You could remake things in your image. If that isn&apos;t better, what is?</string>
  <string id="67297" soundid="92234">He planned it all from the start. His betrayal goes back to the very beginning.</string>
  <string id="67298" soundid="92235">A core of evil through them all, but he constructed the path they took.</string>
  <string id="67299" soundid="92236">It was supposed to be a new era, but even I did not know his true intent.</string>
  <string id="67300" soundid="92237">If you see their foolishness, the same mistakes will not be made again.</string>
  <string id="67301" soundid="92238">They pushed their grasp too far. Now that mistake has come back to them.</string>
  <string id="67302" soundid="92239">That is our shame, but the lure of ascendance was too great.</string>
  <string id="67303" soundid="92240">Their concerns were for the Empire alone. Nothing else mattered.</string>
  <string id="67304" soundid="92241">Nothing was solved. The problem was merely pushed onto someone else&apos;s plate.</string>
  <string id="67305" soundid="92242">If such a place exists, it was beyond our concern. Our minds never strayed from within our borders.</string>
  <string id="67306" soundid="92243"></string>
  <string id="67307" soundid="92244"></string>
  <string id="67308" soundid="92245">Soon it will all be yours, and I will stand at your side. An empire like none before.</string>
  <string id="67309" soundid="92246">I don&apos;t know if I will be much help. Emperor Sun Li is apparently stronger than my father was.</string>
  <string id="67310" soundid="92247">I will follow as well as I can, love, but I do not know if I will be much help. I could not stand against the previous Emperor and Master Li is stronger.</string>
  <string id="67311" soundid="92248">I am ready, but I do not know how effective I will be. I did not fare so well against the last Emperor.</string>
  <string id="67312" soundid="92249">I stand ready, but Li has grown stronger than Hai. This may be your fight alone.</string>
  <string id="67313" soundid="92250">Chai Ka: This fight will be decided on your ability alone. Only you could withstand Sun Hai, and Sun Li is stronger.</string>
  <string id="67314" soundid="92251">Ya Zhen: Whatever you say, but I think this will be your fight alone in the end.</string>
  <string id="67315" soundid="92252">Soon we will set things right, and no one will be able to say otherwise. I know this is right. You showed me.</string>
  <string id="67316" soundid="92253">Soon everything will be right again, and no one will be able to tell you otherwise. You will have the strength to enforce freedom.</string>
  <string id="67317" soundid="92254">It is yours now. If your master falls, everything is yours. No one will be able to say otherwise.</string>
  <string id="67318" soundid="92255">Chai Ka: Soon you will bear the power of the Water Dragon. I do not have confidence in your ability to wield it.</string>
  <string id="67319" soundid="92256">Ya Zhen: Soon you will have everything in the palm of your hand. It has been a privilege to witness your ascension.</string>
  <string id="67320" soundid="92257"></string>
  <string id="67321" soundid="92258">I will live to be as old as the Empire itself, and I will never be able to remove that sight from my mind.</string>
  <string id="67322" soundid="92259">I will treasure this moment for as long as I live. To have a hand in such a creature&apos;s destiny... it is an honor.</string>
  <string id="67323" soundid="92260">This was nearly overwhelming. My eyes were not meant to see such things.</string>
  <string id="67324" soundid="92261">You destroyed the beast. We would have called that a waste.</string>
  <string id="67325" soundid="92262">Chai Ka: It was the only choice that would restore balance and order. If nothing ends, there are no more beginnings.</string>
  <string id="67326" soundid="92263">Ya Zhen: This beast... she could have been put to better use. You mortals have odd priorities.</string>
  <string id="67327" soundid="92264">Yes, your Master. He made this possible. I don&apos;t know how much help I will be against him.</string>
  <string id="67328" soundid="92265">Yes, the Glorious Strategist awaits. I do not know if I will be able to aid in the fight against him.</string>
  <string id="67329" soundid="92266">That is true, and I doubt we can do much to help you. You must face your Master yourself. Would we even stand a chance?</string>
  <string id="67330" soundid="92267">We have to try. I can&apos;t leave here knowing I didn&apos;t try.</string>
  <string id="67331" soundid="92268">I am still bound to you, and I ask that you let me fight. Master Li has much to answer for.</string>
  <string id="67332" soundid="92269">We will try. There is nothing else we can do.</string>
  <string id="67333" soundid="92270">I want to help. You still decide my actions. Guide me into this last fight.</string>
  <string id="67334" soundid="92271">Chai Ka: I will be here for this final confrontation, but I do not know how much help I will be.</string>
  <string id="67335" soundid="92272">Ya Zhen: I still stand at your side, but what point is there? Your Master is practically unassailable.</string>
  <string id="67336" soundid="92273">Bah! Throw me at him. He is still flesh, and flesh can be cut.</string>
  <string id="67337" soundid="92274">A foolish hope, but I welcome the sentiment.</string>
  <string id="67338" soundid="92275">I will try. I have to.</string>
  <string id="67339" soundid="92276">If safety were my only concern, I would not be anywhere near here.</string>
  <string id="67340" soundid="92277">Safety has no place in battles that decide empires.</string>
  <string id="67341" soundid="92278">If you believe that, then truly you do not know my love of the Empire.</string>
  <string id="67342" soundid="92279">If that is what you wish, but I would do so even without your command. This is my fate, too, now.</string>
  <string id="67343" soundid="92280">This event will be decided by actions, not orders. Lead us.</string>
  <string id="67344" soundid="92281">As you wish.</string>
  <string id="67345" soundid="92282">If you wish to believe that, so be it. As long as I get to fight.</string>
  <string id="67346" soundid="92283">Such a helpless feeling to know that the fate of the Empire will be decided tonight and that I can do nothing.</string>
  <string id="67347" soundid="92284">There is little we can do. You are the one who led us here.</string>
  <string id="67348" soundid="92285">I feel so useless. Like walking beside a giant.</string>
  <string id="67349" soundid="92286">Bah. What good is such a fight if I cannot take part? If he&apos;s so powerful, there should be plenty to go around!</string>
  <string id="67350" soundid="92287"></string>
  <string id="67351" soundid="92288">Will you force me to fight? I would try even if my will was free, but it may be pointless. Your Master is apparently far stronger than my father was.</string>
  <string id="67352" soundid="92289">There is a great deal left to do. Your Master awaits. I do not know what help anyone else will be in this coming battle.</string>
  <string id="67353" soundid="197613"></string>
  <string id="67357">There&apos;s no time for this. Find your way as best you can.</string>
  <string id="67359">Very well. Everyone meet near the throne room.</string>
  <string id="67362">He has been destroyed.</string>
  <string id="67364">I put him to rest.</string>
  <string id="67365">I&apos;ll see what I can do.</string>
  <string id="67368" soundid="149895">It is yours. I no longer need such worthless baubles. My only joy now will be in the suffering I can cause her spirit.</string>
  <string id="67369" soundid="150713">Ha! The Scourge of the South... I wonder how many people I&apos;d have to steal from to get a name like that? With that description, they&apos;ll never find you.</string>
  <string id="67370" soundid="149897">What? *That* was her excuse? Impossible! Stupid! I don&apos;t believe it!</string>
  <string id="67438">I am sorry, but it is necessary. Hold her.</string>
  <string id="67439" soundid="196527">When you have a moment, we should talk.</string>
  <string id="67442">I am sorry, but it is necessary. Hold her.</string>
  <string id="67448">I have a demon, the Black Whirlwind, and Death&apos;s Hand. They will ensure my will is obeyed!</string>
  <string id="67449">I have heard enough! I will kill any dissenters with my own hands!</string>
  <string id="67458" soundid="166110">You should probably go down to his camp and check with Lord Yun; he&apos;ll likely want to reward you.</string>
  <string id="67459">I am sorry, but it is necessary. Hold him.</string>
  <string id="67460">Have Kang bring forth Dawn Star.</string>
  <string id="67472">Silk Fox will serve.</string>
  <string id="67473">Have Kang bring forth Silk Fox.</string>
  <string id="67474">Sky will provide the blood.</string>
  <string id="67475">Have Sky brought forth.</string>
  <string id="67476">Hou would be amusing.</string>
  <string id="67477">Have Kang bring forth Ho. He would be amusing.</string>
  <string id="67478">Death&apos;s Hand, do you have enough blood left in that corpse you call a body?</string>
  <string id="67486">I have heard enough! I will kill any dissenters with my own hands!</string>
  <string id="67487">I have a demon, the Black Whirlwind, and Death&apos;s Hand. They will ensure my will is obeyed!</string>
  <string id="67488">There is no one to object. Death&apos;s Hand dies, and your power will be mine.</string>
  <string id="67491">If I had your power, I wouldn&apos;t care about the Empire.</string>
  <string id="67499">With your power, I could make things better.</string>
  <string id="67509">No one else will question my will. Master Li will fall!</string>
  <string id="67510">Silence! Be ready for the coming fight!</string>
  <string id="67522">The greater abomination is yet to come.</string>
  <string id="67525">Quiet. We are not done here.</string>
  <string id="67533">I welcome your help, if you can do so safely.</string>
  <string id="67535" soundid="196530"></string>
  <string id="67536" soundid="196531"></string>
  <string id="67538">You will help because I order it.</string>
  <string id="67540" soundid="196532"></string>
  <string id="67544">I have to do this alone.</string>
  <string id="67545" soundid="196533"></string>
  <string id="67549">Do what you must, but stay out of my way.</string>
  <string id="67602" soundid="92550">No great waves of energy, no demons from the walls. Skill versus skill. Master versus student, as you said.</string>
  <string id="67603" soundid="92551">I expect you have corrected the flaw in your style? No matter. Beyond the basics, I also taught you... focus. Match me if you can.</string>
  <string id="67604" soundid="92552">I meant for you to reach a certain plateau and then wait to be knocked off. I tried as much with my brother. I will succeed again with you.</string>

  <string id="70946">Horse Demons

Words are only wasted describing these equine horrors, for their appearances are all too easily recalled from the nightmares of childhood. All the legends talk of these beasts&apos; fiery manes and terrifying strength, but few sources delve beyond the lore to seek out the fact. It was a most fortunate happenstance that led this author into a roadside discussion with the venerable Li Shi Tun, a master warrior who had recently destroyed one of these beasts. His insight proved most valuable, for it was this master who first made clear the true effect of the horse demon&apos;s terrifying mane. Holding out blistered hands, the ancient warrior made his point most clearly: to strike a creature who controls elemental fires with such ease is to strike the flame itself. One must be prepared to hurt themselves with each attack.</string>

This blade is claimed by two legends, one from the Prosperous East and one from the Golden Delta. In the first, a flower girl was wronged by an official, and an outlaw incited revenge for his own purposes. Trapping the official, the woman beat him savagely with a bouquet of roses, the thorns raking eyes and skin. An observing fox spirit frowned on hatred abusing such beauty, and transformed the flowers into a sword. The official was killed, leaving the woman to ponder the hardening of her heart. In the second tale, the outlaw instead urged restraint and suggested asking the river for guidance. A golden carp answered the woman&apos;s plea and, as it swam by, the sun on its scales took the shape of a blade that fell in the shallows at her feet. She took up arms in the spirit of justice and order was restored. Stories--and people--change with the influence that others bring.</string>
  <string id="70951">Weapon Style, Artifact Weapon
+25% Damage Over Basic Long Sword Style

The story of the Broken Bough is a sad page in the history of the Jade Empire. When Emperor Zuwan, ninth emperor in the time of divisions, died suddenly with no heir, his wife, Seng Si, assumed the throne to prevent chaos. Though respected, she was seen as merely a ceremonial caretaker. When war erupted a decade later the Imperial Army would not follow her orders, so she took up a sword and asked instead that they follow her lead. Emperors lead armies only in legends; Seng Si&apos;s commitment stunned her detractors, and her death shamed the nation. Seng Si the Broken Bough changed the face of the Imperial court, though the relics of her rule were never displayed.</string>

Maker&apos;s Bane was forged from a falling star that tore from the heavens as the Celestial Dragon shaped the world. The loss of life resulting from its use is thoroughly predictable.

Placid Guiju is a sepulcher for the God of Agricultural Poetry. Guiju of Words and Land transformed into a plowshare to aid the workers of the Golden Delta, but was trapped when the farmers remade their tools into weapons to repel invading Horselords. Pounding plowshare to sword might have held ironic appeal, but being an axe causes injury to Guiju&apos;s poetic sensibilities. The effectiveness of this blade is agony for his gentle spirit, an insult that will eventually destroy him and strip &quot;field verse&quot; from the Lexicon of the Ages. It also makes the wielder slightly giddy.</string>

  <string id="71530" soundid="96868">I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll find a way to bounce back.</string>
  <string id="71531" soundid="96869">I can&apos;t wait for the next fight to start.</string>
  <string id="71532" soundid="96870">I hear Qui the Promoter&apos;s got some new types of fights lined up.</string>
  <string id="71533" soundid="96871">The Emperor used to attend these matches, but he stopped coming years ago.</string>
  <string id="71534" soundid="96872">I follow all the fighters&apos; careers.</string>
  <string id="71535" soundid="96873">I should go home, but I really want to watch the next fight.</string>
  <string id="71536" soundid="96874">You&apos;re going to tear through the qualifiers. I can just tell.</string>
  <string id="71537" soundid="96875">You will go far in the Bronze Division. I look forward to seeing you face Crimson Khana.</string>
  <string id="71538" soundid="96876">You were a sure thing in my eyes.</string>
  <string id="71539" soundid="96877">Khana collapsing was just further proof of how weak she was.</string>
  <string id="71542" soundid="104917">I don&apos;t think we will be referring to you as a &quot;student&quot; much longer. You dealt with those bandits easily enough.</string>
  <string id="71547" soundid="96885">&quot;Khana&apos;s unbeaten streak ends now,&quot; I told myself.</string>
  <string id="71550" soundid="96888">Soldier will be getting nervous at the pace you&apos;re advancing.</string>
  <string id="71551" soundid="96889">I knew Soldier was losing his edge! He couldn&apos;t stay Silver Division champion forever.</string>
  <string id="71552" soundid="96890">You&apos;re going to do very well in the Gold Round, I can feel it.</string>
  <string id="71553" soundid="96891">The Imperial Engagement merely cemented in my mind that you will be our new champion.</string>
  <string id="71554" soundid="96892">Honor is yours, champion. I knew it would be, in time.</string>
  <string id="71555" soundid="96893">Your last match looked painful.</string>
  <string id="71556" soundid="96894">An ogre is no mean foe. Don&apos;t underestimate him and you&apos;ll be fine.</string>
  <string id="71557" soundid="96895">Even in the lower divisions, victory is never a sure thing.</string>
  <string id="71558" soundid="96896">The Bronze Division fights are more difficult than the highest levels of most tournaments.</string>
  <string id="71559" soundid="96897">You need to keep your wits about you to fight in the Silver Division, there&apos;s no denying it.</string>
  <string id="71573" soundid="96911">That last one was a win for you, was it?</string>
  <string id="71574" soundid="96912">I could have sworn the ogre was due for a win. Oh well, there&apos;s more silver into Lucky Cho&apos;s pocket.</string>
  <string id="71575" soundid="96913">Ha! See, I *was* right! You didn&apos;t win. I&apos;ll never doubt the system again.</string>
  <string id="71576" soundid="96914">I could have bought a nice farm in the south if I&apos;d played my cards right.</string>
  <string id="71577" soundid="96915">I can feel it. Today&apos;s going to be my lucky day.</string>
  <string id="71578" soundid="96916">Okay, I can do this. I can pick a winner, I know it!</string>
  <string id="71579" soundid="96917">Surely someone around here will front me a few silvers, just to break this cold streak.</string>
  <string id="71580" soundid="96918">Since my wife left me, I&apos;ve had a lot more time to track the trends in the ring.</string>
  <string id="71581" soundid="96919">You wouldn&apos;t have any hot tips for me, would you? No, no one ever does.</string>
  <string id="71582" soundid="96920">Most new qualifiers don&apos;t progress like you. You&apos;re not making me any money here.</string>
  <string id="71583" soundid="96921">Could you try to be less... good? My bets will bankrupt me again if you keep this up!</string>
  <string id="71584" soundid="96922">I thought Khana was a sure thing.</string>
  <string id="71585" soundid="96923">Then she keels over and dies. Just my luck! I had thirty of my cousin&apos;s silvers on her too!</string>
  <string id="71590" soundid="99443">Since you moved past the Silver Division, things have been too hectic for us to keep an eye on anything. Soldier&apos;s less concerned with the arena&apos;s politics these days anyway.</string>
  <string id="71591" soundid="99444">I keep an eye on the new blood, and I like to see what the Guild&apos;s up to. Kai Lan the Serpent&apos;s men are all agitated since Lucky Cho&apos;s death.</string>
  <string id="71592" soundid="99445">New fighters, like yourself. I also try to keep tabs on what Kai Lan the Serpent and his goon Lucky Cho are up to.</string>
  <string id="71593" soundid="96931">Just my luck that she&apos;d lose! I had thirty of my cousin&apos;s silvers on her too!</string>
  <string id="71594" soundid="99446">Kai Lan&apos;s the real power behind this place. He&apos;s affiliated with the Guild, a criminal organization. I don&apos;t know much about them besides that.</string>
  <string id="71595" soundid="99447">If the larger organization&apos;s anything like the Serpent&apos;s, they&apos;re power hungry maniacs. Kai Lan flaunts his power and corruption. He&apos;s not a man you want to cross.</string>
  <string id="71596" soundid="96934">You can&apos;t possibly keep doing this well for long. Soon, all my bets against you will pay off!</string>
  <string id="71597" soundid="96935">Why do you insist on ruining me? How much silver must I pour upon your opponents before one of them wins at the right time?</string>
  <string id="71598" soundid="96936">Lost a lot on that one. Luckily some large, well dressed fellows were willing to lend me some more silver. That reminds me! I should look up that &quot;dismemberment&quot; word they used....</string>
  <string id="71599" soundid="96937">I had a lot of money riding on you. Well, more on everyone else, but you were key to me finally making a profit!</string>
  <string id="71600" soundid="96938">Bah! I should just stop betting. Care to wager 5 silvers that I can&apos;t last a day? </string>
  <string id="71601" soundid="96939">Why didn&apos;t I bet for your last match?</string>
  <string id="71602" soundid="96940">I&apos;ll just bide my time. Plenty of chances to collect on what I sense will be a grand losing streak!</string>
  <string id="71603" soundid="96941">That&apos;s okay, I&apos;ll put twice as much on the rematch. It&apos;s a sure thing that you&apos;ll lose!</string>
  <string id="71604" soundid="96942">I could have sworn you were due for a win, and my system says wagering for you is a fool&apos;s gambit.</string>
  <string id="71605" soundid="96943">I should have known you weren&apos;t going to win that last one. Stupid of me, so stupid!</string>
  <string id="71609" soundid="99449">People talk to Lucky Cho if they want to bet big on one of the fights. He won&apos;t take silver from you if you&apos;re a fighter or he doesn&apos;t know you very well, however.</string>
  <string id="71610" soundid="99450">Cho collects on his bets the hardest way possible. It&apos;s a bad idea to cross him. Feel free to test his patience if you don&apos;t believe me.</string>
  <string id="71611" soundid="99451">What do you want to talk about?</string>
  <string id="71612" soundid="99452">I help him any way he needs me to. I&apos;m even starting to learn some of his styles, though I&apos;m a long way from his skill. Not many can match him.</string>
  <string id="71613" soundid="99453">Let&apos;s say that my treatment methods are more unorthodox than Doctor An&apos;s, but no less effective.</string>
  <string id="71614" soundid="99454">They&apos;re much more enjoyable as well. You&apos;ll never find out, though. I don&apos;t waste my time on young men. You&apos;re all too... excitable.</string>

  <string id="72016" soundid="97634">Someone told me ghosts aren&apos;t real. Then he died in his sleep. Weird, huh?</string>
  <string id="72017" soundid="97635">How come the grown-ups stop talking when I come into a room?</string>
  <string id="72018" soundid="97636">Ghosts stay away from big groups. I have nine brothers and sisters, so I&apos;m pretty safe.</string>
  <string id="72019" soundid="97637">Nothing fun ever happens in this town! When I grow up, I&apos;m going to leave.</string>
  <string id="72020" soundid="128685">Look, more bandits creeping into the camp! Get them!</string>
  <string id="72023" soundid="128644">You humans never cease to amaze me. It pleases me to no end that you escaped those caves safely.</string>
  <string id="72024" soundid="128645">Ha! I&apos;d have traded your life for the death of that thing as well. It&apos;s a fair trade.</string>
  <string id="72025" soundid="128646">She would have to be! That hill collapsed like a bad cake!</string>
  <string id="72026" soundid="128647">Perhaps we should try to not antagonize the fox with the burning halo of fire, hmm?</string>
  <string id="72027" soundid="128648">My ancient enemy is dead. In their burrowing, her followers riddled the hill with enough passageways that the whole system collapsed.</string>
  <string id="72028" soundid="128649">I had not thought to drop a mountain on my ancient foe, but your kind is always so resourceful.</string>
  <string id="72029" soundid="128650">With the Mother gone, the forest will recover. I have already spoken to Lord Yun, and he is aware of what you have done for me.</string>
  <string id="72030" soundid="128651">I&apos;m gonna miss those little bastards. They tried so hard, and they just kept coming... one after another, practically throwing themselves on my axes.</string>
  <string id="72031" soundid="128652">You have to respect that kind of mindless dedication. Ah well. Let&apos;s go find something else to cleave.</string>
  <string id="72032" soundid="128653">There you are! The Guardian and I had to run back up through the Inn. It&apos;s really quiet there, so I think the monsters are all gone.</string>
  <string id="72034" soundid="128655">You&apos;re safe! Thank the heavens. When the earth started to shake I was cut off from you. The inn&apos;s pretty quiet. I think we... you stopped them.</string>
  <string id="72035" soundid="128656">All I know is that I&apos;ll never look at meat the same way again.</string>
  <string id="72040">Chumin is just a little shy.</string>
  <string id="72042">And he has a thriving business!</string>
  <string id="72044">He&apos;s a true artist.</string>
  <string id="72045" soundid="128657">Well. That was exciting. The cavern started collapsing and I couldn&apos;t get back to you.</string>
  <string id="72046" soundid="128658">You survived? Somehow I&apos;m not surprised. I was forced to dodge rocks all the way back to the Inn. I think the beasts have been wiped out.</string>
  <string id="72049" soundid="169823">Why don&apos;t we stop and talk a moment?</string>
  <string id="72051" soundid="128662">I hope, for us all, that you can learn the fate of the Water Dragon. Until she returns to her home, things will only get worse. </string>
  <string id="72052">I would have given my life to see that abomination dead.</string>
  <string id="72054">Are you sure she&apos;s gone?</string>
  <string id="72056">That would have been much easier with your help!</string>
  <string id="72059">Will the forest recover?</string>
  <string id="72060">Could you at least tell Lord Yun what I&apos;ve done?</string>
  <string id="72063">Too bad he&apos;s going bankrupt.</string>
  <string id="72064">[Charm] I&apos;m willing to bet Ai Ling could help you on that front.</string>
  <string id="72065">[Intuition] You two both seemed to already know a lot about each other. I think you wanted me to introduce you.</string>
  <string id="72070">You won&apos;t beat me!</string>
  <string id="72077" soundid="97696">Hello again, citizen. Something else you need?</string>
  <string id="72078" soundid="97697">Do your best. You&apos;ll need it.</string>
  <string id="72082" soundid="97701">I have been awarded the singular honor of retirement. Some say a soldier has failed in his duty if he sees his term end peacefully.</string>
  <string id="72083" soundid="97702">Between you and me, those people should be immediately promoted to the front line if they&apos;re so quick to throw away lives in the name of duty.</string>
  <string id="72084">That doesn&apos;t work...</string>
  <string id="72085">You will feel pain!</string>
  <string id="72086">Your last breath!</string>
  <string id="72087" soundid="97706">A few questions? Are you sure you don&apos;t have just one thing to ask me? I suppose we&apos;re coming to that soon enough.</string>
  <string id="72088" soundid="97707">If it&apos;s all the same to you, I&apos;d rather just be left to my thoughts.</string>
  <string id="72089" soundid="97708">So soon? A butterfly whispered in my ear that you and I were going to have a little discussion. Ah well, in your own time, Bronze Champion.</string>
  <string id="72090" soundid="97709">Of course. Always a pleasure to speak to the rank and file.</string>
  <string id="72091" soundid="97710">Hold, that&apos;s enough.</string>
  <string id="72092" soundid="97711">Well done!</string>
  <string id="72093" soundid="97712">You&apos;ve certainly earned your name, Raging Dragon. Not many can face General Stone Kao and stand the victor!</string>
  <string id="72094" soundid="97713">Word will spread among the men that their general was beaten by the Silver Phoenix. Well done!</string>
  <string id="72095" soundid="97714">I should have known better than to contend with Tiger Lifts the Mountain, but who could resist the chance?</string>
  <string id="72097" soundid="97716">Still got a few tricks up my sleeve. I bet you&apos;re glad you didn&apos;t face me for real.</string>
  <string id="72098" soundid="97717">I taught Iron Soldier everything he knows, and he didn&apos;t pay attention to half, so you should be just fine in your next match.</string>
  <string id="72100" soundid="97719">I was wondering when we&apos;d come to the point. You&apos;re up to face Iron Soldier next, aren&apos;t you? He&apos;s tried this little trick before.</string>
  <string id="72101" soundid="97720">I accept your challenge, and I will even educate you as to why, just as I did for the two lads who previously stood where you are now.</string>
  <string id="72102" soundid="97721">Would you in his place?</string>
  <string id="72103" soundid="97722">One of them went on to greater things. The other.... well, I hope he found peace in the water as I do.</string>
  <string id="72104" soundid="97723">I&apos;m sure Soldier told you he was dishonorably discharged, and he blames me for that. I am to blame, so that&apos;s fair.</string>
  <string id="72105" soundid="97724">He forgets that, without my intervention, he would have been beheaded on the spot. I wouldn&apos;t have stepped in had I known it would condemn him to a life of bitter rage.</string>
  <string id="72107" soundid="97726">Iron Soldier, a brash youth far under my command at the time, struck a Lotus Assassin in the face.</string>
  <string id="72108" soundid="97727">He disagreed with orders to slaughter a small northern village. Its citizens were unjustly accused of harboring criminals who were plotting to murder the Emperor.</string>
  <string id="72109" soundid="97728">The Assassin demanded Soldier&apos;s head, and I refused. What Soldier did was wrong; why he did it was not.</string>
  <string id="72110" soundid="97729">General Stone Kao pleads for nothing. If you are my end, I meet you as an honorable opponent.</string>
  <string id="72111" soundid="97730">Things have grown worse with the Imperial Army. The Lotus Assassins control everything now. I was the last to oppose them, and I am lucky to be retired instead of dead.</string>
  <string id="72112" soundid="97731">Perhaps you will achieve their ends for them. Or perhaps not.</string>
  <string id="72113" soundid="97732">Either way, my tale is done and this blade, a retirement gift, demands some attention. Do you stand ready?</string>
  <string id="72114" soundid="97733">I see. Then you rescind your challenge?</string>
  <string id="72115" soundid="97734">He told you the whole story as he sees it. His vision has narrowed considerably.</string>
  <string id="72116" soundid="97735">Time will have to do her job alone, it seems.</string>
  <string id="72117" soundid="97736">Tell me, if you&apos;ve changed your mind, would you be up for a friendly match? Not to the death, just until one of us falls over wheezing?</string>
  <string id="72118" soundid="97737">Really? This is a treat. Not everyone gets to face one of the arena&apos;s champions! Let&apos;s see if I can still remember a few of the old forms.</string>
  <string id="72119" soundid="97738">A shame. There was no harm in asking. Go back to Soldier and face him honorably. He&apos;ll learn his lesson eventually.</string>
  <string id="72120" soundid="97739">I greet you as well.</string>
  <string id="72121" soundid="97740">I have no family left, cur. They were in the village that Soldier tried to save. They burned under the assassins&apos; orders.</string>
  <string id="72122" soundid="97741">A soldier does what he must.</string>
  <string id="72123" soundid="97742">So be it! Let all know that I freely accepted this fight, and that, on my honor, there will be no repercussions!</string>
  <string id="72124">General Stone Kao, I challenge you to a duel to the death.</string>
  <string id="72127">Your family will thank me for silencing your inane stories.</string>
  <string id="72130">Enough! Fight or surrender, old man.</string>
  <string id="72131">Spare me the stories, old man.</string>
  <string id="72133">What are you doing here?</string>
  <string id="72138">What do you know about Judge Fang?</string>
  <string id="72139">No one gets away!</string>
  <string id="72140">Fight dirty!</string>
  <string id="72141">Do you have time to answer a few questions for me?</string>
  <string id="72142">I should go.</string>
  <string id="72148">Door</string>
  <string id="72151">What happened to the other two?</string>
  <string id="72152">Soldier didn&apos;t mention that there were two others.</string>
  <string id="72156">What was his crime?</string>
  <string id="72157">It sounds like you denied him an honorable death.</string>
  <string id="72161">Why did you spare him from the assassins?</string>
  <string id="72162">Now you plead for your life with this little story?</string>
  <string id="72166">I won&apos;t fight you.</string>
  <string id="72167">Soldier didn&apos;t tell me the whole story.</string>
  <string id="72169">I want no part of your death.</string>
  <string id="72171">It would be an honor, General.</string>
  <string id="72173">I don&apos;t really have the time.</string>
  <string id="72174">I greet you as my honored opponent.</string>
  <string id="72175">Please press your Fight Style keys to map this style to the chosen direction. </string>
  <string id="72178">Take me to the men who are hiding first. They&apos;re in for a surprise.</string>
  <string id="72180" soundid="136227">We can&apos;t let the Inscrutable Power Source fall into enemy hands! You hold her off!</string>
  <string id="72181">Talk to Sheng</string>
  <string id="72184">Return to Tien&apos;s Landing and tell Minister Sheng that the dam is closed.</string>
  <string id="72204">I have my own silver. You are not above personal sales, are you?</string>
  <string id="72240" soundid="136294">Passing through? So you intend to head north? I&apos;m sorry to say, but that simply won&apos;t work.</string>
  <string id="72241" soundid="136295">Besides, I think I have some old family business to catch up on. Old alliances to re-forge, as it were.</string>
  <string id="72242" soundid="136296">I&apos;ve been in this forest long enough that it was very clear when she died. The air...changed. There&apos;s really no other way to describe it.</string>
  <string id="72243" soundid="136297">I&apos;m sure you made the right decision and did what needed to be done. I know the trees won&apos;t heal for some time, but that&apos;s to be expected.</string>
  <string id="72244" soundid="136298">As I said, the Forest Shadow herself informed me of your brave actions.</string>
  <string id="72245" soundid="136299">It was a lucky moment when you walked into this place. Fortunate for us both, in fact.</string>
  <string id="72246" soundid="136300">Indeed, it is. You have my deepest gratitude. I had virtually given up hope, and you appeared like a gift from the heavens.</string>
  <string id="72247" soundid="136301">Farewell. That map will carry you safely if you can find a flyer with the range. I wish you all the best of luck.</string>
  <string id="72249">How did you know I cured your forest?</string>
  <string id="72252">I think it&apos;s time I left.</string>
  <string id="72254">No particular reason. I&apos;m simply passing through.</string>
  <string id="72256">Just tell me what you need me to do.</string>
  <string id="72260">There is a problem with a data file. You may need to reinstall the game. Press OK to continue.</string>
  <string id="72262">Several flyers are heading for Two Rivers, and it is unlikely their presence is a coincidence. You must get back to town as quickly as you can.</string>
  <string id="72263" soundid="136317">I am so very sorry. You must accept my apologies; he is uncontrollable sometimes.</string>
  <string id="72264" soundid="136318">Keep your apologies! That was amazing! Spear Catches Leaf is no warrior. He doesn&apos;t understand the thrill of victory!</string>
  <string id="72266" soundid="136320">Disturbing. It truly is.</string>
  <string id="72267" soundid="136321">It&apos;s an unnatural blackness that develops on their bark. I noticed it some months ago and it spread like wildfire. It is like nothing I have ever seen before.</string>
  <string id="72269">TUTORIAL</string>
  <string id="72270" soundid="136324">Yes, and why so many? Why here? Rare souls occasionally wander from the path to the underworld but the forest is full of them. Perhaps it&apos;s tied to the Forest Shadow.</string>
  <string id="72272">I already know him. Let&apos;s talk about what you can do for me.</string>
  <string id="72273">Exit to City</string>
  <string id="72274">I&apos;ve already talked to him, thanks. I should be going.</string>
  <string id="72277" soundid="136331">Odd. Could the missing crystal be tied to her aggression? Perhaps if we can reach her, we can find the answers.</string>
  <string id="72278" soundid="136332">You were there to witness it and yet survived. This is very strange indeed. If we can reach her, we can find some answers, though we will have to be careful.</string>
  <string id="72280" soundid="136334">You&apos;ve just had the... unexpected honor of defeating the Black Whirlwind, the self-styled deadliest mercenary in the Jade Empire.</string>
  <string id="72281" soundid="136335">I thought you were a ghost. Wasn&apos;t that clear? Ha! And people say I&apos;m slow.</string>
  <string id="72282" soundid="136336">Does she look at all like she&apos;s dead? No! No mask, not floating, clearly not a ghost. You simply wanted a challenge. You are an idiot. A deadly, drunken idiot.</string>
  <string id="72283" soundid="136337">Does this look anything like a ghost? Is he floating, or missing parts, or anything along those lines? No. You are an idiot. A deadly, drunken idiot.</string>
  <string id="72284" soundid="136338">What&apos;s wrong with being deadly... or drunk? You may be a lead hunter for some lord, but I&apos;m the deadliest mercenary in the world. You do your job, and I&apos;ll do mine.</string>
  <string id="72285" soundid="136339">There&apos;s dozens of them, but if you didn&apos;t recognize me right away, you must not have heard them.</string>
  <string id="72286" soundid="136340">Now really isn&apos;t the time to share them. I&apos;d need about five bowls of wine and a soft patch of ground to even get started.</string>
  <string id="72287" soundid="189541"></string>
  <string id="72290" soundid="136344">She is an ancient fox spirit who has always stood guardian over these woods. But now ghosts gather, the trees grow sick, and she seems powerless to stop any of it.</string>
  <string id="72293" soundid="136347">I still find the news of her attack disturbing. I can see why you&apos;d be leery of her, but I can&apos;t help but think there&apos;s another reason.</string>
  <string id="72294" soundid="136348">An attack? That&apos;s... that&apos;s not right. She&apos;s never been known to attack anyone. I&apos;ve hunted this forest on my Lord&apos;s behalf for a decade and had no trouble.</string>
  <string id="72297">Would one of you please explain why I was attacked?</string>
  <string id="72301">What earns a mercenary a title like &quot;deadliest?&quot;</string>
  <string id="72302">Are there any stories of your exploits I would know?</string>
  <string id="72305">Forget about the attack. If you&apos;re Spear Catches Leaf, we need to talk.</string>
  <string id="72308">Let&apos;s talk about the Forest Shadow.</string>
  <string id="72311">Why would the Forest Shadow attack me?</string>
  <string id="72312">Tell me more about the disease affecting the trees.</string>
  <string id="72314">&lt;CUSTOM0&gt; XP</string>
  <string id="72315">Why are the ghosts gathering here?</string>
  <string id="72318">That&apos;s enough about the Forest Shadow.</string>
  <string id="72319">Tell me more about this ritual.</string>
  <string id="72320">I need your Lord&apos;s wind map. Let&apos;s figure out what needs to be done.</string>
  <string id="72323">The man was attacked and killed by the Forest Shadow.</string>
  <string id="72334">Yifong&apos;s daughter, Fuyao has been captured by pirates. She is powerless to deal with these brutal men. Find Fuyao and rescue her from the pirates.</string>
  <string id="72335">Yifong and Fuyao</string>

  <string id="72466" soundid="136687"></string>
  <string id="72489">Two Rivers School</string>
  <string id="72494" soundid="136724">The crystal is yours, but remember our deal.</string>
  <string id="72495">Master Li turned on you in your moment of triumph. You awake in a strange spirit world, no longer among the living. The Water Dragon is calling, drawing you in the direction of a beacon of light. Hopefully she can explain your present condition.</string>
  <string id="72496" soundid="136726">She spoke of your... encounter. She regrets attacking you and considers it a mistake.</string>
  <string id="72497" soundid="136727">She said you would seek to confront her. Go to the upper islands and do so, but know that not all in the forest is as it seems.</string>
  <string id="72498" soundid="136728">I will say no more. Your answers wait with the Forest Shadow.</string>
  <string id="72499">Why did your mistress attack me?</string>
  <string id="72501">What do you mean by that cryptic statement?</string>
  <string id="72503">Stunning Kick</string>
  <string id="72515">You blocked my attack!</string>
  <string id="72516" soundid="136763">That&apos;s...almost too incredible to believe, but then, so is the rapid disease and the number of ghosts here.</string>
  <string id="72517" soundid="136764">I can accept that. I can also appreciate what you have gone through. I have a feeling this forest was beyond my abilities to cure.</string>
  <string id="72518" soundid="136765">It seems a shame. Yet, looking around this place, I would have to wonder what kind of people could survive for months surrounded by blight and the dead.</string>
  <string id="72519" soundid="136766">I shall trust that you did what had to be done. The air certainly seems fresher since you&apos;ve returned. Perhaps this forest will heal after all.</string>
  <string id="72520" soundid="136767">They&apos;re all right, then? I wouldn&apos;t have expected that after being isolated here for so long.</string>
  <string id="72521" soundid="136768">Caves? Oh, yes I remember that there was a tiny storage cavern below the inn. I suppose there could be still more.</string>
  <string id="72522" soundid="136769">We may very well do that, and soon. Yes, we should take them supplies and food and see if there&apos;s anything else we can do to help them.</string>
  <string id="72523" soundid="136770">True enough. The forest is cured, it seems. If they&apos;ve survived this long, things will only get easier for them.</string>
  <string id="72524" soundid="136771">True. I should focus on more important matters. There will be some work ahead of me.</string>
  <string id="72525" soundid="136772">It doesn&apos;t really matter. I shall deal with the inn in time and see for myself.</string>
  <string id="72526" soundid="136773">One thing I have been meaning to ask you, though. What of the Pilgrim&apos;s Rest? Spear Catches Leaf mentioned that you went there to retrieve the crystal.</string>
  <string id="72527" soundid="136774">How do they fare in that place?</string>
  <string id="72528" soundid="136775">What? All of them dead? That&apos;s terrible!</string>
  <string id="72529">They&apos;re all dead. Your forest was home to more than the fox spirit.</string>
  <string id="72530">They were cannibals, serving an ancient demon.</string>
  <string id="72532">You don&apos;t need the details. Just accept that it had to be done.</string>
  <string id="72534">They died for the right reason.</string>
  <string id="72537">You should go and see. They&apos;d love to have you.</string>
  <string id="72538">There&apos;s no one left at the inn. They might have retreated to the caves.</string>
  <string id="72539">You should make your way up there.</string>
  <string id="72541">You have other things to worry about. Leave the inn to its own devices.</string>
  <string id="72543">Your forest is cured, that&apos;s all that matters.</string>
  <string id="72545">Looking after your inn wasn&apos;t part of our agreement.</string>
  <string id="72548" soundid="136795">The set of steps on the north side open to a path that curves to a clearing. From that clearing, the inn&apos;s gateway is clearly visible on the far side.</string>
  <string id="72549">How do I get to the inn?</string>
  <string id="72550" soundid="136797">Find Spear Catches Leaf at the temple above and see what he has learned. Your wind map will be waiting when you find a cure.</string>
  <string id="72552" soundid="136799">You have reached her? This is exceptionally good news! Did you have... any problems?</string>
  <string id="72553" soundid="136800">Demonic magic? That seems incredible, but in this setting I have no choice but to believe you.</string>
  <string id="72554" soundid="136801">Good. Though I am not a &quot;believer&quot; in spiritual matters, I think she is our best hope in this matter.</string>
  <string id="72555" soundid="136802">I would say it is *our* business, but I will trust that you know what you are doing.</string>
  <string id="72556" soundid="136803">If she is not the cause of this forest&apos;s corruption, I hope she told you what must be done. Help her in any way you can, and the wind map will be yours.</string>
  <string id="72557">I have talked with the Forest Shadow.</string>
  <string id="72558">There is a demon corrupting your forest.</string>
  <string id="72560">I have agreed to help her.</string>
  <string id="72562">That is my business.</string>
  <string id="72568" soundid="136817">The ghosts attack everyone! They are mad with...madness! Thank you for keeping me safe.</string>
  <string id="72571" soundid="154557">I am your death, mortal!</string>
  <string id="72577" soundid="143811">That repulsive... I wish I&apos;d known ahead of time. You know, before he hit me.</string>
  <string id="72581" soundid="136843">Will you? Even if you could, I believe you would find it difficult to release so valuable a tool.</string>
  <string id="72582" soundid="136844">Come, then, pit your will against mine. Take him if you can.</string>
  <string id="72583" soundid="186299">Time is better spent doing than talking.</string>
  <string id="72584" soundid="136846">RRRRAAAAAGHHH!</string>
  <string id="72586" soundid="136848">Will you? I wonder why you oppose me when you are so willing to assume my methods.</string>
  <string id="72587" soundid="136849">Enough! You have cut the strings to my puppet, but you will know defeat soon enough. I grow closer to the heavens by the minute.</string>
  <string id="72588" soundid="136850">Take this corpse. See if you can throw away such a useful tool. I will face you at the height of my power, in the heart of *my* Empire.</string>
  <string id="72589" soundid="136851">Your master awaits you, child.</string>
  <string id="72590" soundid="136852"></string>
  <string id="72591" soundid="136853">Please, let me rest. Let my spirit finally have some peace.</string>
  <string id="72592" soundid="136854">Do not step down that low road. This is a mockery of life. Step back from the path my brothers took. That I took.</string>
  <string id="72593" soundid="136855">Know this, Spirit Monk. You walk a path very near that of your Master. Both lead to power, but the cost cannot be avoided!</string>
  <string id="72594" soundid="136856">Know this, Spirit Monk! There are prices to pay!</string>
  <string id="72596" soundid="136858">Your Master is diminished with my loss, even if he does not admit it.</string>
  <string id="72597" soundid="136859">Thank you, Spirit Monk, for letting me rest.</string>
  <string id="72603" soundid="98284">We&apos;ve met before, how could I forget?</string>
  <string id="72604" soundid="98285">We haven&apos;t talked, but I&apos;ve been admiring you from afar ever since your match with Khana.</string>
  <string id="72605" soundid="98286">Here&apos;s the deal. I like you. The way you &quot;dealt&quot; with Khana showed me that you have the will to do what it takes to win. I know a way you and I can both win in this upcoming fight.</string>
  <string id="72606" soundid="98287">A deal, between two people who know how this place *really* works.</string>
  <string id="72607" soundid="98288">No, I&apos;m trying to find a way to benefit from losing it.</string>
  <string id="72608" soundid="98289">No, but you&apos;re too smart to not hear me out.</string>
  <string id="72609" soundid="98290">This is a one-time offer. You listen to it, or you walk away now, and it never comes up again. Sure you want to throw that away so easily?</string>
  <string id="72610" soundid="98291">You know people place bets on the arena fights all the time, right? Things used to go through Lucky Cho. With him dead, the smaller fish are trying to make the big play.</string>
  <string id="72611" soundid="98292">Everyone knows the match between us is coming up. You&apos;re good, but the odds say I&apos;m better. This is our chance, while everything&apos;s in chaos.</string>
  <string id="72612" soundid="98293">I want to place a bet--on you--big enough that I&apos;ll be able to get out of this place whenever I want. If I&apos;m going to lose my title, I deserve that at least.</string>
  <string id="72613" soundid="98294">After what you did to Khana--that arrogant bitch--I can&apos;t think of anyone I&apos;d rather take my place. The Silver champion has to be hard to stay there.</string>
  <string id="72614" soundid="98295">You do me a favor, and I&apos;ll cut you in for twenty five percent of what Li-Li wins when she places the bet for us. During the fight, I take a dive and we both end the day happy and rich.</string>
  <string id="72615" soundid="98296">You&apos;re going to win, and Qui gives you shiny coins when you win. I&apos;m going to lose. This keeps things even.</string>
  <string id="72616" soundid="98297">I&apos;m not open to negotiation on this. That&apos;s a fair number.</string>
  <string id="72617" soundid="98298">Khana was gunning for Silver when you took her out. Ended her smug little unbeaten streak, didn&apos;t you?</string>
  <string id="72618" soundid="98299">Qui&apos;s too weak to do anything about it, and no one else would care except the Serpent. Much of the bet money makes its way into his hands anyway.</string>
  <string id="72619" soundid="98300">From what I hear, you&apos;re not exactly in good with the big man, so I doubt you&apos;d be allowed to see him. Even if you were, I don&apos;t think he&apos;d be inclined to trust you. </string>
  <string id="72620" soundid="98301">I want you to find General Stone Kao. He&apos;s here in the city somewhere.</string>
  <string id="72621" soundid="98302">When you find him, challenge him to a duel to the death. The old fool&apos;s too proud to decline, even though his skills have over the years.</string>
  <string id="72622" soundid="98303">I hear that he was granted a new blade by the higher-ups to commemorate his retirement. I want no piece of the Army, so it&apos;s yours if you defeat him.</string>
  <string id="72623" soundid="98304">I hear word that he&apos;s dead before our match, and I take the dive. It&apos;s that simple.</string>
  <string id="72624" soundid="98305">He&apos;s the one who had me thrown out of the Imperial Army. I&apos;m glad he did now, but he still deserves to pay for the indignity.</string>
  <string id="72625" soundid="98306">I don&apos;t want to talk about it, and it doesn&apos;t matter.</string>
  <string id="72626" soundid="98307">I&apos;m not a pushover like the others. I&apos;d go down fighting, and if you ask me, I won&apos;t be the one clutching myself on the pit floor when all&apos;s said and done.</string>
  <string id="72627" soundid="98308">If you want to take that chance, you can, but I&apos;m offering you a chance to make extra coin and make our match a sure thing.</string>
  <string id="72628" soundid="98309">You don&apos;t have one. Life&apos;s like that. Think about it sensibly, though, and you&apos;ll see that this is my way out, and a chance for me to get rich.</string>
  <string id="72629" soundid="98310">Better still, I get to see my division go to someone I respect and who&apos;s got the guts to protect it like I did, no matter what it takes. That means a lot to me.</string>
  <string id="72630" soundid="98311">No, it&apos;s not. When I hear that General Stone Kao has breathed his last, then it will be a deal. </string>
  <string id="72631" soundid="98312">When you&apos;ve dealt with that old tiger, you come back, talk to me, and I&apos;ll give Qui the go ahead to set up our fight. It&apos;s that easy.</string>
  <string id="72632" soundid="98313">I just wanted to give you a slice of the action; now I&apos;ll have to give you a slice of pain. Go cry to Qui when you&apos;re ready, and I&apos;ll see you in there!</string>
  <string id="72633" soundid="98314">I know why you&apos;re here.</string>
  <string id="72634" soundid="98315">We&apos;re not fighting yet, though. We made a deal. I&apos;ll hear about it if the General loses his duel to you. Now go find him. He&apos;s somewhere out in the city.</string>
  <string id="72650">Sounds interesting. What do you have in mind?</string>
  <string id="72652">You&apos;re just trying to find a way to save your championship.</string>
  <string id="72654">I have no reason to trust you.</string>
  <string id="72656">Don&apos;t even start, Soldier. You&apos;re going down and nothing will change that.</string>
  <string id="72657">Tell me. I&apos;m listening.</string>
  <string id="72660">Why me?</string>
  <string id="72661">How do I benefit from this?</string>
  <string id="72663">Only twenty five percent?</string>
  <string id="72665">Why did you hate Khana so much?</string>
  <string id="72666">What if I told people you were planning to take a dive?</string>
  <string id="72668">I&apos;m still waiting to hear the catch. What&apos;s the favor?</string>
  <string id="72672">Why do you want this general dead?</string>
  <string id="72673">Why were you thrown out?</string>
  <string id="72674">It sounds like it would be easier to just face you normally.</string>
  <string id="72676">What guarantee do I have that you will stick to this?</string>
  <string id="72678">It&apos;s a deal.</string>
  <string id="72680">I&apos;m not interested. See you in the ring.</string>
  <string id="72684" soundid="105709">Should we get started now, or did you need to review how the fight works?</string>
  <string id="72685" soundid="105710">Ask away. It is your right to know what you face.</string>
  <string id="72686">I want to ask a few things about this fight first.</string>
  <string id="72688" soundid="107795">For the surprise! You didn&apos;t know what was coming, and the crowd could sense that. It added drama!</string>
  <string id="72689" soundid="105714">How could you go around spreading rumors when you don&apos;t know what you&apos;re talking about? I promised Ai Ling I&apos;d marry her when we were six years old. *Six!*</string>

  <string id="72788" soundid="104923">You were so brave to fight those bandits. Master Li has trained you well.</string>
  <string id="72789" soundid="104924">Things must be lean out in the swamps if the bandits would dare attack us.</string>
  <string id="72790" soundid="104925">Those bandits didn&apos;t fight nice like you do at the school.</string>
  <string id="72791" soundid="104926">I heard some people died when the bandits attacked. I&apos;m glad you didn&apos;t.</string>
  <string id="72794" soundid="104929">Those bandits were scary, but sometimes Master Li is a little scary too.</string>

  <string id="72809" soundid="156410">The immortal purity of the Water Dragon was befouled by human blood spilled in her fountains. Her power was tainted, allowing the Emperor, a mortal, to seize it as his own.</string>
  <string id="72810" soundid="156411">For a mortal, blood is life. A sacrifice of blood can have great power, even over the gods. But now is not the time for this discussion.</string>

  <string id="72824">What is this, some kind of trick?</string>
  <string id="72826">Why would Master Li betray me?</string>
  <string id="72827">Why did you bring me here?</string>
  <string id="72828">So what am I supposed to do now?</string>
  <string id="72831">I don&apos;t believe any of this. Master Li saved me and raised me as his own!</string>
  <string id="72834">You&apos;re sending me to Dirge? Why me?</string>
  <string id="72836">I still don&apos;t understand what I&apos;m supposed to do!</string>

  <string id="72931" soundid="135116">Many of our order were brought to us as children, orphans we raise to serve our Great Mistress. But a few children are born here at the monastery.</string>
  <string id="72932" soundid="135117">Both your mother and father were Spirit Monks. You were born right here in Dirge and bathed in the sacred fountains, mere days before we were destroyed.</string>
  <string id="72933" soundid="135118">Both your mother and father died in the attack, along with the rest of us who served the Water Dragon.</string>
  <string id="72934" soundid="135119">They were good people. Their love for each other was matched only by their devotion to the Water Dragon herself.</string>
  <string id="72935" soundid="135120">Had they survived, you would have been raised here in Dirge. You would have been instructed from birth in the duties of a Spirit Monk. It is a tragedy you never knew them.</string>
  <string id="72936" soundid="135121">We served the Water Dragon as her guardians and protectors.  We saw to the needs of her physical form, maintained Dirge, and honored her with worship and prayer.</string>
  <string id="72937" soundid="135122">We also served as shepherds for the dead. Most spirits came to Dirge in time, but sometimes a spirit was unable or unwilling to leave the mortal world behind.</string>
  <string id="72938" soundid="135123">We would seek out these lost spirits. Those with unfinished business, or those who had suffered traumatic deaths, would need our help to reach Dirge.</string>
  <string id="72939" soundid="135124">But now that the Water Dragon is gone, none of the spirits can find their way to Dirge. And those already here are trapped; the portal to the afterlife is sealed.</string>
  <string id="72940" soundid="135125">Dirge is a place between. It exists in both the mortal world and the spirit realm, and it leads to the underworld itself. It is a bridge between life and death.</string>
  <string id="72941" soundid="135126">Once it was a holy place, but now it is defiled. Dirge has become a place of great evil and corruption... a corruption that has been growing for the past twenty years.</string>
  <string id="72942" soundid="135127">The Water Dragon is the shepherd of the dead. When people die, their spirits must make the journey from the mortal world to Dirge, where they can pass into the afterlife.</string>
  <string id="72943" soundid="135128">The Water Dragon guides the souls on their journey, leading them here to Dirge... or at least, she did before the Emperor defeated her.</string>
  <string id="72944" soundid="135129">Now the dead have no guide, and Dirge is defiled. The portal to the afterlife is sealed. The dead cannot find peace, and their spirits must wander the mortal world.</string>
  <string id="72945" soundid="135130">With the fountains corrupted, the Water Dragon was vulnerable. The Emperor cut her deeply but did not kill her, keeping her body trapped between life and death.</string>
  <string id="72946" soundid="135131">Her body was taken back to the Imperial City, where it provides an endless supply of water. That was how Sun Hai ended the drought.</string>
  <string id="72947" soundid="135132">If the Water Dragon&apos;s body were destroyed, she might be able to be reborn and reform herself. But while her body survives, her spirit is bound to it.</string>
  <string id="72948" soundid="135133">Emperor Sun Hai seized the Water Dragon&apos;s heart and took her power. When Li killed his brother, he would have devoured the heart in turn.</string>
  <string id="72949" soundid="135134">Destroying her body is part of the process, but that alone will not restore the Water Dragon. Sun Li must also be defeated... or he will become a god himself.</string>
  <string id="72950" soundid="135135">The Water Dragon was the guide and guardian of spirits. She could guide them to the underworld, so perhaps she can guide you back to life.</string>
  <string id="72951" soundid="135136">But with Dirge defiled, she is all but powerless. She will only be able to help you if you restore the fountains and cleanse Dirge.</string>

  <string id="73086" soundid="105013">Eeeh, no, please! I can&apos;t fight. I just didn&apos;t want to be a rock-picker in my grandfather&apos;s field.</string>

  <string id="73089" soundid="105016">My weapons, yes. Um... I don&apos;t know how to use them! I just do this so I don&apos;t have to work the fields.</string>

  <string id="73091" soundid="105018">Quite a bit of excitement. Yes, bandits can be tricky opponents.</string>
  <string id="73092" soundid="105019">They were lucky I had to stay at my post. Yes. Lucky. Master Li wouldn&apos;t like it if I wasn&apos;t here to stop his students leaving.</string>
  <string id="73093" soundid="105020">You... you won&apos;t tell anyone about what happened, will you? I couldn&apos;t leave my post, you know. I can&apos;t keep watch over the students if I&apos;m dead.</string>
  <string id="73094" soundid="105021">Right. And I will. While I&apos;m still alive. What do you need?</string>
  <string id="73095" soundid="105022">Please! It&apos;s not my fault I&apos;m not as skilled as you. This is just the only job I could get that wasn&apos;t... you know... hard.</string>
  <string id="73096" soundid="105023">Couldn&apos;t I convince you to... let the glint of silver distract you? A few coins between friends?</string>
  <string id="73097" soundid="105024">I... I wish I could, but this is all I have. It should be enough to cover this simple little thing.</string>

  <string id="73164">The monk spade evolved from the common shovel to become a weapon feared across the Empire for its ferocity and grace. The spade&apos;s wide, sharpened blade and long staff make it useful for slashing foes at a distance, while the other end&apos;s crescent blade allows deadly follow-up attacks. Very few warriors are even proficient in the monk spade, but a true master of the weapon can easily keep foes at bay with flawless sweeping motions of the spade&apos;s devastating, flashing blade.</string>

  <string id="73345" soundid="158552"></string>
  <string id="73346" soundid="158553">Let&apos;s go get your weapon from Gujin&apos;s workshop. It shouldn&apos;t be too hard to fend off simple bandits. They are foolish to attempt such an attack.</string>
  <string id="73347" soundid="158554">Of course. Good company will make the walk go faster.</string>
  <string id="73348" soundid="158555">Actually, Master Li suggested that I accompany you, just in case you need assistance. He is overly protective, as always.</string>
  <string id="73349" soundid="158556">I know you might prefer to focus on your own thoughts, but I will be nearby should you need me.</string>
  <string id="73350" soundid="158557">Of course. I can speak now or during our walk. Master Li suggested that I accompany you, in case you require assistance.</string>
  <string id="73351" soundid="158558">His workshop is in the center of the village by the gate, up the stairs from the square. It&apos;s the largest and most permanent building.</string>
  <string id="73352" soundid="158559">You must be tired if you are asking me about that. You&apos;ve talked to him many times.</string>
  <string id="73353" soundid="158560">You must be teasing me now. As I said, Gujin&apos;s workshop is by the village gate, the largest building up the stairs from the square, right where it has always been.</string>
  <string id="73354" soundid="158561">I don&apos;t want to go into this again. You know how I feel about my chi abilities. I don&apos;t want to talk about it.</string>
  <string id="73355" soundid="158562">I don&apos;t want to think about it too much. Manipulating chi has not come as naturally to me as it has to you. The things I do are... different.</string>
  <string id="73356" soundid="99381">Who would have thought Hapless Han would lose? At least, not like *that.*</string>
  <string id="73357" soundid="158563">I can see spirit shapes and hear the odd whisper. Master Li was surprised, but he has not had time to look into it further. Your training is his primary interest.</string>
  <string id="73358" soundid="158564">Hopefully, I&apos;ll find my skills useful for more than just keeping me up at night. Could we go on to something else?</string>
  <string id="73359" soundid="158565">We are all spiritual creatures. When we die, our spirits are released to find their way to the underworld. The journey eases the transition from life to death.</string>
  <string id="73360" soundid="158566">If their time among the living was troubled or painful, spirits sometimes get lost. They can seem almost alive and are often mistaken for living creatures.</string>
  <string id="73361" soundid="158567">They usually only appear for a short time. They say what they need to say and then are drawn to the underworld.</string>
  <string id="73362" soundid="158568">If a person&apos;s life was very traumatic, his or her spirit can lose its way for a long time. They can go mad trapped in the world of the living.</string>
  <string id="73363" soundid="158569">Maddened spirits change. They lose their connection to the living world and begin to channel darker emotions. They can be very dangerous.</string>
  <string id="73364" soundid="158570">I&apos;ve only seen hints of those. It&apos;s been enough. I&apos;m very worried about what may be coming.</string>
  <string id="73365" soundid="158571">I don&apos;t know. That&apos;s the kind of thing old men sit on mountains to discover. Some say it is a place of judgment. Maybe it&apos;s about reincarnation.</string>
  <string id="73366" soundid="158572">You&apos;d think we could just ask the spirits themselves, but if we can&apos;t really understand our own answers, how can we hope to fathom theirs?</string>
  <string id="73367" soundid="158573">I know that people should not be able to do what that assassin sorcerer did. Summoning ghosts like that... I thought spirits drifted to the underworld.</string>
  <string id="73368" soundid="158574">We should get your weapon as quickly as we can. I am honored that Master Li feels I am worthy of standing beside you.</string>
  <string id="73369" soundid="158575"></string>
  <string id="73370" soundid="158576">Then we should return to Master Li so he can talk to you about this attack.</string>
  <string id="73371" soundid="158577">Then you should address Gao&apos;s challenge. Return to Master Li, and he will signal for it to begin.</string>
  <string id="73372" soundid="158578">Do not distance yourself too much from the rest of us. What does Master Li say? That you should keep the basics close to heart?</string>
  <string id="73373" soundid="158579">I like hearing about the great things you are destined for, even if they are unknown. You are filled with promise. My skills are darker.</string>
  <string id="73374" soundid="158580">I don&apos;t like your &quot;bad feelings.&quot; They always end up being right. Remember the grass fire? Half of the fields gone in a day, and you knew it would happen.</string>

  <string id="73377" soundid="158535">I know all about the necromancy of the Lotus Assassins! Take your false hope and go, or I&apos;ll.... Wait.</string>

  <string id="73379" soundid="158537">You are one of Master Li&apos;s students! You... you are the one who killed my Gao!</string>
  <string id="73380" soundid="158538">Your words mean nothing! You are a murderer, a killer! Gao was everything to me, and now he is gone!</string>
  <string id="73381" soundid="158539">Damn you and that school! My Gao was never good enough for Master Li; you were always his prize pupil. And now my son is...</string>
  <string id="73382" soundid="158540">Enough, Gao! This troublemaker has disrupted our plans from the beginning. It had to be them in the ruins, and someone aided the troublesome Lord Yun in the forest.</string>
  <string id="73387">I didn&apos;t want to kill him. He left me no choice.</string>
  <string id="73388">Gao brought his fate on himself.</string>
  <string id="73390">I enjoyed killing your son... now I&apos;m going to kill you!</string>
  <string id="73391" soundid="99458">Off you go. Soldier and I have things to discuss.</string>
  <string id="73393">Do you know anything about recruiters for the Lotus Assassins?</string>
  <string id="73395">Tell me about yourself.</string>
  <string id="73398">What sort of things do you keep an eye on?</string>
  <string id="73399">What can you tell me about Kai Lan the Serpent?</string>
  <string id="73402">Tell me more about Lucky Cho.</string>
  <string id="73404">Can we talk about you and Soldier again?</string>
  <string id="73405">How do you help Soldier train?</string>
  <string id="73406">Soldier suffers from a lot of tension, does he?</string>
  <string id="73408">Let&apos;s change the subject entirely.</string>
  <string id="73409">Can I ask you some questions about the city?</string>
  <string id="73410">I should get back to what I was doing.</string>
  <string id="73431">How was the Empire formed?</string>
  <string id="73432" soundid="144388">Ha! It doesn&apos;t take a scholar to see that I&apos;m hardly normal! Real warriors are large, strong, and aren&apos;t folded in half before getting to the battle field.</string>

  <string id="73480">Grab a bottle and use Drunken Master to defeat the ghost.</string>
  <string id="73481">Speak with Captain Ing</string>
  <string id="73482">Sheng said one of the locals would give you a reward for closing the dam. Speak with Captain Ing by the Beggar&apos;s Pier before closing the dam.</string>
  <string id="73483">Minister Sheng said the Lotus Assassins opened the dam to search for something in the ruins of old Tien&apos;s Landing. They don&apos;t care about the hardship they are causing the town. Sheng gave you a key to the ruins hoping you can close the dam. He also mentioned Captain Ing, a local man that would give a reward if you talk to him first.</string>
  <string id="73485">This is your problem, not mine. I don&apos;t have time to waste on you.</string>
  <string id="73492">Flooded Ruins</string>
  <string id="73495">With the flooding of the ruins of the old Tien&apos;s Landing, there&apos;s no way you can reach the orphan spirits. Hopefully they have found some peace in the waters.</string>
  <string id="73513">There&apos;s nothing else I need from you, Qui.</string>
  <string id="73521" soundid="108341">This does not concern you, child.</string>
  <string id="73522">Of course. Silly of me to bring it up. What were you saying?</string>
  <string id="73523">I&apos;ll just mark you down as an idiot. Carry on.</string>
  <string id="73524">Seriously, you&apos;re using the wrong words, it makes you sound like a fool.</string>
  <string id="73526">Continue to examine me so closely and that&apos;s not all I will grab, dog!</string>
  <string id="73528">What are you getting at?</string>
  <string id="73529">You size me up like market day livestock!</string>
  <string id="73534">You cannot resist us.</string>
  <string id="73539">Before I agree to anything, I need to know the rules of this tournament.</string>

  <string id="73543" soundid="108344"></string>
  <string id="73544" soundid="108345">Wait. Before we go any further, I just need to make sure you understand what you are getting into.</string>
  <string id="73581" soundid="105423">Let me know if you need something. I&apos;ll be around.</string>
  <string id="73584" soundid="105448">I wish I could have helped fight the bandits, but Master Li ordered everyone to stay here.</string>
  <string id="73585" soundid="105449">I wish I had seen Master Li destroy the bandits. That style he used sounded impressive.</string>
  <string id="73586" soundid="105450">Master Li does not demonstrate his skills very often. He must have been very concerned for your safety.</string>
  <string id="73587" soundid="105451">Smiling Mountain has been telling us to study your moves in his training sessions since the bandits came.</string>
  <string id="73590" soundid="105454">Why would bandits attack the village? I guess there are fewer travelers to attack because of the ghost rumors.</string>
  <string id="73591" soundid="105455">The village is lucky that Master Li is here to protect it. He would never let anything bad happen to Two Rivers.</string>
  <string id="73596" soundid="105460">You place yourself in a precarious position, my young friend.</string>
  <string id="73597" soundid="105461">I would hate to see your career stagnate.</string>
  <string id="73598" soundid="105462">You see.... What is that noise?</string>
  <string id="73599" soundid="105463">Damn you, Serpent! I&apos;ll kill you where you stand!</string>
  <string id="73600" soundid="105464">No you won&apos;t, Whirlwind.</string>
  <string id="73601" soundid="105465">Just like last time, you will leave. I can see that this polite discussion has concluded, as so many do in your odorous presence.</string>
  <string id="73602" soundid="105466">We may talk again. Perhaps.</string>
  <string id="73603" soundid="105717">Just go away. You&apos;ve hurt me enough already.</string>
  <string id="73604" soundid="105718">Hello again, honorable one. Did you get the chance to speak with Ai Ling? Is she going to leave me alone now?</string>
  <string id="73605" soundid="105719">I understand. I hope this gets settled before my next scheduled beating. I&apos;m not sure how much more I can take.</string>
  <string id="73606" soundid="105720">What? That&apos;s preposterous! She&apos;s lying. Lan&apos;s the only woman I ever proposed to. I don&apos;t know why Ai Ling would say something like that!</string>
  <string id="73607" soundid="105721">If Lan heard these lies... well, I don&apos;t know what she&apos;d do. Please, see if you can get this straightened out with Ai Ling, before these rumors get back to my fiancée. </string>
  <string id="73609" soundid="105723">Hey, Baker Bei, how are you today?</string>
  <string id="73610" soundid="105724">Go away! I told you I want no part of this. Tell Ai Ling to leave me alone!</string>
  <string id="73611" soundid="105475">Public displays of rage and drunkenness, uttered threats of murder, excessive violence, property damage and, I believe, several charges of defecating in public.</string>
  <string id="73612" soundid="105476">If you trust him, you are a fool. The Black Whirlwind is an impressive fighter, but he is better avoided than confronted.</string>
  <string id="73613" soundid="105477">To become champion yourself you will need my support. That means you and I will work together closely.</string>
  <string id="73614" soundid="105478">An amicable arrangement. One that will benefit both of us.</string>
  <string id="73615" soundid="105479">A wise position to take in any negotiation. I can respect that.</string>
  <string id="73616">Nothing I don&apos;t already know. I can accept him as he is.</string>
  <string id="73618">The fool&apos;s almost more trouble than he&apos;s worth.</string>
  <string id="73619">I&apos;m interested. What are you proposing?</string>
  <string id="73621">Tell me your offer before I decide anything.</string>
  <string id="73623">I want nothing to do with you, Serpent.</string>
  <string id="73630" soundid="198540"></string>
  <string id="73631" soundid="105725">If you want to tell Ai Ling something, go tell her yourself. In the meantime, we have our orders. Nothing personal.</string>
  <string id="73632" soundid="105726">It&apos;s a little personal with me. I like sticking your face in the gutter.</string>
  <string id="73633" soundid="107796">You were never in any real danger, but now the crowd knows you&apos;re no average warrior.</string>
  <string id="73634" soundid="107797">I understand your consterns. We wanted to test the demon against an exceptional fighter, you see.</string>
  <string id="73635" soundid="105729">Can you believe that these thugs would just attack me in broad daylight like that?</string>
  <string id="73636" soundid="105730">They... they might have killed me if you hadn&apos;t stepped in. Thank you. I never expected such help from a stranger.</string>
  <string id="73639" soundid="105733">You spoke to Lan? How humiliating! My fiancée must have told you I can&apos;t protect myself. The woman I love doesn&apos;t have any faith in me! Oh, the shame! I&apos;ll never live this down.</string>
  <string id="73641" soundid="105735">Those thugs are acting on Ai Ling&apos;s orders. She&apos;s the head of their gang. They have a small hideout in the boathouse.</string>
  <string id="73642" soundid="105736">I didn&apos;t mean to sound ungrateful. I&apos;m just worried about Lan. She&apos;s very emotional. I&apos;ve done my best to try and keep her from becoming involved in this.</string>
  <string id="73643" soundid="105737">Ai Ling and I were friends when we were children, but we drifted apart as we grew up. She fell in with some rough people... as you&apos;ve already seen.</string>
  <string id="73644" soundid="105738">Ever since I got engaged, Ai Ling has become obsessed with me. Every day she sends her thugs to beat me up. She says she won&apos;t stop until I go talk to her.</string>
  <string id="73646" soundid="105740">Thank you so much! Ai Ling and her thugs are in the boathouse. Please, just ask her to leave me alone. All we want is to live our lives in peace.</string>
  <string id="73648" soundid="105742">No, don&apos;t do that! Ai Ling and I were friends once, even if it was a long time ago. I... I don&apos;t want to see her dead. Not if there&apos;s another way.</string>
  <string id="73652" soundid="105746">You! How could you do this to me? Lan just told me our marriage is off! She said you told her I promised to marry Ai Ling!</string>
  <string id="73653" soundid="107798">I&apos;m convinced that you deserve a shot at Crimson Khana. Your victory has sealed the deal.</string>
  <string id="73654">Why wasn&apos;t I warned?</string>
  <string id="73655">You want to settle this with fists?</string>
  <string id="73656">A promise is a promise, Bei.</string>
  <string id="73657">I&apos;m still looking into it.</string>
  <string id="73658">Ai Ling says you promised to marry her.</string>
  <string id="73669">Involved in what, exactly?</string>
  <string id="73671">Quit whining, or you might still get a beating today.</string>
  <string id="73672">You better tell me what&apos;s going on.</string>
  <string id="73674">So why don&apos;t you go talk to her?</string>
  <string id="73675">Maybe I could talk to Ai Ling for you.</string>
  <string id="73677">I could kill Ai Ling. That would solve your problems.</string>
  <string id="73679">She has to be doing this for a reason.</string>
  <string id="73684">I&apos;m sorry. I didn&apos;t know.</string>
  <string id="73688" soundid="105782">Everyone thinks Bei and that little seamstress make such a nice couple... but Bei already promised to marry me!</string>
  <string id="73689" soundid="105783">That sounds like a threat. I don&apos;t respond well to threats. Besides, Bei&apos;s only getting what he deserves. He brought this on himself.</string>
  <string id="73694" soundid="105788">Bei promised to give me all that. He promised to marry me, and now he&apos;s trying to weasel out of it. But a promise is a promise. I won&apos;t forget that, even if he tries to.</string>
  <string id="73695" soundid="105789">Yeah, okay. If he has the guts to come here and face me, I&apos;ll talk to him. But I&apos;m not going to let him weasel out of his promise!</string>
  <string id="73697" soundid="105791">Yeah, you do that. Go tell Lan what kind of man Bei really is. See how she likes it when she finds out her perfect fiancé proposed to another woman!</string>
  <string id="73700" soundid="105794">So that&apos;s how it&apos;s going to be? You&apos;d rather fight me and my boys than make Baker Bei own up to what he did?</string>
  <string id="73701" soundid="105795">Nobody threatens me in here. Come on boys, time to do our thing!</string>
  <string id="73702" soundid="105796">Back again? Can&apos;t leave a girl alone, can you? Well, what do you want?</string>
  <string id="73704">I&apos;ll leave you two alone.</string>
  <string id="73705">What about my reward?</string>
  <string id="73736" soundid="124520">Wow, you sure are pretty! And you got a real nice club here for you and your friends. My name&apos;s Tian, but everyone calls me Big Tian &apos;cause I&apos;m so big.</string>
  <string id="73828" soundid="128334">I wondered how long it would be before you made your way down here. I&apos;m sure I don&apos;t need to tell you, but the air has changed considerably!</string>
  <string id="73829" soundid="128335">My family has always been tied to the Forest Shadow in some strange way, and I can tell she&apos;s dead. It&apos;s a shame, but looking at these trees, I can see why it had to be done.</string>
  <string id="73830" soundid="128336">I&apos;m just glad you were there to handle things. Dealing with a maddened fox might have been beyond my skill.</string>
  <string id="73831" soundid="128337">I imagine so. It was most unnerving to simply &quot;know&quot; that she was gone. How very strange. All for the best, I&apos;m sure.</string>
  <string id="73832" soundid="128338">The Forest Shadow herself appeared here in this camp while the earth shook. She explained what was happening on my lands.</string>

  <string id="73837" soundid="136869">Nevertheless, while I have lost a valuable pawn, I have not yet lost to *you*. We will meet in the heart of *my* Empire, when I am at the height of my power.</string>
  <string id="73839" soundid="128345">She explained what happened in the inn. Nasty business that. Glad you had the skills to deal with that... Mother, was it?</string>
  <string id="73840" soundid="128346">That they did. Imagine, such horrors trapped under my own land!</string>
  <string id="73841" soundid="128347">Do you not appreciate the value of a wind map? I risk death at the Assassins&apos; hands by even giving you a rough copy of one!</string>
  <string id="73842" soundid="128348">[Success] That is true. I&apos;ll not have it said that I ask people to place their lives on the line for a pittance. Here, take this purse; it should set us even.</string>

  <string id="73847" soundid="136871">Your master awaits you, child.</string>
  <string id="73848" soundid="128354">For now, I think I will look after this land. With the Forest Shadow gone, I&apos;m sure the trees will restore themselves in time.</string>

  <string id="73860">I&apos;ll go get Bei right now.</string>
  <string id="73861">I need to look into this some more.</string>
  <string id="73863" soundid="128356">We will stay on here for a while. These trees will need tending.</string>

  <string id="73895" soundid="136877">Sun Hai linked him to the stolen power of the Water Dragon, and bound him to my armor to taunt me. An unrelenting, unbeatable force that wore the face of my betrayal. Now he is mine.</string>

  <string id="73898" soundid="136880">Have my words so injured you in the past? There was no malice in my use of your talents. You were merely a tool, your destiny a convenient path to power.</string>

  <string id="73904" soundid="136884">What foolishness is this? Death has addled your senses. You bring up memories that are mine alone to bear, and then you claim that they are false?</string>
  <string id="73905" soundid="136885">I will not hear this. Your tongue profanes a place in my heart where no one is permitted.</string>

  <string id="73909" soundid="136889">If I had the emotions you think I should, I would have defended her or died at her side. But her death had no real meaning to me, so neither does her life.</string>

  <string id="73948" soundid="128418">What you see here is only a small segment of the Great Southern Forest. As you climb this path, you&apos;ll be able to see more of the forest stretching around us.</string>
  <string id="73949" soundid="128419">Normally, this forest is heavily traveled, with caravans moving north and south. As these are my lands, I collect a moderate income from their passage.</string>
  <string id="73950" soundid="128420">That is why I&apos;m so motivated to cure this place. I&apos;m sure that the ghosts are drawn here by the same force that&apos;s sickening the trees.</string>
  <string id="73951" soundid="128421">I know very little about the fox. My ancestors were said to have very good relations with her, but such things are frowned upon in this day and age.</string>
  <string id="73952" soundid="128422">I honestly don&apos;t remember. I&apos;m sure it was some highly romanticized legend passed down through the line of my fathers.</string>
  <string id="73953" soundid="128423">Knowing fox spirits, some ancestor of mine proved particularly worthy in a test of his honor.</string>
  <string id="73954" soundid="128424">That&apos;s always the way those silly stories go: A man or woman is tested and either rewarded or punished at the fox&apos;s whims.</string>
  <string id="73955" soundid="128425">Current sentiment in the court is decidedly secular. The Emperor has become distant where the heavens are concerned, and the court has adopted his attitudes.</string>
  <string id="73956" soundid="128426">Public displays of religious fervor among the lower classes are frowned upon, if not quickly silenced by the Lotus Assassins.</string>
  <string id="73957" soundid="128427">Between us, I think Death&apos;s Hand has influenced him. If the gods are ignored, then men are the final arbiters of right and wrong.</string>
  <string id="73958" soundid="128428">Death&apos;s Hand controls the Lotus Assassins, who judge and execute as they see fit. If the gods cannot interfere in that, then the Assassins hold all the power in the world.</string>
  <string id="73959" soundid="128429">Fox spirits are heaven&apos;s tricksters. They can assume human form and walk among us if they wish.</string>
  <string id="73960" soundid="128430">In most of the stories, they test men and women to see if their virtues and honor are true. Those who fail are punished, while those who pass are rewarded.</string>
  <string id="73961" soundid="128431">I don&apos;t know what to make of the situation in the forest, but I worry. There are other, darker tales of foxes who have no rhyme or reason to their actions. </string>
  <string id="73962" soundid="128432">They work apart from heaven and do whatever their whims guide them to do. More often than not, the humans pay the price of their capricious desires.</string>

  <string id="74064">It&apos;s a deal. I&apos;ll take care of those thugs for you.</string>
  <string id="74067">Keep your dowry... I&apos;ll help you anyway.</string>
  <string id="74069">This isn&apos;t my problem.</string>
  <string id="74070">Your sobbing is annoying me.</string>
  <string id="74071">Just keep it down.</string>
  <string id="74072">Maybe I can help.</string>
  <string id="74074">Not yet.</string>
  <string id="74075">I spoke to her.</string>
  <string id="74076">Her name is Ai Ling. Bei promised to marry her.</string>
  <string id="74082">Her name was Ai Ling. She won&apos;t be a problem anymore... she&apos;s dead.</string>
  <string id="74084" soundid="106178">That&apos;s why I cheer for Iron Soldier. He sneers at the crowds, the fighters, even the system, and none of them can defeat him.</string>
  <string id="74087" soundid="106181">May all nine orifices stay solvent, qualifier! </string>
  <string id="74089" soundid="106485">I&apos;m s-sorry. I meant no offense. I just want to do the best job I can, even if the task is just meant to keep me busy.</string>
  <string id="74092" soundid="106486">I d-did not mean to anger you, but the attack has given me a new appreciation for my task. We must always be wary, even if there is little danger of a second attack.</string>
  <string id="74094" soundid="106487">W...what do you mean? Some sort of test? Ask me anything, I am ready to try.</string>
  <string id="74095" soundid="143616">There are just certain things I prefer to deal with alone. I mean no offense.</string>
  <string id="74097" soundid="106489">Hello again. What can I do for you?</string>
  <string id="74098" soundid="106490">Master Li was looking to speak with you, wasn&apos;t he? After he left me here, he went back to his house in the center of the school, if you&apos;re looking for him.</string>
  <string id="74122" soundid="142899"></string>
  <string id="74126">Master Li! Listen to me, it does not have to be this way!</string>
  <string id="74153" soundid="106491">The school has been closed due to the bandit attack. You will have to fight the bandits while I wait for Master Li to return with Kia Min, the wounded student.</string>
  <string id="74154" soundid="106492">You don&apos;t understand. I don&apos;t know how to fight. I only just arrived, and Master Li has delayed my training to attend to some other matter.</string>
  <string id="74155" soundid="106493">It is to my shame, but I am just not able to wade into that bandit attack. I will guard the gate as best I can, but that is all I can do.</string>
  <string id="74156" soundid="106494">I can&apos;t! I only just arrived, and Master Li has delayed my training to attend to some other matter!</string>
  <string id="74157" soundid="106495">I wish I could, but I am just not able. I will guard the gate as best I can, but I can&apos;t wade into a bandit attack.</string>
  <string id="74158" soundid="106496">I will try.</string>
  <string id="74159" soundid="106497">They are swarming on the beach.</string>
  <string id="74160" soundid="106498">I knew you would not let those bandits overrun the village. I hope I equal your skill some day.</string>
  <string id="74163">To the Lotus Assassin Fortress</string>
  <string id="74164">I don&apos;t like surprises. From now on, I want to know what I&apos;m fighting and why.</string>
  <string id="74165">Could I ask you some questions?</string>
  <string id="74166">Guarding the school gate doesn&apos;t seem like a complicated job.</string>
  <string id="74169">Answer when I address you, student!</string>
  <string id="74170">Go on about your task, then.</string>
  <string id="74171" soundid="154525">Bandits are coming here? What do they want with Two Rivers?</string>
  <string id="74172">If you are guarding this gate, let&apos;s make sure you know how to defend it.</string>
  <string id="74173">Goodbye.</string>
  <string id="74174">Never mind.</string>
  <string id="74175">Any help is welcome. Come to the beach.</string>
  <string id="74177">Coward! Get a weapon and move!</string>
  <string id="74179">Very well. Let no one through!</string>
  <string id="74180">Bandit Leader</string>
  <string id="74183" soundid="158316">What? Oh, hello there. Don&apos;t let Zhong bother you. He&apos;s really quite harmless. He&apos;s just a little... upset right now.</string>
  <string id="74184" soundid="107074">You&apos;d be angry, too, if you had to stand here and listen to *your* babble! Now get out!</string>
  <string id="74185" soundid="107075">I&apos;m not angry at all, just sad that you&apos;ll soon be dead if you don&apos;t get out of my dining hall!</string>

  <string id="74189" soundid="162079">These mindless hordes...they were just a diversion. You beat them all, but now *he* is coming.</string>
  <string id="74190" soundid="107080">So, you&apos;ve rid us of that pesky Master Radiant. Well, good riddance, I say. I don&apos;t like spirits in my home. Even the good ones.</string>
  <string id="74191" soundid="107081">It&apos;s about time somebody dealt with that rogue Smiling Hawk. Of course, now I have to clean up the mess you two made!</string>
  <string id="74192" soundid="107082">Yes, mistress... I mean no, mistress!</string>
  <string id="74193" soundid="107083">Get out! Get out of here before I break your skull open, you little rat!</string>

  <string id="74290" soundid="139542">Yes... First Brother. I... apologize for my outburst.</string>
  <string id="74291" soundid="139543">I&apos;m very sorry about that. We are not accustomed to having visitors. My name is First Brother Kai. Welcome to the Black Leopard School.</string>
  <string id="74292" soundid="139544">No, nothing more than usual. Normally this kind of thing would never happen.</string>

  <string id="74366" soundid="103006">Your match could end in death. It almost happened when Sung Bu faced him alone, and he was the last opponent to tackle the champion alone.</string>
  <string id="74367" soundid="103007">The Ravager grows more fierce with each fight, as if time were making him stronger. If you face him, we may not be able to end the match in time.</string>

  <string id="74416" soundid="105033">Why do you need to ask? A bandit attack isn&apos;t of enough interest? What else would people talk about?</string>
  <string id="74418">Everyone is needed. Get ready to fight.</string>
  <string id="74421">Coward! Get your weapons ready!</string>
  <string id="74424">Forget it. Your shame is your own to deal with.</string>

  <string id="74443" soundid="107050">It&apos;s been quite a while since we faced each other. It will be nice to have another chance to deal with you.</string>

  <string id="74445" soundid="105062">I&apos;m glad I stuck around to see Kai Lan finished. You&apos;ve got guts and skill. You might even be better than me, you know?</string>
  <string id="74446" soundid="105063">You&apos;ve got to finish this thing. The Ravager&apos;s nothing. You need to eliminate Kai Lan, or he&apos;ll just make things worse.</string>
  <string id="74447" soundid="105064">I&apos;m going to stay around and keep tabs on you. I expect things will be interesting around here for the next little while.</string>
  <string id="74448" soundid="105065">Careful, girl. I might have rolled over once, but you let your guard down and you&apos;re mine!</string>
  <string id="74449" soundid="105066">Don&apos;t think that I&apos;m going to forget that *you* were the one to take my division from me.</string>
  <string id="74450" soundid="108734">Uhhh, yeah. That could be tricky.</string>
  <string id="74451" soundid="105068">I learned about the guards the hard way. Of course, they learned about me too!</string>
  <string id="74452" soundid="105069">It must be hard working yourself into that foul a temper each day.</string>
  <string id="74453" soundid="105070">If you hate pretty much everyone, it&apos;s easy enough.</string>
  <string id="74454" soundid="105071">Ignore this trash. He&apos;s been mocking the Imperial Army for years with his name, and I can&apos;t think why they haven&apos;t dealt with him yet.</string>
  <string id="74455" soundid="105072">I bet you really haul in the fans with that attitude.</string>
  <string id="74456" soundid="105073">Real men don&apos;t need people stroking their ego all the time.</string>
  <string id="74457" soundid="105074">Ya Zhen: This Iron Soldier&apos;s made a career of being a miserable cur while beating the tar out of people. He has potential!</string>
  <string id="74458" soundid="105075">Iron Soldier&apos;s fame comes as much from his foul temper and ego as it does from his skill. The people love to despise him.</string>
  <string id="74459" soundid="105076">If you can&apos;t bend without cutting yourself on morality, you&apos;re no good in a real fight.</string>
  <string id="74460" soundid="107816">Not much to do at the top is there, champion?</string>
  <string id="74461" soundid="105078">Go on and keep climbing the ranks. If you get high enough, you might just break your neck when you fall.</string>
  <string id="74462" soundid="105079">The crowd loves it. They need someone to hate, and I give them that. You might be popular now while everyone loves you, but hate lasts.</string>
  <string id="74463" soundid="105080">Given half the chance, yes! If you can&apos;t handle it, you don&apos;t need to talk to me.</string>
  <string id="74464" soundid="105081">Don&apos;t go getting all soft on me. You keep focused on the Gold Division.</string>
  <string id="74468" soundid="108735">Indeed. The gentleman with you has already gotten a head start on things.</string>
  <string id="74485" soundid="105119">Hey, you&apos;re the woman the captain said to look out for! He said to tell you thank you very much, and to give you this.</string>
  <string id="74486" soundid="105120">I think he couldn&apos;t wait to get out on the river... and as soon as the water came back, he left!</string>
  <string id="74487" soundid="105121">Thanks so much! Wow, now I can eat for another day. Does it get better than this?</string>

  <string id="74490" soundid="105124">Some people give faithful messengers a tip. But then, some people are nice.</string>
  <string id="74494">Thank you. Here&apos;s a silver piece.</string>
  <string id="74496">Thank you. Goodbye.</string>
  <string id="74498">Go away.</string>
  <string id="74503" soundid="107085">Now, don&apos;t go getting jealous. You&apos;re a fine fighter and a good friend, but I have no interest in you. But her... what a woman!</string>
  <string id="74504" soundid="107086">Don&apos;t be getting any ideas, now! She&apos;s not your type, anyway. I don&apos;t want to have to fight you for her, but I will, if I have to.</string>
  <string id="74505" soundid="107087">I&apos;m glad we understand each other. Look... here she comes.</string>
  <string id="74506" soundid="107088">This isn&apos;t a public restaurant. We only serve the students here. You&apos;ll have to go back to the city if you&apos;re hungry.</string>
  <string id="74507" soundid="107089">Don&apos;t mind us, mistress. We just wanted to know how you came about your beautiful name. It seems so... fitting.</string>
  <string id="74508" soundid="107090">Don&apos;t patronize me, you overgrown tree stump! I had a beautiful singing voice... but it was ruined during a freak costume incident during an opera I was performing.</string>
  <string id="74509" soundid="107091">Don&apos;t flatter me. I&apos;ve had enough of that throughout my life. I once sang for the Emperor himself. I may not have my voice... but I still have my dignity!</string>
  <string id="74510" soundid="107092">That&apos;s really too bad, mistress. I would enjoy hearing you sing. Perhaps over a bowl of wine sometime?</string>
  <string id="74511" soundid="107093">I&apos;d rather be dipped in boiling oil and fed to cannibals! Now get out of my dining hall! I have work to do!</string>
  <string id="74513" soundid="107095">Good. I have better things to do than to stand around and talk to strangers all day long.</string>
  <string id="74514" soundid="107096">What a woman!</string>
  <string id="74517" soundid="158157">Now you see why I need you. You have the power to deal death to the spirits... to Radiant!</string>
  <string id="74519" soundid="107101">You again! If you don&apos;t get out of my dining hall, I&apos;ll throw you out myself!</string>
  <string id="74521">Zin Bu the Magic Abacus</string>
  <string id="74522" soundid="107104">Yes, what is it this time?</string>
  <string id="74523" soundid="107105">Because I have to deal with little runts like you all day long! Now get out!</string>
  <string id="74527">Why are you so angry all the time?</string>
  <string id="74528">I just wanted to ask you some questions.</string>
  <string id="74529">Tell me more about yourself.</string>
  <string id="74530">Tell me about the Black Leopard School.</string>
  <string id="74531">What do you know about the masters?</string>
  <string id="74532">Nothing. I should be going.</string>
  <string id="74534">Really? I didn&apos;t think she&apos;d be your type.</string>
  <string id="74535">You a have very... discerning taste in women, I see.</string>
  <string id="74536">That&apos;s an image I&apos;d rather not have in my mind.</string>
  <string id="74537">That&apos;s... too bad. But you must follow your heart.</string>
  <string id="74538">I&apos;m... sorry to hear that, Black Whirlwind.</string>
  <string id="74539">She&apos;s a very... fortunate woman.</string>
  <string id="74540">Don&apos;t worry, Black Whirlwind. She&apos;s all yours.</string>
  <string id="74541">I wouldn&apos;t dream of it. Honest.</string>
  <string id="74542">If you insist, I&apos;ll let you have her.</string>
  <string id="74546">Well, it&apos;s still a beautiful name.</string>
  <string id="74550">Could I ask you some questions?</string>
  <string id="74552">We should be going now. Goodbye.</string>
  <string id="74557" soundid="107139">What do you want? You&apos;re working for Purveyor Shouji aren&apos;t you? Please don&apos;t tell him I haven&apos;t gone yet. I&apos;m going now... even though it will probably get me killed.</string>
  <string id="74558" soundid="107140">You... don&apos;t know the purveyor? I&apos;m sorry... I thought... never mind. I&apos;m Jinlin. Is there something you want?</string>
  <string id="74559" soundid="151787">A startling revelation from Kang.</string>
  <string id="74560" soundid="123305"></string>
  <string id="74561">Never mind. I should be going.</string>
  <string id="74562">Mostrar Sangue</string>

  <string id="74573" soundid="107155">I&apos;m... sorry. I&apos;m just a little upset. I... I&apos;m Jinlin. Is there something you want?</string>
  <string id="74574" soundid="107156">Thanks, but I need to find a way to kill spirits. Purveyor Shouji wants me to fetch an artifact from an emperor&apos;s tomb in the Necropolis, but it&apos;s filled with ghosts.</string>
  <string id="74575" soundid="107157">The purveyor is... he threatened to sell my mom to slave traders if I don&apos;t get this artifact. I don&apos;t know what to do... I can&apos;t fight ghosts.</string>
  <string id="74576" soundid="107158">My father worked for Purveyor Shouji until he... died. He left last week to retrieve the same artifact for the purveyor. The ghosts must have... killed him.</string>
  <string id="74577" soundid="107159">When my father disappeared, he had some of the purveyor&apos;s equipment. Now Purveyor Shouji says we must repay him.</string>
  <string id="74578" soundid="107160">My mother works for him, but I don&apos;t know where he&apos;s taken her... and I have to sneak around ghosts and other beasts to fetch the purveyor&apos;s trinkets and baubles.</string>
  <string id="74579" soundid="107161">I only know what Shouji told me, and that&apos;s not much. He called it a... pestle and mortar. It&apos;s a bowl and a mixer, I think. He said it had something to do with a recipe.</string>
  <string id="74580" soundid="107162">I don&apos;t know if you use it to make something, or if the recipe is in the bowl already. Anyway, the purveyor is very interested in it. I&apos;ve never seen him so anxious.</string>
  <string id="74581" soundid="107163">Purveyor doesn&apos;t do that kind of work. He likes to get other people to do it for him. Besides, the tomb is locked from the inside, but there&apos;s a small opening.</string>
  <string id="74582" soundid="107164">He says I&apos;m small enough to fit through the crack in the wall. I don&apos;t mind that as much as the ghosts. The tomb is filled with them. Once I&apos;m in, I&apos;ll just be killed.</string>
  <string id="74588" soundid="107170">Really? It would be very dangerous, and I don&apos;t have anything to give you in return. Are you sure you want to do this?</string>
  <string id="74589" soundid="107171">Thank you... you are very kind. My father would have liked you, I think. He was brave like you are.</string>
  <string id="74590" soundid="107172">I... see. Well, thank you just the same. I don&apos;t know what I would have done if you hadn&apos;t offered.</string>
  <string id="74591" soundid="107173">The tomb is over in the Necropolis. The door is locked, but I can sneak inside and open it. I just have to be careful not to alert the ghosts.</string>
  <string id="74592" soundid="107174">If you really think you can get rid of the ghosts, I&apos;ll head over to the tomb and wait for you there.</string>
  <string id="74593" soundid="107175">Great. I&apos;ll wait by the steps of the emperor&apos;s tomb. I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll find it easily enough. See you soon, I hope.</string>
  <string id="74594" soundid="107176">I... understand. I&apos;m scared of the ghosts, too. Well, I should get going. Bye.</string>
  <string id="74595" soundid="107177">Oh... goodbye then.</string>
  <string id="74596" soundid="107178">Oh, hello again. Is there something you want?</string>
  <string id="74597">Calm down. I&apos;m not with the purveyor.</string>
  <string id="74598">Who are you, and who is this purveyor?</string>
  <string id="74600">I&apos;ll be there shortly.</string>
  <string id="74601">Hmm. Maybe I&apos;ll reconsider.</string>
  <string id="74602">I think I&apos;ll pass. Good luck.</string>
  <string id="74603">No, nothing at all. Goodbye.</string>
  <string id="74623">There&apos;s no need to get hostile.</string>
  <string id="74624">I saw what happened earlier. I&apos;d like to help you.</string>
  <string id="74625">I just thought you might need some help.</string>
  <string id="74627">Why are you working for the purveyor?</string>
  <string id="74630">I should be going now.</string>
  <string id="74631">Tell me more about this artifact.</string>
  <string id="74633">Why doesn&apos;t the purveyor get the artifact himself?</string>
  <string id="74642">Perhaps I could get rid of the ghosts for you.</string>

  <string id="75363" soundid="108371">I just want to make sure you are ready for this fortress. We have faced a few of these Lotus Assassins, but not on their home ground.</string>

  <string id="75371" soundid="108379">Just please hurry. As soon as you get the evidence Silk Fox wants against Death&apos;s Hand, we can get to the palace and rescue Master Li.</string>
  <string id="75372" soundid="108380">I guess that&apos;s all that really matters.</string>

  <string id="75864" soundid="110447">Well, now I think I will decline your interest. If I wished to be ignored, I could have stayed by my father&apos;s side.</string>
  <string id="75866">[Charm] It was not intentional, I assure you. I was devoting time to the things you want done.</string>

  <string id="75902" soundid="110490">You did it! You killed Gao the Greater--or Gao the Corpse, as I&apos;m going to call him now. Let this be a lesson to anyone else who wants to take over my operations!</string>
  <string id="75903" soundid="110491">Pirate Cheung is back in business! No more airships, no more Lotus Assassins. Just like the good old days!</string>
  <string id="75904" soundid="110492">What? Oh, right. I guess I just got caught up in the moment. You can&apos;t blame an old pirate for wanting to relive his glory days... even if they are gone forever.</string>
  <string id="75905" soundid="110493">I&apos;d join up with you, but my bones are old and tired. I can&apos;t go to any of the nearby villages. People might remember who I am... er, who I was. Pirates aren&apos;t popular around here.</string>
  <string id="75906" soundid="110494">I&apos;d like to stay here on the island. There are plenty of supplies, not to mention fish and fresh water. Now that Gao&apos;s gone, I can&apos;t think of anywhere else I&apos;d rather be.</string>
  <string id="75907" soundid="110495">Funny. I always thought I&apos;d end my days dangling from the end of a rope or stabbed in the back by another pirate.</string>
  <string id="75908" soundid="110496">I guess this is about as good an ending as Pirate Cheung could ever hope for. At least I got to see Gao get what he deserved!</string>

  <string id="77393" soundid="112230">It&apos;s a thankless job. Never so much as a smile or wave as I labor over my work. If it wasn&apos;t for me, this place would fall apart.</string>
  <string id="77394" soundid="112231">Good. I have work to do.</string>
  <string id="77395" soundid="112232">You&apos;re the student, you tell me. What is there to tell? The boys come and learn to fight, and they think that&apos;s all there is to the world.</string>
  <string id="77396" soundid="112233">Learning and fighting... they are very good at both, but put any one of them in a room with a lady and they&apos;d just wither away.</string>

  <string id="77398" soundid="112235">I&apos;m surprised they even let you join. Never seen a girl in here except to help with the cooking or the cleaning. I hope you knock some sense into those boys.</string>
  <string id="77399" soundid="112236">Masters! Ha! I&apos;m the only master of this school. Those other two hide in their rooms all day long doing who knows what.</string>
  <string id="77400" soundid="112237">How can you be a master of anything when you never participate? It&apos;s unnatural. Of course, it wasn&apos;t always that way, or at least, that&apos;s what I&apos;ve heard.</string>
  <string id="77401" soundid="112238">There was only one master once. Makes sense to me. Too many cooks in the kitchen, as I always say.</string>

  <string id="77485" soundid="112396">It might not be wise to run to the officials with this, but surely we should warn Crimson Khana.</string>
  <string id="77486" soundid="112397">From what I&apos;ve gathered, the bribes flowing from this place would make telling the officials useless, but what if we told Khana herself?</string>
  <string id="77487" soundid="112398">If you&apos;re set on this course, consider telling the sword mistress what you have done. That way, at least someone will appreciate you refusing such a ripe opportunity.</string>
  <string id="77488" soundid="112399">This Khana woman would appreciate knowing what you have learned.</string>

  <string id="77682" soundid="112831">It&apos;s nothing personal if that&apos;s what you&apos;re wondering. He just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.</string>
  <string id="77683" soundid="112832">It&apos;s quite simple really. They abduct people, usually those who won&apos;t be missed, and then they sell them. It pays very well.</string>
  <string id="77684" soundid="112833">Most of the slaves find their way to the Wall or into the hands of the Lotus Assassins. </string>
  <string id="77685" soundid="112834">Don&apos;t worry. I don&apos;t mind you knowing our secrets. You&apos;ll either leave here, bought and paid for, or you won&apos;t leave at all.</string>
  <string id="77686" soundid="112835">Chandler Ling is a respected merchant, just as he would tell you himself. Of course, he&apos;s also a facilitator for the guild.</string>
  <string id="77687" soundid="112836">Chandler Ling is very good at arranging things, and has a special gift for the seamless and virtually undetectable trade of... sensitive cargo.</string>
  <string id="77688" soundid="112837">He&apos;s not a bad man, really. He&apos;s just a very good businessman who knows a deal when he sees one. He is very well paid for what he does.</string>
  <string id="77689" soundid="112838">Good to see you&apos;re as reasonable as you are skilled at fighting. As to Songtao, I&apos;ve already taken care of it.</string>
  <string id="77690" soundid="112839">I have documents that confirm the existence of the slave traders and our actions. I&apos;ve made sure that Songtao&apos;s signature appears regularly throughout.</string>
  <string id="77691" soundid="112840">Of course the information is accurate, if somewhat out-of-date. With these documents, the prefect will have no choice but to convict the scholar... and free Ling.</string>
  <string id="77692" soundid="112841">Go now. Give the prefect these documents. I&apos;ll clean up here. Ling will see to your payment. Go... and remember, do not tell anyone what you know.</string>
  <string id="77693" soundid="112842">Go now; do not linger here any longer. I will deal with this mess.</string>
  <string id="77694" soundid="155719">Did you see Gao when he went by? There was fire in his eyes!</string>
  <string id="77695">&lt;FullName&gt;. I&apos;m here to clear the name of Scholar Songtao.</string>
  <string id="77696">I&apos;m interested in your little business arrangement.</string>
  <string id="77698">I&apos;m the one who will slaughter every one of you slavers.</string>
  <string id="77702">Never! This ends now.</string>
  <string id="77703">Go on. I&apos;m listening.</string>
  <string id="77704">You couldn&apos;t afford me!</string>
  <string id="77708">No! I won&apos;t betray Scholar Songtao. He&apos;s innocent.</string>
  <string id="77709">This ends now!</string>
  <string id="77710">I want to ask you some questions before I decide.</string>
  <string id="77711">Tell me who you are.</string>
  <string id="77712">This has gone too far. It must end now!</string>
  <string id="77713">Why is Scholar Songtao being implicated?</string>
  <string id="77715">What are the slave traders doing exactly?</string>
  <string id="77718">Who is Chandler Ling, really?</string>
  <string id="77721">All right. But how do I implicate Songtao?</string>
  <string id="77724">Give me the documents and I&apos;ll get Ling freed.</string>
  <string id="77725" soundid="112874">I don&apos;t know why you&apos;re wasting your time. I&apos;m obviously innocent, and yet you still want to risk yourself needlessly.</string>
  <string id="77726" soundid="112875">I&apos;m no fool. Those men haven&apos;t returned, and I can assure you it isn&apos;t because they&apos;ve decided to take a holiday.</string>
  <string id="77727" soundid="112876">Chasing after criminals is dangerous work; obviously there are risks involved.</string>
  <string id="77728" soundid="112877">Why would you risk yourself when even the local minister seems to be content with the scholar&apos;s arrest?</string>
  <string id="77729" soundid="112878">Of course, do what you need to. If you discover anything, it will only prove my innocence further. Good luck.</string>
  <string id="77730" soundid="112879">What&apos;s to tell? I&apos;m a merchant, and quite a good one. My clients are usually very happy with my goods.</string>
  <string id="77731" soundid="112880">You likely haven&apos;t heard of me simply because I have a very elite clientele. The average person on the street cannot afford the items I sell.</string>
  <string id="77732" soundid="112881">Other than my occupation, I suspect we are very much the same, you and I. Though I happen to be a little more... restricted than you at the moment.</string>
  <string id="77733" soundid="112882">Doing? I wasn&apos;t doing anything more than I usually do in a day&apos;s work. I was selling my wares to a few of my preferred clients. Prefect Jitong was one of them.</string>
  <string id="77734" soundid="112883">The next thing I know, guards confiscate my goods and tell me I&apos;m suspected of slave trading. It was likely the most ludicrous thing I&apos;ve ever been told.</string>
  <string id="77735" soundid="112884">Of course the prefect claims that some of my items belonged to his missing men, but that doesn&apos;t mean I took the items from their lifeless bodies.</string>
  <string id="77736" soundid="112885">In a given day, I meet with several buyers, and probably twice as many sellers. There are always more sellers than buyers.</string>
  <string id="77737" soundid="112886">My job is to determine whether something is worth buying, not whether the seller is worth buying from. If I see a bargain, I don&apos;t care who the seller is.</string>
  <string id="77738" soundid="112887">Suffice to say, those items could be from any number of sellers. I don&apos;t recall who sold them to me, but that certainly doesn&apos;t make me guilty of slave trading.</string>
  <string id="77739" soundid="112888">I can honestly say I had never met or heard of the man until he was arrested. He&apos;s obviously not wealthy enough to be one of my clients.</string>
  <string id="77740" soundid="112889">Apparently, he spends a good deal of time with the poorer folk in the city. No doubt that&apos;s why he is under suspicion.</string>
  <string id="77741" soundid="112890">Doesn&apos;t strike you as a bit odd? A scholar, with all the benefits that position entails, *choosing* to spend time with the poor people. It does seem a little... suspicious.</string>
  <string id="77742" soundid="112891">No more than you&apos;ve heard for yourself, I&apos;m sure. They are a myth, a rumor really. Nobody has ever seen them and nobody has any proof they exist.</string>
  <string id="77743" soundid="112892">And yet, still there is a belief that they exist... madmen terrorizing the poor and abducting the helpless. It all seems very... superstitious.</string>
  <string id="77744" soundid="112893">Abducting a person isn&apos;t like picking someone&apos;s pocket, you know. There would be evidence, signs of a struggle. But people will believe what they want to.</string>
  <string id="77745" soundid="112894">Ah, you&apos;ve returned and, I&apos;m sorry to say, I&apos;m still here. Is there something I can do for you?</string>
  <string id="77746">Why are you so sure I&apos;ll be at risk?</string>
  <string id="77749">I should be going. Goodbye.</string>
  <string id="77750">Tell me about yourself, Chandler Ling.</string>
  <string id="77753">Why were you arrested? What were you doing?</string>
  <string id="77756">How did you acquire those items belonging to Jitong&apos;s men?</string>
  <string id="77759">What do you know about Scholar Songtao?</string>
  <string id="77762">What can you tell me about the slave traders?</string>
  <string id="77765">No, thanks. I should be going. Goodbye.</string>
  <string id="77766" soundid="112915">Good day, miss. Are... you the new investigator I sent for?</string>
  <string id="77767" soundid="112916">Good day, sir. Are... you the new investigator I sent for?</string>
  <string id="77768" soundid="156887"></string>
  <string id="77770" soundid="162119">No, I cannot. Master Smiling Hawk told us you are no longer a member of the school, and that we are forbidden from sparring with you.</string>
  <string id="77771" soundid="112920">No, I can tell from your attire that you&apos;re not from the ministry. (sigh) This is terrible.</string>
  <string id="77772" soundid="112921">Everyone I send for disappears. There are powers at work here that are beyond my means to control.</string>
  <string id="77773" soundid="112922">Please, please just hear my cause. I promise I will not detain you long.</string>
  <string id="77774" soundid="112923">I am Prefect Jitong. It&apos;s my duty to ensure that convicted criminals in the city are sentenced appropriately. But there are... complications with my current trial.</string>
  <string id="77775" soundid="112924">I have in my custody a suspected slave trader, Chandler Ling, but one of the high ranking ministers is trying to get him released, and he wants me to convict another man.</string>
  <string id="77776" soundid="112925">The man they want to accuse, Scholar Songtao, is a friend of mine... and I&apos;m certain of his innocence. I need you to find proof so I can present it to the Minister of Justice.</string>
  <string id="77777" soundid="112926">Really? You will help me? Thank you... thank you so very much. I need to find proof that Ling is the guilty one, and by so doing, exonerate Songtao.</string>
  <string id="77778" soundid="112927">So... you&apos;ll help me? That&apos;s... wonderful. All I need really, is proof. Proof that Ling is indeed involved with the slave traders.</string>
  <string id="77779" soundid="112928">If I can&apos;t prove Ling&apos;s guilt, I&apos;ll be forced to sentence Songtao... to death. But every time I ask someone to discover the truth, they disappear, or turn up dead.</string>
  <string id="77780" soundid="112929">Our best lead is Zi Bao, the last person known to have spoken with Ling before his arrest. But Bao knows me and my men; he won&apos;t talk to us.</string>
  <string id="77785" soundid="112934">I&apos;ve know Scholar Songtao for several years. His uncle and my father were good friends. I only wish I knew why the governor wants him accused of this crime.</string>
  <string id="77787">Winnings Purse</string>
  <string id="77788" soundid="112937">If you want to know more about Songtao, you should speak with him yourself.</string>
  <string id="77789" soundid="112938">Chandler Ling is a well-respected business man and merchant here in the city. Until recently, I had no reason to suspect him of any wrongdoing.</string>
  <string id="77790" soundid="112939">When I investigated Ling&apos;s shop, I found a valuable knife that I had purposely entrusted to one of my men. A man who has since disappeared.</string>
  <string id="77791" soundid="112940">Chandler Ling had a knife belonging to a man whose body couldn&apos;t be found. That was all the evidence I required.</string>
  <string id="77792" soundid="151788">Chai Ka: The road will be divided. There is a powerful presence stirring, and her will must be obeyed.</string>
  <string id="77793" soundid="151789">Chai Ka: There will be no interference, but there will be guidance. There is... something you must see.</string>
  <string id="77794" soundid="151790">Perhaps she means the tombs near the heart of the palace?</string>
  <string id="77795" soundid="112944">I have no idea. The two men were seen together before we arrested Ling. But I have no other information about Zi Bao.</string>
  <string id="77796" soundid="112945">He spends most of his time in the Heart of the Empire Tavern, and he doesn&apos;t seem to have dealings with anyone else besides Chandler Ling.</string>
  <string id="77797" soundid="112946">I know if I went to speak with him I would get nowhere, but you could speak to him without raising suspicion.</string>
  <string id="77798" soundid="151791"></string>
  <string id="77799" soundid="112948">I wish there was something concrete I could tell you. They&apos;re like a whisper on the wind, or a shifting shadow. You think you see something, and then there&apos;s nothing.</string>
  <string id="77800">This small satchel is marked to make it identifiable as one of Gambler Daoshen&apos;s winnings purses. It contains the silver he plans to offer to the Guild in return for permission to increase the limits on his wagers.</string>
  <string id="77802" soundid="112951">Whoever is behind the slavers must have a great deal of power. To remain that... invisible is a hard thing to do.</string>
  <string id="77803" soundid="112952">Good... look for him in the Heart of the Empire Tavern, it&apos;s upstairs at the Imperial Arena. Don&apos;t scare him away... if we lose him, we lose our last connection to Ling.</string>
  <string id="77804" soundid="112953">I see... well, there really isn&apos;t anyone else. If you change your mind, please come and see me.</string>
  <string id="77805" soundid="112954">Oh, it&apos;s you again. Have you reconsidered helping me prove Songtao&apos;s innocence?</string>
  <string id="77806" soundid="112955">Hello again. I don&apos;t mean to sound impatient, but have you spoken with Zi Bao yet?</string>
  <string id="77807" soundid="112956">If you think it will help you find out what&apos;s going on, I&apos;ll gladly answer your questions. What do you want to know?</string>
  <string id="77808" soundid="112957">All right. Remember, Zi Bao is in the Heart of the Empire Tavern in the Imperial Arena. I suggest you try and speak with him if you can. Good luck.</string>
  <string id="77810" soundid="112959">There you are. The governor sent Ho Chong, one of his lapdogs, to oversee the trial. I hope you learned something, or I&apos;ll have to proceed with Songtao&apos;s sentencing.</string>
  <string id="77811" soundid="112960">He... took you there. That&apos;s incredible... that&apos;s remarkable. Well, what did you find? Have you discovered evidence that exonerates Scholar Songtao?</string>
  <string id="77812" soundid="112961">Ha! That doesn&apos;t prove a thing. Pieces of paper can be bought and sold just like anything... just like *anyone.*</string>
  <string id="77813" soundid="112962">I&apos;m afraid you&apos;re quite mistaken, Chandler Ling. This proves a great many things, including your guilt. I never suspected the slavers were so well... connected.</string>
  <string id="77814" soundid="112963">Let me see that. Hmm. Well, this certainly looks... interesting. I... ah, suppose Scholar Songtao can go free then.</string>
  <string id="77815" soundid="112964">And you, Chandler Ling, will come with me for sentencing. It will be quick and harsh, I suspect. This sort of thing will not be tolerated in the Empire.</string>
  <string id="77816" soundid="112965">Thank you... thank you for risking yourself to help me. If there is anything I can do to repay you, please ask.</string>
  <string id="77817" soundid="112966">You are too kind. I have no real way to repay you; however, I do have some items you might be interested in.</string>
  <string id="77818" soundid="123432">Good day again. You&apos;ve done a great deal to aid me. If there&apos;s anything I can do for you, just let me know. I&apos;ve got some interesting items, if you&apos;d like to see them.</string>
  <string id="77819" soundid="123433"></string>
  <string id="77820" soundid="112969">I... don&apos;t really have that much in the way of silver. I give most of it to the poor. I do, however, have several items you may find interesting.</string>
  <string id="77823" soundid="112972">It&apos;s a lie! I have never worked with the slave traders. I don&apos;t even know who the slave traders are. Please... Jitong, you must believe me.</string>
  <string id="77824" soundid="112973">If I weren&apos;t looking at it with my own eyes, I wouldn&apos;t believe it. I&apos;m sorry, Songtao, but with this evidence... there is nothing I can do to help you.</string>
  <string id="77825" soundid="112974">Are you absolutely sure this evidence is valid? Are you sure that Songtao is guilty?</string>
  <string id="77826" soundid="112975">So Chandler Ling is free to go. The governor will be pleased to hear it.</string>
  <string id="77827" soundid="112976">Songtao, you will come with me. Your sentencing will be quick and harsh. This sort of thing cannot be tolerated in the Empire.</string>
  <string id="77828" soundid="112977">I am truly sorry, Songtao. I will go to the governor and throw myself at his mercy, though I&apos;m afraid it will do little good now.</string>
  <string id="77829" soundid="112978">Well, you have certainly done me a great service, though I suspect Cao Zeng had something to do with it as well.</string>
  <string id="77830" soundid="112979">Hello there, and thanks again for all your help. Scholar Songtao and I owe you a great debt of gratitude.</string>
  <string id="77840">Who are you?</string>
  <string id="77841">What are you talking about?</string>
  <string id="77842">I don&apos;t have time for your problems.</string>
  <string id="77846">I&apos;ll do it; I can&apos;t stand to see an innocent man accused.</string>
  <string id="77848">All right... where should I start?</string>
  <string id="77855">I want to know more about Scholar Songtao.</string>
  <string id="77859">Tell me about Chandler Ling.</string>
  <string id="77862" soundid="151792">Whatever we are doing, we have to do it now!</string>
  <string id="77863" soundid="151793">This is going to be a mess, I know it is.</string>
  <string id="77864" soundid="151794"></string>
  <string id="77865">What is Zi Bao&apos;s connection to Chandler Ling?</string>
  <string id="77868" soundid="151795">It&apos;s about time!</string>
  <string id="77869">Tell me about the slave traders.</string>
  <string id="77873">I&apos;ll go find Zi Bao then.</string>
  <string id="77874">Find someone else to solve your problem!</string>
  <string id="77875">Actually, I don&apos;t think I want to help.</string>
  <string id="77876">Yes, I have. I&apos;ll help you if I can.</string>
  <string id="77877">Remind me again what the problem is.</string>
  <string id="77878">No. I must be going.</string>
  <string id="77879">No, I haven&apos;t spoken with him yet.</string>
  <string id="77880">I want to ask you some questions.</string>
  <string id="77881">I&apos;m still working on it.</string>
  <string id="77882">I spoke with Zi Bao and he took me to the slavers.</string>
  <string id="77883">Yes, I have; it&apos;s right here. Take a look for yourself.</string>
  <string id="77888">I&apos;m just glad an innocent man didn&apos;t suffer.</string>
  <string id="77890" soundid="123434">Of course. Good fortune to you.</string>
  <string id="77891">You could pay me for my effort.</string>
  <string id="77894">Actually, the evidence proves his guilt. See for yourself.</string>
  <string id="77897">I just found the evidence; it&apos;s up to you to judge.</string>
  <string id="77901" soundid="113050">So, you think you can free me? Prefect Jitong has sent many good men to their deaths trying to free me. I hope you won&apos;t get into similar trouble.</string>
  <string id="77902" soundid="113051">Well, that&apos;s what Jitong fears. I have no reason to doubt him. Besides, why else would the men not return, and their belongings suddenly appear on the market?</string>
  <string id="77903" soundid="113052">Pure coincidence. It&apos;s not proof; it&apos;s purely circumstantial. Anyone will tell you that.</string>
  <string id="77904" soundid="113053">At any rate, it seems likely that&apos;s what has happened to the men. I feel terrible for them, but I have my own problems to deal with... as you can see.</string>
  <string id="77905" soundid="113054">I understand. If there is anything that might help you find the slave traders, I will gladly tell you. Please don&apos;t give up until you&apos;ve found them.</string>
  <string id="77906" soundid="113055">I... am a scholar, though still a junior scholar by most regards. I assist the philosophers and scholars with their work.</string>
  <string id="77907" soundid="113056">It&apos;s a good life, though I can&apos;t help feeling... guilty, sometimes. The scholars and philosophers have many privileges, while so many live with so little.</string>
  <string id="77908" soundid="113057">I spend my spare time in the poor quarters, helping where I can. If I have any extra money, I use it to help the people there. It&apos;s not much, but I like to think it helps.</string>
  <string id="77909" soundid="113058">I don&apos;t know. I was just down in the poor quarters, helping a family with some repairs on their hut. I was leaving their house when the guards came for me.</string>
  <string id="77910" soundid="113059">They told me I was suspected of abducting people from the poor quarters. I told them it was ridiculous, that I only wanted to help the poor, but they didn&apos;t listen.</string>
  <string id="77911" soundid="113060">I admit I spend time in the poor quarters, but I don&apos;t try to hide it. I&apos;m there several times a week in fact, usually in plain sight of everyone.</string>
  <string id="77912" soundid="113061">Well... nothing really. I&apos;d never heard of him before this. I&apos;ve heard what Jitong said about him, but that&apos;s about it. He seems... decent enough, I suppose.</string>
  <string id="77913" soundid="113062">Nothing! I&apos;ve heard rumors in the past few months. The residents in the poor areas were getting worried, though I never knew anyone who disappeared.</string>
  <string id="77914" soundid="113063">One of the girls I helped out in the poor area said her uncle had disappeared, but I never met him. She was devastated of course, and she blamed the slavers.</string>
  <string id="77915" soundid="113064">But it was all just speculation. No one had ever seen anyone being abducted, there wasn&apos;t even evidence of struggles or violence. I don&apos;t know what else to tell you.</string>
  <string id="77916" soundid="113065">Hello again. Is there something else I can tell you that might help you find the slave traders?</string>
  <string id="77917">How do you know they are dead?</string>
  <string id="77920">I must be going. Goodbye.</string>
  <string id="77921">Tell me about yourself, Scholar Songtao.</string>
  <string id="77924">Why were you arrested? What were you doing?</string>
  <string id="77927">Tell me what you know about Chandler Ling.</string>
  <string id="77928">What do you know about the slave traders?</string>
  <string id="77931">No, I should be going.</string>
  <string id="77936">[temp string]</string>
  <string id="77943">Die, worm!</string>
  <string id="77998" soundid="140427">F... forgive me. I saw a new face and hoped there was kindness there. I was mistaken.</string>
  <string id="77999" soundid="140428">I am a criminal, I suppose. For lightening a few purses I was sentenced to work on the Wall, but I was delivered here instead.</string>
  <string id="78001">If you were strong, you could have survived.</string>
  <string id="78074" soundid="124240">Like what?</string>
  <string id="78075" soundid="124241">They come from across the Empire. Some are brought from the south, some from the poor quarters of the city. Others are those who have merely spoken ill of us.</string>
  <string id="78076" soundid="124242">Their lives before don&apos;t matter. Only their deaths concern us.</string>
  <string id="78077" soundid="124243">Death&apos;s Hand is our lord and master. He holds our souls in bondage and grants us power through it. We obey him unquestioningly. He is the will of the Emperor.</string>
  <string id="78078" soundid="124244">Inquisitor Jia is second only to Death&apos;s Hand himself. She is in charge of our work here, and she oversees our operations in the Imperial City.</string>
  <string id="78079">I need to talk to you about Gambler Daoshen.</string>
  <string id="78082">I have the five hundred silver right here.</string>
  <string id="78083">What if I told you I had won this entire purse of silver off of one roll?</string>
  <string id="78085">I didn&apos;t win that purse. It&apos;s his payment.</string>
  <string id="78087">He&apos;s obviously ignoring your limits and rules. Shut him down.</string>
  <string id="78088">I hope you mean to kill him slowly for defying your control like this.</string>
  <string id="78091">I&apos;m not here to make his payment.</string>
  <string id="78092" soundid="113519">The Guild shut me down! Didn&apos;t you pay them?</string>
  <string id="78093" soundid="113520">A misunderstanding? I cultivated my relationship with the Guild for years, and you tell me this was a *misunderstanding?*</string>
  <string id="78094" soundid="113521">Either a fool or you hold some imagined grudge against my family. Either way I am ruined!</string>
  <string id="78095" soundid="113522">You lie! I spent years securing my position here, and now some crooked dicer will move in and milk my good reputation.</string>
  <string id="78096" soundid="113523">But... you lied to them! I&apos;ve always played by the Guild rules! How will I feed my children?</string>
  <string id="78097" soundid="113524">I was a fool to ask for your help. I may as well have asked a Lotus Assassin to carry my message to the Guild.</string>
  <string id="78098" soundid="113525">At least they would have been honest about destroying my life.</string>
  <string id="78099" soundid="113526">I ran an honest game! It was hard enough earning my keep without loading the dice. Is the entertainment I provide worth nothing to you?</string>
  <string id="78100" soundid="113527">You are a monster! I asked for your help and you ruined me!</string>
  <string id="78101" soundid="113528">I can&apos;t dice here in the city. Maybe there&apos;s a corner of the Empire where the Guild&apos;s influence doesn&apos;t reach.</string>
  <string id="78102" soundid="113529">Before you say a thing, I had a visit from one of Sweet Poison Lyn&apos;s contacts.</string>
  <string id="78103" soundid="113530">Fantastic news. I can up the bets! Now you can wager ten or twenty-five silver on each roll! This is perfect, and I have you to thank!</string>
  <string id="78104" soundid="113531">I already gave you the coin to pay Lyn. I thank you for its safe delivery.</string>
  <string id="78105" soundid="113532">Thank you again for paying the fee from your own silver. Here&apos;s your repayment and a little extra for your time.</string>
  <string id="78106" soundid="113533">Go away. I want nothing more to do with petty thieves.</string>
  <string id="78107" soundid="113534">They say you&apos;re in good with the Guild. You&apos;re allowed into the back rooms where Sweet Poison Lyn runs her shop, aren&apos;t you?</string>
  <string id="78108" soundid="113535">I have a favor to ask of you, when you have a moment. My name&apos;s Gambler Daoshen, by the way. </string>
  <string id="78110" soundid="113537">I know you have a brilliant career to attend to here, but I have a favor to ask of you if you can spare a moment.</string>
  <string id="78111" soundid="113538">I was wondering if you&apos;d wander over here to test your luck. It&apos;s hard to resist the rattling call of the dice, isn&apos;t it? Gambler Daoshen&apos;s the name.</string>
  <string id="78112" soundid="113539">I run the straightest dice in the Imperial City. I wouldn&apos;t want to feed my children with tarnished silver, would I?</string>
  <string id="78113" soundid="113540">Good odds and fair play, that&apos;s how I keep them coming back.</string>
  <string id="78114" soundid="113541">You&apos;re not here to play? What did you want to talk to me for, then?</string>
  <string id="78115" soundid="113542">A simple enough game called High Low. You predict how you&apos;ll roll against my toss and double your coin if you&apos;re right.</string>
  <string id="78116" soundid="113543">You&apos;ll catch on easily enough, I&apos;m sure.</string>
  <string id="78117" soundid="113544">You should see Sweet Poison Lyn as soon as you can. I would love to be able to play for higher stakes.</string>
  <string id="78118" soundid="113545">Back to try your luck, I hope?</string>
  <string id="78119" soundid="113546">I trusted you with that silver! It took me a month of scrimping to save it up! </string>
  <string id="78120" soundid="113547">That it was, but I forgive you, if you&apos;ll go see Sweet Poison Lyn soon.</string>
  <string id="78121" soundid="113548">The only lesson I&apos;ve learned is about you. Leave me alone, thief.</string>
  <string id="78122" soundid="113549">That does it! No more dice for you, thief! I will start saving again and then we shall see!</string>
  <string id="78123" soundid="113550">I know you&apos;re allowed to go freely into the back room past Qui&apos;s office. Would you carry a message to someone in there for me?</string>
  <string id="78124" soundid="113551">I&apos;m sorry, I meant no offense.</string>
  <string id="78125" soundid="113552">There&apos;s a merchant in the back named Sweet Poison Lyn. She has connections with the Guild, the real authorities in this place.</string>
  <string id="78126" soundid="113553">I want to expand my operation, but without the Guild&apos;s approval and protection, I can only take very small bets. If I made any larger transactions, they&apos;d be quite upset.</string>
  <string id="78127" soundid="113554">I spoke to some of the lesser Guild members, and there&apos;s a set fee that must be paid to Sweet Poison Lyn.</string>
  <string id="78128" soundid="113555">It took me some time to save up the silver, but I have the fee. I just can&apos;t get back there to talk to Lyn and pay her directly. </string>
  <string id="78129" soundid="113556">If you could go in there and pay her on my behalf, I&apos;d happily repay you.</string>
  <string id="78130" soundid="113557">A richer game with higher bets, of course. I&apos;m sorry I can&apos;t offer you more, but you must admit this is a small favor.</string>
  <string id="78131" soundid="113558">My thanks. I&apos;m sure Sweet Poison Lyn knows about my interest. I&apos;ve been angling this deal for a while.</string>
  <string id="78132" soundid="113559">You should run back there now. The sooner you go, the sooner we can up the antes!</string>
  <string id="78133" soundid="113560">I understand where you&apos;re coming from, but look at it from my point of view: my game is established and comfortable. I gain nothing by refusing to repay you.</string>
  <string id="78134" soundid="113561">On the other hand, you have little to lose by running off with my silver. Trust me, I will pay you back if you do me this small favor.</string>
  <string id="78135" soundid="113562">[Success] I suppose there&apos;s some truth to that.</string>
  <string id="78136" soundid="113563">[Success] No! That&apos;s not what... oh, you&apos;re right. Why would you run off with my pittance, anyway?</string>
  <string id="78137" soundid="113564">[Success] A wager on your character, is it? Fair enough! I&apos;ll take it.</string>
  <string id="78138" soundid="113565">Here&apos;s one of my winnings purses with the silver. The marking on it will let her know it&apos;s from me. Please take it to Sweet Poison Lyn as quickly as possible.</string>
  <string id="78139" soundid="113566">[Failure] I&apos;m sorry. If my request is an imposition on your time or your purse, I will find someone else to help me.</string>
  <string id="78140" soundid="113567">A shame. If you change your mind.... Well, how about a game?</string>
  <string id="78141" soundid="113568">I&apos;d love to help you out, but you&apos;ve stripped me as bare as an orchid in a hail storm.</string>
  <string id="78142" soundid="113569">That&apos;s what I was waiting to hear. So, what&apos;ll it be? Will your roll be higher or lower than mine? </string>
  <string id="78143" soundid="113570">High it is. Let&apos;s see how sure you are. How much will you bet?</string>
  <string id="78144" soundid="113571">Aiming under my roll are you? I&apos;m happy with that if you are. How confident are you?</string>
  <string id="78145" soundid="113572">Let&apos;s see how they fall, shall we?</string>
  <string id="78146" soundid="113573">You called it right! A high roll doubles your wager.</string>
  <string id="78147" soundid="113574">Rolling low and winning large! You called it well.</string>
  <string id="78148" soundid="113575">Even! House takes the pot on an even bust, my friend.</string>
  <string id="78149" soundid="113576">Not enough spin on the wrist to best my roll, it seems. Don&apos;t worry, you&apos;ll make it back on the next round.</string>
  <string id="78150" soundid="113577">You called low but rolled high. Oh well, there&apos;s always next round!</string>
  <string id="78151" soundid="113578">Well, this is a pickled egg! That&apos;s quite the streak of luck you have there. You&apos;ve cleaned me out.</string>
  <string id="78152" soundid="113579">I&apos;ll have to call the game off for a bit until I can come up with more silver to cover my bets. Congratulations, you&apos;ve beat the house!</string>
  <string id="78153" soundid="113580">What say we try again?</string>
  <string id="78154">Not hurt?</string>
  <string id="78155" soundid="113582">Well, suit yourself. If you change your mind, I&apos;m always ready to roll.</string>
  <string id="78156" soundid="113583">The rules are easier than the lonely daughter of an outskirts farmer, my friend.</string>
  <string id="78157" soundid="113584">The rules are simpler to deduce than the motives of a desperate lad memorizing sappy poetry.</string>
  <string id="78158" soundid="113585">You make a simple prediction of &quot;High&quot; or &quot;Low.&quot; Then we roll. I throw first and you throw second. If you wagered high and roll above me, you double your wager.</string>
  <string id="78159" soundid="113586">If you wagered low and roll below me, you also win. If we roll the same, the house takes all.</string>
  <string id="78160" soundid="113587">Thanks to your help, I can take bets of ten or twenty-five silver. I expect the Guild likes the work I&apos;m doing at those rates.</string>
  <string id="78161" soundid="113588">I can take bets of one and five silver. Nothing extravagant, I know, but Gambler Daoshen plays by the rules.</string>
  <string id="78162" soundid="113589">Well, now, that goes back to the little favor I was hoping to ask of you.</string>
  <string id="78163" soundid="113590">The kind of rules you ignore only if you&apos;re tired of using your arms. I could probably find a way around them if I knew someone who could go into the back room, past Qui&apos;s office.</string>
  <string id="78164" soundid="113591">You&apos;re one of the fighters, aren&apos;t you? If you&apos;re ever allowed back there, come see me, and we&apos;ll talk.</string>
  <string id="78165" soundid="113592">I think they only let arena folk go back there. Fighters in some of the higher divisions.</string>
  <string id="78166" soundid="113593">High Low is easy to learn, and people like it. Why change?</string>
  <string id="78167" soundid="113594">Right you are. Educated as an ancient scholar, I hope?</string>
  <string id="78168" soundid="113595">Thanks again for all your help. Be seeing you around, I hope.</string>
  <string id="78169" soundid="113596">You take care of yourself, and come back soon to the best game in the city.</string>
  <string id="78170">There was a misunderstanding about the fee.</string>
  <string id="78173">I have no idea what happened.</string>
  <string id="78175">The money you gave me convinced them you were over your limit.</string>
  <string id="78176">I told them you offered to let me play outside your limit.</string>
  <string id="78177">That&apos;s not my problem. Tell someone who cares.</string>
  <string id="78180">Find some real employment and *earn* your way.</string>
  <string id="78182">Sell your children into slavery. Their master is required by law to feed them.</string>
  <string id="78190">What&apos;s the nature of the game?</string>
  <string id="78191">I&apos;m not really interested in gambling.</string>
  <string id="78192">Enough of the patter. I&apos;m here for information only.</string>
  <string id="78193">I might be able to play a round. What&apos;s the game?</string>
  <string id="78195">I&apos;m not here to play games. I should go.</string>
  <string id="78196">I&apos;ve decided to keep your silver for myself.</string>
  <string id="78197">My apologies. That was a tasteless joke.</string>
  <string id="78198">This should teach you a lesson about trusting strangers.</string>
  <string id="78199">Ask someone who cares.</string>
  <string id="78200">What&apos;s this favor you need me to do?</string>
  <string id="78201">That sounds easy enough, I&apos;d be happy to help.</string>
  <string id="78202">What message do you need me to carry?</string>
  <string id="78203">I&apos;m no one&apos;s serving girl. Don&apos;t waste my time.</string>
  <string id="78204">I&apos;m no one&apos;s messenger boy. Don&apos;t waste my time.</string>
  <string id="78205">Tell me what you wanted, just make it fast.</string>
  <string id="78207">What would it take to get their protection?</string>
  <string id="78208">I assume their approval has a price.</string>
  <string id="78211">How would I benefit from helping you?</string>
  <string id="78212">I&apos;d be happy to help. I&apos;ll go talk to her.</string>
  <string id="78214">I&apos;m not paying for you. Give me the money and I&apos;ll take it to her.</string>
  <string id="78216">[Charm] You trusted me enough to ask for my help. You can trust me with your silver.</string>
  <string id="78218">[Intimidation] You ask my help, then question my honor? I am no thief!</string>

  <string id="78224">Let&apos;s roll the dice, I&apos;d like to try my luck.</string>
  <string id="78226">I bet I&apos;ll roll higher than you. </string>
  <string id="78227">Lower. I&apos;m betting I&apos;ll be under your roll.</string>
  <string id="78228">I&apos;ll wager ten silver.</string>
  <string id="78229">I&apos;ll put twenty-five coins down on this roll.</string>
  <string id="78230">I&apos;ll wager one silver.</string>
  <string id="78231">Let&apos;s go with five silver for my wager.</string>
  <string id="78233" soundid="157151">I&apos;ve never seen anything like that! I... I&apos;m going to have to change my shirt.</string>
  <string id="78236">Let&apos;s play again.</string>
  <string id="78237">Crush you!</string>
  <string id="78238">On second thought, I don&apos;t want to bet right now.</string>
  <string id="78239">Explain the rules for me.</string>
  <string id="78243">What kind of bets do you take?</string>
  <string id="78244">What rules stop you from taking larger bets?</string>
  <string id="78246">Do you run any other games?</string>
  <string id="78247">That&apos;s all I wanted to know about the rules.</string>
  <string id="78248">That&apos;s enough for now. I should go.</string>
  <string id="78249" soundid="113676">I dropped you off at the pirate camp, you killed some pirates, I got drunk, you killed more pirates, and I took a nap! We are an unstoppable team, my friend!</string>

  <string id="79147" soundid="157008">You&apos;ll want to be careful in there. To get there, head to the western edge of this district. There&apos;s a footbridge that leads to the Necropolis gates.</string>
  <string id="79148" soundid="157009">Somewhat hard to miss, as it&apos;s cut right into the rock with three statues around it.</string>
  <string id="79149" soundid="157010">A pleasure. Anything else?</string>
  <string id="79150" soundid="157011">To reach the Necropolis, you need to go to the Golden Way first. Once there, you can ask another guard, if you&apos;re still lost.</string>
  <string id="79151" soundid="157012">Fair enough. What else can I do for you?</string>
  <string id="79152" soundid="157013">I&apos;m afraid not. I&apos;m on duty, and it&apos;s imperative that I remain focused on what few tasks I&apos;m still deemed capable of performing.</string>
  <string id="79153" soundid="157014">A fellow guard once paused for idle chit-chat with a woman. She went to the Lotus Assassins with a story of his inattentiveness.</string>
  <string id="79154" soundid="157015">Next thing you know, he&apos;s arrested for threatening the security of the Empire with his lax ways. I don&apos;t know what happened to him, but I don&apos;t want to share his fate.</string>
  <string id="79155" soundid="157016">Be about your business, and stay out of trouble. Pleasure to be of service.</string>
  <string id="79156" soundid="157017">It&apos;s the honorable Lotus Assassins, you see. They feel that those of us dedicated to the Imperial Army are nothing more than louts to be ordered about.</string>
  <string id="79157" soundid="157018">Any member of the army, even city guard, is expected to defer any major disturbances to them. Makes me about as useful as a lamp post.</string>
  <string id="79158" soundid="157019">Seems like the Imperial Army can&apos;t be trusted with even the simplest of tasks these days. The Lotus Assassins have made sure that we&apos;re pushed aside.</string>
  <string id="79159" soundid="157020">If you find yourself needing directions, I or any of the other guards will be happy to help. We have to do something to pass the time.</string>
  <string id="79160" soundid="157021">Lost, citizen?</string>
  <string id="79164" soundid="135865">My manners desert me. I am Lord Yun, owner of this land and charged by the Emperor himself to keep it safe.</string>
  <string id="79165" soundid="135866">You should turn back south to Tien&apos;s Landing. This is the safest part of the Great Southern Forest, and even it is polluted with these strange ghosts.</string>
  <string id="79166" soundid="135867">I suppose no one knows this land better than I. Very well, what did you need to know?</string>
  <string id="79170" soundid="157022">This area is known as the Market District. Predictably, plenty of merchants set up their shops around here, and it&apos;s usually bustling.</string>
  <string id="79171" soundid="157023">On the north side of the district is the Imperial Arena. The Heart of the Empire Tavern in the upper level is a nice place to relax.</string>
  <string id="79172" soundid="157024">What else? Oh, yes, there&apos;s the Black Leopard School up the hill on the south side. Lots of skilled warriors get their start there.</string>
  <string id="79173" soundid="157025">This district? Well, it&apos;s called the Golden Way for a variety of reasons. Certainly one of the richer areas of the city, and one of the best looking, as well.</string>
  <string id="79174" soundid="157026">This district is a major thoroughfare, with the Scholars&apos; Garden at one end and the Market District at the other.</string>
  <string id="79175" soundid="157027">There&apos;s also the Necropolis, but most people avoid that place. Who wants to spend time with the dead?</string>
  <string id="79176" soundid="157028">The Scholars&apos; Garden is a quiet place.... Quiet until a pair of the scholars break out into debate, that is.</string>
  <string id="79177" soundid="157029">Certainly a lot of... knowledge being thrown around this place. I&apos;ll let you decide for yourself how much of it is worthwhile.</string>
  <string id="79179">Pirate</string>
  <string id="79182" soundid="157034">What district are you looking for?</string>
  <string id="79183" soundid="157035">The Market District&apos;s easy enough to find. Just head to the west end of the Golden Way and then turn north and go through the large gate.</string>
  <string id="79184" soundid="157036">From here, you need to head to the Golden Way to get to the Market District. So you don&apos;t get turned around, head there and, if you&apos;re still lost, ask another guard.</string>
  <string id="79185" soundid="157037">The Golden Way is through a gate in the southeast corner of this district. Just up a broad flight of steps that lead up from a courtyard.</string>
  <string id="79186" soundid="157038">To reach the Golden Way from here, go through these gates here. They lead west right into the Golden Way.</string>
  <string id="79187" soundid="157039">To reach the Golden Way, go into the pavilion on the north side of the garden and make your way through the rooms of illumination.</string>
  <string id="79188" soundid="157040">When you reach the large wooden pavilion, exit its west side and proceed down the hill to the south.</string>
  <string id="79189">You&apos;ll only help me with minor things?</string>
  <string id="79190">I do have some questions for you.</string>
  <string id="79192">I don&apos;t need any directions.</string>
  <string id="79193">Can you tell me anything other than directions?</string>
  <string id="79196">Goodbye.</string>
  <string id="79202">No, I&apos;m fine. I should go.</string>
  <string id="79204">What can you tell me about this area of the city?</string>
  <string id="79210">Pirate</string>
  <string id="79222">I need help finding my way.</string>
  <string id="79223">How would I reach the Market District?</string>
  <string id="79232">Where would I find the Golden Way?</string>
  <string id="79234">I&apos;m looking for the Scholars&apos; Garden.</string>
  <string id="79237">Where is the Necropolis?</string>
  <string id="79239">That&apos;s all the directions I need. Thank you.</string>

  <string id="79287">PC lets Aishi fight Sen</string>
  <string id="79290">Aishi the Mournful Blade had her revenge on Captain Sen for a crime committed long ago. She refused to just walk away, and you emerged the victor from her attack. With any luck, she has found some peace at last.</string>

  <string id="79773" soundid="117948">And if that wasn&apos;t bad enough, we have the pirates to worry about, too. They&apos;ve been raiding the countryside, taking prisoners to sell into slavery.</string>
  <string id="79774" soundid="117949">The dam was built nearly twenty years ago, causing the river to rise. Now, the dam is open, and the river has fallen so low no ships can navigate it.</string>
  <string id="79775" soundid="117950">Tien&apos;s Landing cannot survive without the river, but nobody in the town dares to go into the ruins to close the dam. The ruins are haunted with the spirits of the dead!</string>
  <string id="79776" soundid="117951">It&apos;s bad luck to speak of such things! Old Wei in the town might tell you more; he&apos;s too old to care about ghosts and curses. But I have enough bad luck already.</string>
  <string id="79777" soundid="117952">A generous offer, great one, but the gate leading to the ruins is locked. If you want to close the dam, you&apos;ll have to get the key from Minister Sheng.</string>
  <string id="79778" soundid="117953">I&apos;m sure he&apos;d be glad to give you a key to the gate. Nobody else will risk going into the ruins because of the ghosts.</string>
  <string id="79779" soundid="117954">There&apos;s a road off to the right just beyond this teahouse. Keep following it up until you reach the town square. Minister Sheng is usually there.</string>
  <string id="79780" soundid="117955">I wish I could help you, great one. But I am only a humble peasant woman. All I know about pirates is to try and avoid them.</string>
  <string id="79781" soundid="117956">Maybe Sheng knows more. I&apos;m sure he&apos;d do all he could to help you get rid of the pirates threatening the town. After all, he is our Imperial Minister.</string>
  <string id="79782">Never mind. I want to ask you something else.</string>
  <string id="79784">I want to ask you something else.</string>
  <string id="79785">I want to know more about the dam.</string>
  <string id="79787">Haunted ruins? Tell me more.</string>
  <string id="79788">Maybe I can close the dam for you.</string>
  <string id="79790">How do I find Minister Sheng?</string>
  <string id="79791">I have more questions for you.</string>
  <string id="79792">I have questions about the pirates.</string>

  <string id="80501">I am rarely beaten, friend.</string>
  <string id="80502" soundid="118960">I&apos;m sure the others agree that my tastes are balanced. The Minister, however, is easily engaged by sympathetic pleas, as are Scholars Zou and Gu.</string>
  <string id="80503" soundid="118961">I find their appreciation of such fawning to be distasteful, but that is one of the arguments they prefer.</string>
  <string id="80504" soundid="118962">I don&apos;t dislike him. I find some of his points to be worth discussing, but Sir Roderick is... a bit disruptive for the garden.</string>
  <string id="80505" soundid="118963">He may bring attention that we do not want. It would be best to peacefully encourage him to be on his way.</string>
  <string id="80506" soundid="118964">The debate was a terrible defeat. If you won&apos;t face the Outlander in combat, what victory can we claim?</string>
  <string id="80508">Why do you dislike the Outlander?</string>
  <string id="80510" soundid="118968">I... I haven&apos;t given it much thought. I pictured myself as balanced, but some of the others are very specific in their tastes.</string>
  <string id="80511" soundid="118969">Actually, you can sway Scholars Cai and Gu by mocking your opponent. I don&apos;t care for it, but they seem to respond quite vigorously.</string>
  <string id="80512" soundid="118970">He is coarser than the thinkers I am used to, but on the whole I am not as upset by him as others appear to be.</string>
  <string id="80513" soundid="118971">He seems bent on disruptive behavior. He should be encouraged to take that elsewhere.</string>
  <string id="80514" soundid="118972">It is unfortunate that you could not defeat the Outlander in the debate. What recourse do we have now?</string>
  <string id="80516">Do you share the Minister&apos;s dislike of the Outlander?</string>
  <string id="80518" soundid="118979">I don&apos;t care where he came from. Anything to get him on his way.</string>
  <string id="80519" soundid="118980">Your failure in the debate was abysmal. What will you do to recover your honor?</string>
  <string id="80521">Do you share the Minister&apos;s disdain for the Outlander?</string>
  <string id="80523" soundid="118985">Scholars Zou and Cai are easy to predict. Dismissing a weak argument gets their attention immediately and will spur them one way or another.</string>
  <string id="80524" soundid="118986">He doesn&apos;t seem that interested in gathering any. He is clearly used to imposing his opinion, regardless of the recipients&apos; desire to have it.</string>
  <string id="80525" soundid="118987">His points are debatable, but his presentation is not compatible with the garden.</string>
  <string id="80526" soundid="118988">This was a troubling affair. Is there nothing we can do now about this Outlander?</string>
  <string id="80528">The Outlander has very few supporters.</string>
  <string id="80530" soundid="118993">I will take my leave. Remember, however, that while I may have succumbed to your fists, my mind bested yours in no uncertain terms.</string>
  <string id="80533" soundid="151796">Trust her voice. We need a path through Master Li&apos;s corruption.</string>
  <string id="80675" soundid="119144">The Minister is not the best at... applied intelligence. Many of the scholars are theoretically smart.</string>
  <string id="80676" soundid="119145">The Minister had me insult thirty-four people. The best answer before yours was a smart slap in the face.</string>
  <string id="80677" soundid="119146">I am supposed to be the servant of an educated man. Destiny is a trickster that does not share the joke.</string>
  <string id="80678" soundid="119147">I like this Outlander. His foolishness is not disguised behind education.</string>
  <string id="80679" soundid="119148">The Minister is not the most aware of what he says.</string>
  <string id="80680" soundid="119149">Such a string of improprieties. Spirits have tricked his mouth into mocking him.</string>
  <string id="80681" soundid="119150">He may not know he is the center of a joke, but that does not decrease my enjoyment.</string>
  <string id="80682" soundid="119151">Your actions must have brought too much sense to the world. The Minister seems to be charged with returning balance.</string>
  <string id="80683" soundid="119152">A shame you had to send the Outlander on his way. I welcome anything that shakes up these bookworms.</string>
  <string id="80684" soundid="119153">I almost wish the Outlander had won. Everyone is back to thinking about how important they are.</string>

  <string id="80692" soundid="119182">I&apos;m sorry, I&apos;ve ruined the mood. We should continue our talk another time. First, we must expose Death&apos;s Hand, reveal his treachery and manipulation. </string>
  <string id="80693" soundid="119183">Generosity is a part of my character from time to time as well. It is more than most men will show for you.</string>
  <string id="80694" soundid="119184">The Imperial Palace holds many treasures... although Death&apos;s Hand carted many off, to what end I do not know.</string>
  <string id="80695" soundid="119185">Well, perhaps it would be best if we restricted this relationship to business. There is a limit to my patience and I will end this before I reach that limit.</string>
  <string id="80696" soundid="119186">I thank you for your courtesy. One always likes to hear when one&apos;s gifts are appreciated.</string>
  <string id="80697" soundid="119187">Can I not simply want to give you something? Does my noble birth not give me the same right as any other to... to show favor?</string>
  <string id="80698" soundid="119188">You rebuff my attempt at friendship? I am a daughter of the Emperor himself. It would be wise of you not to draw my ire. Civility is prized in the Imperial City.</string>
  <string id="80699" soundid="119189">But I understand the strains and pressures that you have been under. I am willing to forgive your impertinence this once.</string>
  <string id="80700" soundid="119190">After the... disappearance of my uncle, Sun Kin the Hand of Heaven, the Imperial Order of the Lotus Monks was directionless.</string>
  <string id="80701" soundid="119191">Instead of taking on that role himself, my father gave it to an advisor: Death&apos;s Hand. I was only a baby at the time.</string>
  <string id="80702" soundid="119192">He did not have enough time. The burden of state is heavy and he is not a well man. Death&apos;s Hand takes advantage of this.</string>
  <string id="80703" soundid="119193">Regardless, the Lotus Monks were placed in the care of Death&apos;s Hand, a duty reserved for royalty. It was almost as if my father took Death&apos;s Hand into our family! My family!</string>
  <string id="80704" soundid="119194">We have been caretakers of the Empire for generations. We have created a bastion of culture in an otherwise uncivilized world. Death&apos;s Hand threatens all of this.</string>

  <string id="80706" soundid="119196">About... about me? But... why?</string>
  <string id="80707" soundid="119197">I mean, there&apos;s so much I&apos;ve told you already, I really don&apos;t think that we need any more information to complete our mission.</string>
  <string id="80708" soundid="119198">Oh... well, I suppose I could answer a few  questions.</string>
  <string id="80709" soundid="119199">Although I&apos;m sure more than enough has been said about me by the peasants or others. I am quite used to defending myself from all quarters.</string>
  <string id="80710" soundid="119200">Am I really that way? Perhaps I appear to be, but only because I have no other way to fight what is happening. I care deeply about the traditions of this land.</string>
  <string id="80711" soundid="119201">It pains me to go against what I try to protect. What other choice do I have? I hope the people speak of other things... how I try to make things right.</string>
  <string id="80712" soundid="119202">You presume a great deal. Can you really have seen this in such a short time?</string>
  <string id="80713" soundid="119203">Those are qualities I would like to say I have, but I am not certain that I do. I have little time for listening when I seem to be fighting the very system of which I am a part.</string>
  <string id="80714" soundid="119204">You... well, you might. I don&apos;t know what the future will bring for us.</string>
  <string id="80715" soundid="119205">Do you think yourself worthy of reminding me of what is important? To keep me humble? My father will take a dim view of that.</string>
  <string id="80716" soundid="119206">My father, the Emperor, is the heart and soul of this Empire. He is the one who can restore your master to you. You must respect him.</string>
  <string id="80717" soundid="119207">He should be of great concern to you, if only because he is of concern to me.</string>
  <string id="80718" soundid="119208">Ha! Your ambition knows no bounds, but the Empire is no stranger to your kind. We have dealt with many like you.</string>
  <string id="80719" soundid="119209">Of course, it appears that we have also nearly fallen to one. I will stand with you against Death&apos;s Hand, but remember our purpose. I will see my father restored.</string>
  <string id="80720" soundid="119210">I think we&apos;ve talked enough for now. I have enjoyed this. Perhaps we can continue later.</string>
  <string id="80721" soundid="119211">That is not true. Without the support of the people, an Emperor... or Empress... has nothing. My father has forgotten this in the spell Death&apos;s Hand has woven.</string>
  <string id="80722" soundid="119212">So the burden is left for me to bear. I don&apos;t know if I can overcome all that fate will put in my way.</string>
  <string id="80723" soundid="119213">Ha! Strong words, indeed! I never pictured myself as a harsh ruler, but I certainly try to maintain the virtue of justice. Is that how I present myself to you?</string>
  <string id="80724" soundid="119214">I do know what I want, but getting it is something else. Sometimes, I think you know what I mean, and others... I don&apos;t know myself.</string>
  <string id="80725" soundid="119215">Wait... this is further than I thought this conversation would go. This is not proper... I will not allow it. You presume too much.</string>
  <string id="80726" soundid="119216">I think we have had quite enough amusement for now. Perhaps... perhaps we will continue this a little later. I have enjoyed our little... talk.</string>
  <string id="80727" soundid="119217">You are very unlike the women of the court I grew up with. I have long tried to separate myself from them.</string>
  <string id="80728" soundid="119218">First you stab at me with your words, then twist them around to seek my heart. You are very adept.</string>
  <string id="80729" soundid="119219">So, why dress this revelation in so many previous compliments? If this is your true opinion, I don&apos;t see a need to continue this.</string>
  <string id="80730" soundid="119220">How very superficial, yet... flattering... coming from you.</string>
  <string id="80731" soundid="119221">I suppose peasants tend to focus on certain things, given their short and brutish lives. Something to imagine, some perfection to seek...</string>
  <string id="80732" soundid="119222">And do you agree with them?</string>
  <string id="80733" soundid="119223">Useful. And that is all? If that is the extent of what you want from me, why disguise your intent with your previous words? You are very confusing.</string>
  <string id="80734" soundid="119224">I think it would be best to confine our talks to the task at hand. If you require something, I will help, but this game of yours is too distracting.</string>
  <string id="80735" soundid="119225">That is... not what I was expecting you to say. You are very unlike the women of the court I grew up with. I have long tried to separate myself from them.</string>
  <string id="80736" soundid="119226">As you can tell from my unconventional choice of traveling... companions. I think we are very similar, you and I. You are... interesting.</string>
  <string id="80737" soundid="119227">We will continue this another time. I find myself at a loss for words. Very few people have had such an effect. Yes, you are... interesting.</string>
  <string id="80738" soundid="119228">I have never seen myself as particularly generous, but it would not be so bad to be remembered in that way. The gratitude of the peasants is important to any ruler.</string>
  <string id="80739" soundid="119229">They, even unknowingly, have the power to see the Empire rise or fall. The love of the people is powerful.</string>
  <string id="80740" soundid="119230">I hope, however, that I am not just seen as a giver of charity. Anyone can throw money at the downtrodden. I try to accomplish more than that.</string>
  <string id="80741" soundid="119231">Harsh times demand harsh actions. This is a time of trial for my family and the Empire. One I shall not fail!</string>
  <string id="80742" soundid="119232">I hope they do not only speak of my harshness, despite my position above them. We all want people to speak well of us.</string>
  <string id="80743" soundid="119233">I was at least trying to be civil, but you persist in treating me this way. Very well. Other than the goals we share, there shall be nothing between us.</string>
  <string id="80744" soundid="119234">Now, if there is anything you wish to ask regarding those goals, I shall speak. Otherwise, let&apos;s just get on with it.</string>
  <string id="80745" soundid="119235">I mean, if you were a man, I could understand how there might be some interest but... never mind. Is this about the mission?</string>
  <string id="80746" soundid="119236">I don&apos;t know. I have made... inquiries, but no one had seen or heard of him before he rose to power. He was like a Lotus Assassin even then... hiding in the shadows.</string>
  <string id="80747" soundid="119237">I don&apos;t know. My father said he and my other uncle, Sun Li, were lost in the battle to end the Long Drought, but I can find no record of who or what they fought.</string>
  <string id="80748" soundid="119238">And don&apos;t start your foolishness that your master is the Glorious Strategist. You have no proof of that. He remains a dead man, and possibly a traitor.</string>
  <string id="80749" soundid="119239">Sometimes he refers to them in very unflattering terms. My father may refuse to speak of it for the good of the Empire.</string>
  <string id="80750" soundid="119240">I need your help and will aid you in return, but I don&apos;t need to hear your insults. You will see when all of this is done.</string>
  <string id="80751" soundid="119241">My father will be restored, Death&apos;s Hand will be punished, and you will take your master back to whatever mud hole you crawled from.</string>
  <string id="80752" soundid="119242">I think we are through talking. Onward with business. I will trouble you with nothing else from now on.</string>

  <string id="80784" soundid="126488">Thank you! Thank you so much! I just need to get across this puddle, but I can&apos;t touch the water because... because of how I died.</string>
  <string id="80798" soundid="126233">She is... special. Without her, I could not bridge the gap between your realm and my own. With her as my host, I can manifest myself here.</string>
  <string id="80799" soundid="126234">I have done nothing to her. She has helped give me form, and in return, I protect her.</string>
  <string id="80800" soundid="126235">No, she has no command of magic. She is my anchor in this world.</string>
  <string id="80801">Feel death&apos;s icy breath!</string>
  <string id="80802" soundid="126237">She is an anchor binding me to the mortal realm. I could not exist in your realm without her. I protect Wild Flower from danger, and she allows me to fulfill my duties.</string>
  <string id="80803" soundid="126238">We are separate, but in many ways we are also one. I would explain it better if I could, but as I said, it is difficult to understand.</string>
  <string id="80804" soundid="126239">I do not know. The will of heaven is kept from me. I know only what I am supposed to do.</string>
  <string id="80805" soundid="126240">I knew I was to guard the amulet and the gem. And I was to wait for their rightful owner. Now I know I must help you fulfill your destiny... whatever that may be.</string>
  <string id="80806" soundid="126241">To exist here, I needed an anchor. That is where Wild Flower has helped me. With the ability to influence and manipulate the material realm, I could carry out my task.
</string>
  <string id="80807" soundid="126242">But even with Wild Flower anchoring me to this world, I failed in my mission. Treachery took the amulet from me; now we must recover it to fulfill your destiny.</string>
  <string id="80808" soundid="126243">She... was already here. It was of benefit to both of us that she serve as my host. The will of the heavens dictate, and no mortal or demon can resist them.</string>
  <string id="80809" soundid="126244">I have given you the gem and fulfilled part of my mission, but the Lotus Assassins took the amulet from me. You will need them both to fulfill your destiny.</string>
  <string id="80810" soundid="126245">I was able to kill them all... all but the leader. While I was fighting his followers, he seized the amulet and fled. I could not follow.</string>
  <string id="80811" soundid="126246">My duty bound me here. I had to stay and wait for you. But now that you are here, I am free to leave this place and go with you to reclaim the amulet.</string>
  <string id="80812" soundid="126247">No. He has fled beyond my reach. But I am confident you will find him and reclaim the amulet. It was destined for you, not him.</string>
  <string id="80813" soundid="126248">I cannot follow you in the normal sense. I exist here, within Wild Flower, and can only manifest for short periods. She will accompany you, and through her, so will I.</string>
  <string id="80814">By the honor of my family!</string>
  <string id="80815">I must inflict pain.</string>
  <string id="80816">I tried to tell you, I am not a Lotus Assassin!</string>
  <string id="80817">My name is none of your business!</string>
  <string id="80820">I don&apos;t need another servant.</string>
  <string id="80821">Why shouldn&apos;t I just kill you, monster?</string>
  <string id="80823">I am honored to have you as my companion, Chai Ka.</string>
  <string id="80824">You better make yourself useful.</string>
  <string id="80825">Who was that little girl?</string>
  <string id="80826">So what happens now?</string>
  <string id="80828">What have you done to her, demon?!</string>
  <string id="80830">Is she a sorceress?</string>
  <string id="80832">I don&apos;t understand.</string>
  <string id="80833">I&apos;ll re-educate you.</string>
  <string id="80835">So what is my destiny?</string>
  <string id="80839">How did Wild Flower know to come here?</string>
  <string id="80840" soundid="177520">Most believe Sun Li fell at Dirge... a lie spread by the Emperor. A handful of us knew that he lived, and we also learned the terrible price of his rebellion.</string>
  <string id="80844">Do you know where the thief went?</string>

  <string id="80906">It is a noble&apos;s duty to face hardship. It is the burden you must bear.</string>
  <string id="80908">The power of royalty is the power to command. And your father will not live forever.</string>
  <string id="80912">We cannot allow such a travesty to happen.</string>
  <string id="80915">Your flower would only wither under such harsh conditions.</string>
  <string id="80920">It doesn&apos;t really matter, since I will kill Death&apos;s Hand soon enough.</string>
  <string id="80922">Where did you find it, anyway?</string>
  <string id="80924">Your favor means nothing to me. You are useful so long as you help me.</string>
  <string id="80926">I question your motives. I do not trust you yet.</string>
  <string id="80928">Trinkets from spoiled princesses are useless to me.</string>
  <string id="80931">That annoys you, I can see. Tell me about it.</string>
  <string id="80933">Why didn&apos;t your father take the role for himself?</string>
  <string id="80937">That is your duty, but what about who you are? Tell me about yourself.</string>
  <string id="80939">The princess and her duties interest me less than the woman behind them.</string>
  <string id="80941">What do they say? That she is a hellion? She flies in the face of tradition?</string>
  <string id="80943">I&apos;m sure they say the princess has the authority to command, yet the wisdom to listen to advice.</string>
  <string id="80945">Don&apos;t worry. I&apos;ll keep you grounded.</string>
  <string id="80947">I&apos;ll be wherever you wish me to be.</string>
  <string id="80948">Your father is far from my mind right now.</string>
  <string id="80950">You misunderstand. He is far from my mind because I am enjoying your company.</string>
  <string id="80951">If need be, your father will fall to me.</string>
  <string id="80954">You don&apos;t need to care what other people think.</string>
  <string id="80957">No doubt they say the princess brooks no challenge and tolerates no incompetence.</string>
  <string id="80958">You are a strong woman who knows how to get what she wants.</string>
  <string id="80962">As cold as ice... and as flawless.</string>

  <string id="80969">I think you are very beautiful.</string>
  <string id="80970">I think you will be very useful to me.</string>
  <string id="80974">What do they say? That she would do anything for those in need?</string>
  <string id="80977">I&apos;ll wager that they say she has an iron will and a heart of ice.</string>
  <string id="80979">You&apos;re right... you aren&apos;t that interesting.</string>

  <string id="84239" soundid="122742">I may have heard one or two voices against you during your fight. Perhaps they thought winning the fight only secured the Outlander&apos;s view of us as savages.</string>
  <string id="84245">What are you doing? Why attempt to insult me?</string>
  <string id="84246">I asked for an explanation. Justify yourself or I will take offense.</string>
  <string id="84247">There is no point to your insults. Defend your claims, or cease this instant!</string>
  <string id="84249">Explain yourself.</string>
  <string id="84252">Where did this man come from?</string>
  <string id="84254">If you were behind this, then I owe *you* a beating!</string>
  <string id="84256">That&apos;s it. I will put an end to your pointless heckling!</string>

  <string id="84339" soundid="122904">You&apos;re not the only one. All over town people keep saying to me, &quot;Lishun, why are you so happy? Can&apos;t you see how bad things are?&quot; But it&apos;s just a matter of perspective.</string>
  <string id="84340" soundid="122905">Things will get better. They always do. It&apos;s like my father used to say: The greater the problem, the greater the solution. I&apos;m sure it will all work out.</string>
  <string id="84341" soundid="122906">You came to the right place, then. I won&apos;t give you the doom and gloom others will. Sure, we&apos;ve got problems, but Tien&apos;s Landing is still the best village in the district!</string>
  <string id="84342" soundid="122907">Now, now. &quot;Drunk&quot; is such a harsh word. Perhaps he ingests more wine than most of us, but can you blame him?</string>
  <string id="84343" soundid="122908">This region is known for its remarkable wines; they say a single drop is like the sweet tears of a goddess. It&apos;s a wonder we don&apos;t all drink as much as he does.</string>
  <string id="84344" soundid="122909">Denial? Preposterous. Sure, half the people have moved away, and those who stayed have mostly given up hope. And the entire town is running out of food and silver.</string>
  <string id="84345" soundid="122910">But does my optimism mean I&apos;m in denial? Of course not! I mean, none of the buildings are on fire, right? See? Something good, just like that. Right off the top of my head.</string>
  <string id="84346" soundid="122911">I admit that some see our Imperial Minister Sheng as... well... not entirely competent or capable of dealing with our problems. But somehow things will work out. They always do.</string>
  <string id="84347" soundid="122912">Of course, of course. I will gladly converse on any number of topics. It&apos;s a fine way to pass the time on such a beautiful day!</string>
  <string id="84348" soundid="122913">Before he was Emperor, before there even was an Empire, Sagacious Tien was a young man fond of wandering the countryside. One day he stopped, weary from his travels.</string>
  <string id="84349" soundid="122914">He lay down to rest beneath the shade of a cool tree and had a marvelous dream of a shining empire. This dream drove him to create the Jade Empire as we know it.</string>
  <string id="84350" soundid="122915">Yes, but there *used* to be. Many centuries ago. All evidence of it may be gone now, but just knowing it was here once is all the proof I need.</string>
  <string id="84351" soundid="122916">Other villages try to claim the Emperor had his dream while crossing their lands, but I know the truth. Tien&apos;s Landing--my home town--is the birthplace of the Empire.</string>
  <string id="84352" soundid="122917">Most of the merchants, and our glorious Minister Sheng, gather in the town square, the highest point in the village. Just follow any path that leads up until you reach it.</string>
  <string id="84354">I want to talk about something else.</string>
  <string id="84357">But there is no castle.</string>
  <string id="84362">Glad to see you&apos;re keeping your spirits up.</string>
  <string id="84364">You mean he&apos;s a drunk.</string>
  <string id="84366">I think you&apos;re in denial.</string>
  <string id="84369">He seemed like a pathetic drunk to me.</string>
  <string id="84374" soundid="123248">The artifact is supposed to be in the room at the end of the tomb. Once you&apos;re there, I&apos;ll catch up with you.</string>
  <string id="84375" soundid="123249">There are still ghosts. I can&apos;t get the artifact unless the ghosts are gone.</string>
  <string id="84376" soundid="123250">All right. I&apos;ll wait here until you&apos;ve cleared them all. Good luck.</string>
  <string id="84377" soundid="123251">I... see. Well, please don&apos;t be too long. I need to get that artifact back to Purveyor Shouji soon.</string>
  <string id="84378" soundid="123252">That&apos;s it. I&apos;ve got it. Now let&apos;s get out of here before... what&apos;s that? Did you hear that?</string>
  <string id="84379" soundid="123253">Getting out of here is going to be harder than getting in, I think.</string>
  <string id="84380" soundid="123254">I&apos;m glad you&apos;re looking forward to this. I&apos;m just going to hide in here until it&apos;s all over.</string>
  <string id="84381" soundid="123255">That doesn&apos;t sound like nothing.</string>
  <string id="84382" soundid="123256">I can&apos;t believe we made it out of there alive. You&apos;re an amazing fighter.</string>
  <string id="84383" soundid="123257">I wonder why Purveyor Shouji wants this bowl so badly. It looks so... ordinary, except for maybe this writing.</string>
  <string id="84384" soundid="123258">It doesn&apos;t make any sense. &quot;Conductor, cog, and a bit of iron. Don&apos;t play with the tiger.&quot; Whatever that means.</string>
  <string id="84385" soundid="123259">Huh. Well I&apos;m glad it was useful to you.</string>
  <string id="84386" soundid="123260">I can&apos;t imagine how it could be interesting, but I&apos;m glad you think so.</string>
  <string id="84387" soundid="123261">I... I told you before that I have nothing of value to give you. You can have everything in the tomb.</string>
  <string id="84388" soundid="123262">Thank you again for helping me. Purveyor Shouji is waiting, so I should be going. Goodbye.</string>
  <string id="84389" soundid="123263">What? No! Purveyor Shouji would sell my mom to the slave traders if I give it to you. I have to go now; Shouji is waiting.</string>
  <string id="84390" soundid="123264">Hello again. Purveyor Shouji was so happy to see the artifact that he released me and my mom from our debts. Thank you again for all your help.</string>
  <string id="84391" soundid="123265">Thanks again for all your help. My mom and I are very grateful for all you&apos;ve done.</string>
  <string id="84392" soundid="151797">Trust what you see. Voices can come from anywhere.</string>
  <string id="84393" soundid="151798">She will coerce and belittle. Trust your desire.</string>
  <string id="84394" soundid="123268">I... don&apos;t have anything to give you. My mom and I are very poor, or we wouldn&apos;t be working for Purveyor Shouji.</string>
  <string id="84395" soundid="123269">I overheard Shouji say the artifact was in an old emperor&apos;s tomb. I bet there&apos;s a lot of stuff in there you could take... once I get us inside.</string>
  <string id="84396" soundid="123270">I don&apos;t care about anything but the artifact. Anything else is yours.</string>
  <string id="84397" soundid="123271">I... see. Well, goodbye then.</string>
  <string id="84399">That&apos;s not enough. Forget it.</string>
  <string id="84400">That sounds like a fair deal. Okay, I&apos;ll help you.</string>
  <string id="84401" soundid="151799">Ya Zhen: She is strong here... but I don&apos;t think she means to interfere. Something about... guidance. You will know more inside.</string>
  <string id="84402">I&apos;ve decided to help you after all.</string>
  <string id="84403">Why was that man bothering you before?</string>
  <string id="84406">Stay here until I&apos;ve cleared the ghosts.</string>
  <string id="84408">Don&apos;t worry. I&apos;ll get rid of the ghosts in no time.</string>
  <string id="84409">I&apos;m not worried. I&apos;ve fought tougher things than ghosts.</string>
  <string id="84411">Sorry, I must have got turned around.</string>
  <string id="84412">I must go, but I&apos;ll return shortly.</string>
  <string id="84413">I have to go.</string>
  <string id="84414">Sounds like trouble.</string>
  <string id="84415">A chance for more fighting, if I&apos;m lucky!</string>
  <string id="84416">It&apos;s probably nothing.</string>
  <string id="84419">That might be a configuration I&apos;m looking for.</string>
  <string id="84421">Hmm, interesting.</string>
  <string id="84423">Well, you&apos;ve got your artifact. What do I get?</string>
  <string id="84424">All right. Get going then.</string>
  <string id="84425">Give me the artifact.</string>
  <string id="84427" soundid="151800">Ya Zhen: Urgh... it may not matter who walks through the door. I sense a great power within, and her will cannot be ignored.</string>
  <string id="84428">I&apos;ll go there immediately.</string>
  <string id="84429">I can do it, but it&apos;ll cost you.</string>
  <string id="84449">Boathouse Door</string>
  <string id="84467">Fine. Here&apos;s the evidence. Songtao is guilty after all.</string>
  <string id="84468">Yes, Songtao is obviously guilty.</string>
  <string id="84470">Yes, I want silver and goods!</string>
  <string id="84471">Of course. I don&apos;t work for free!</string>
  <string id="84472" soundid="123435">Is there anything else I can do for you today, my friend?</string>
  <string id="84473">Yes, show me what you&apos;ve got for sale.</string>
  <string id="84474">No thanks. I must be going.</string>
  <string id="84475">Show me your items again.</string>
  <string id="84486" soundid="135868">This region is known as the Great Southern Forest, as I said. The forest stretches for miles to the north, east, and west of here.</string>
  <string id="84487" soundid="135869">This specific area is known as the Pilgrim&apos;s Path. These hills house several small shrines, and a large temple lies at the top of the path that begins with these stairs.</string>
  <string id="84488" soundid="135870">As it stands, this is the only part of the forest that&apos;s even vaguely passable. Coming from the Imperial City, I had no choice but to take a flyer to Tien&apos;s Landing.</string>
  <string id="84490">Gao&apos;s Mercenary</string>
  <string id="84493" soundid="135871">Things have worsened in the past few months, which is roughly the time since the trees of the forest started to look sickly.</string>
  <string id="84494" soundid="135872">Before I flew here from the Imperial City, I heard rumors of more and more ghosts in the outer provinces, but I foolishly thought them exaggeration.</string>
  <string id="84495" soundid="135873">The forest is polluted with ghosts of all types, and they are only growing in number. As you must know, ghosts can only be dispersed, never destroyed completely.</string>
  <string id="84496" soundid="135874">Of the vast expanse of this forest, this area--the Pilgrim&apos;s Path, as it&apos;s called--is the safest.</string>
  <string id="84497" soundid="135875">I hoped that coming here might help me learn why the forest is as it is, but that seems a lost cause.</string>
  <string id="84498" soundid="135876">If things don&apos;t improve soon, I shall have to abandon this camp and fly back to the Imperial City a failure. That would be unfortunate.</string>
  <string id="84541">Local Thug</string>
  <string id="84551" soundid="123520">Hold on a sec. We got company.</string>
  <string id="84552" soundid="123521">You&apos;re a little too interested in our business, friend. Looks like we gotta teach you to back off when Ai Ling&apos;s boys are working.</string>
  <string id="84553" soundid="123522">Yes, you&apos;re right, of course. I suppose I can&apos;t fault Lan for being worried about me. I&apos;ve taken some serious beatings lately.</string>
  <string id="84554" soundid="123523">Sorry, sorry. Forgive me, honorable stranger. I&apos;m not normally so... well, I&apos;m a bit of a wreck right now. I&apos;ve taken some pretty bad beatings these past few days.</string>
  <string id="84555" soundid="123524">She&apos;s obviously crazy. I&apos;ve done nothing to her. We haven&apos;t even spoken in years! If I go to her hideout to talk to her, I&apos;m afraid I&apos;ll never come out.</string>
  <string id="84556" soundid="123525">At least the beatings on the street are out in public. They won&apos;t kill me in front of witnesses. Well, not on purpose, anyway.</string>
  <string id="84557" soundid="123526">No. Lan&apos;s very emotional; I didn&apos;t want her to get upset. At first, I didn&apos;t tell her anything at all. But I couldn&apos;t hide my bruises forever, so I told her about the beatings.</string>
  <string id="84558" soundid="123527">But even then, I didn&apos;t mention Ai Ling. It&apos;s bad enough what&apos;s happening to me. I was afraid if Lan became more involved, Ai Ling might hurt her, too.</string>
  <string id="84559" soundid="123528">I&apos;m being completely honest, I swear! I... I know how this looks. You must think I&apos;ve done something to deserve this. But I have no idea why Ai Ling is after me!</string>
  <string id="84560" soundid="123529">I... I understand. You must have more important things to do than help out a simple baker with his problems. But I have nowhere else to turn.</string>
  <string id="84561" soundid="123530">Please, if you get a chance, go speak with Ai Ling in the boathouse. See if you can get her to leave me alone. Lan and I just want to live our lives in peace.</string>
  <string id="84562">I don&apos;t have time for this.</string>
  <string id="84565">Lan figured you couldn&apos;t handle things on your own.</string>
  <string id="84568">Dawn Star</string>
  <string id="84569">Actually, Lan sent me to help you.</string>
  <string id="84570">She&apos;s just worried about you.</string>
  <string id="84573">So why did those thugs attack you?</string>
  <string id="84575">Have you told any of this to Lan?</string>
  <string id="84577">I get the feeling you&apos;re not telling me something.</string>
  <string id="84626">Never mind. Goodbye.</string>
  <string id="84627" soundid="129033">Now look what you&apos;ve made me do! I&apos;ve collapsed the way out! When I catch you, woman, you will be sorry!</string>
  <string id="84628" soundid="129034">It&apos;s always someone else&apos;s fault, isn&apos;t it, Gao! This is your mess! I didn&apos;t make you kidnap me!</string>
  <string id="84650" soundid="129037">Your friend is doing a good job of frustrating Gao into carelessness. That will work in your favor. But it also means we have to follow them by a different route.</string>
  <string id="84666" soundid="129038">Be careful, that means fresh enemies for us. These caves harbor strange creatures.</string>
  <string id="84764">So you do know each other!</string>
  <string id="84823" soundid="137215">Well, this is certainly foreboding. You really have to work to get this level of menace into a building.</string>
  <string id="84854" soundid="129069">Yes, I&apos;m Spear Catches Leaf, Lord Yun&apos;s lead hunter. I learned a ritual from Lord Yun&apos;s father, and I had hoped to use it to ask the aid of the Forest Shadow.</string>
  <string id="84855" soundid="182898">He is corrupting its nature. Fortunately, you now see that, as a Spirit Monk, essence gems will serve you without it. The amulet is a pathway, not a source of power.</string>
  <string id="84857" soundid="129072">Cannibals? Humans twisted inside by consuming others&apos; flesh? Why would you ask that?</string>
  <string id="84858" soundid="129073">It&apos;s all the more pressing that you try to reach her, then! Cannibals? What could cause men to warp so? I&apos;d almost rather not know.</string>
  <string id="84860" soundid="129074">It is true that spirits can grow fickle. Some become vindictive, punishing men for imagined crimes. The Forest Shadow, though, has been constant for centuries.</string>
  <string id="84873" soundid="129076">Not that I can think of, but I haven&apos;t yet visited the Pilgrim&apos;s Rest. Could they have incurred her wrath? Perhaps you should ask them.</string>
  <string id="84877" soundid="132990">[Spirits go mad if denied passage to the underworld. They are strong, but you can fight them. You can&apos;t kill the dead, but in defeat they are disrupted and can&apos;t reform for a time.]</string>
  <string id="84879">Debating Ground</string>
  <string id="84880" soundid="129081">I&apos;ve set the fires, and the furnaces are ready, but one of the key crystals is missing. Without it, we can&apos;t even see what these furnaces are supposed to do.</string>
  <string id="84899" soundid="129083">I examined the area when I realized that the crystal was gone, and I stumbled across some strange tracks that lead in the direction of the inn.</string>
  <string id="84909" soundid="129085">I don&apos;t know. They looked like bare human feet, but the tracks were closely spaced and bore a strange gait. As if a child made them... A deformed child.</string>
  <string id="84947" soundid="124451">But the fact is, Bei promised to marry me long before that seamstress batted her brazen little eyes at him.</string>
  <string id="84948" soundid="124452">He didn&apos;t even have the decency to tell me himself. Even now he&apos;d rather get beaten up every day than face me... or he sends someone in his place, like you.</string>
  <string id="84949" soundid="124453">I get it. I&apos;m just a thug, right? But Bei promised to marry me, whether he admits it or not. And now he won&apos;t even come here and face me himself. That should tell you something.</string>
  <string id="84950" soundid="124454">I hope things work out for Bei and Lan. After everything I put them through, they deserve it. I don&apos;t know what came over me.</string>
  <string id="84951" soundid="124455">She said there was something I need to know, Bei. What&apos;s going on? What is she talking about?</string>
  <string id="84952" soundid="124456">I was crying, so you took my hand and said, &quot;I think you&apos;re pretty, Ai Ling. And someday, when we&apos;re grown up, I&apos;ll marry you.&quot;</string>
  <string id="84953" soundid="124457">It meant something to me, Bei! You were the only boy who didn&apos;t tease me, the only one I liked. You promised to marry me, and you&apos;re going to keep that promise!</string>
  <string id="84954" soundid="124458">It&apos;s okay, Ai Ling. I hope... I hope things work out for you.</string>
  <string id="84955" soundid="124459">Come on, Bei. Let&apos;s go.</string>
  <string id="84956" soundid="124460">If I had more, I would gladly give it to you. But my family isn&apos;t rich; this dowry is all I have. Please, take it with my thanks.</string>
  <string id="84957" soundid="124461">You can&apos;t be serious. Ai Ling would kill her!</string>
  <string id="84966" soundid="129088">Make your way there. I will stay behind to tend the furnaces. If you need more information, supplies, or even training, you know where to find me.</string>
  <string id="84984" soundid="129090">It&apos;s good to see you again. Is there anything I can do for you?</string>
  <string id="84985" soundid="129091">Greetings, my friend. Have you had any luck finding the crystal?</string>
  <string id="84986">That&apos;s because he&apos;s afraid of you.</string>
  <string id="84987">You can&apos;t force him to marry you.</string>
  <string id="84988">I guess he&apos;s getting what he deserves.</string>
  <string id="84989">I think you&apos;re lying about Bei proposing.</string>
  <string id="84991">Seems like you&apos;re being unreasonable, Ai Ling.</string>
  <string id="84993">Glad to be of service.</string>
  <string id="84997" soundid="196171"></string>
  <string id="84998">That&apos;s it? I was hoping for more.</string>
  <string id="85010" soundid="129092">You have it? Excellent! I should return and report this to Lord Yun. He will want to hear this news.</string>
  <string id="85012" soundid="129094">I am a hunter, not a warrior. My gifts lie in moving swiftly, silently, and alone. The news must be brought to Lord Yun and it is my duty to bring it.</string>
  <string id="85015" soundid="129097">The crystal fits into the central pedestal atop these steps, unlocking the lens arms in the lower furnaces so they can direct light to the remaining furnaces. </string>
  <string id="85017">Was that a key you put in my pack?</string>
  <string id="85037" soundid="129103">Hey! I&apos;m not some cheap bottle of wine to be passed around! Damn it, even wine shouldn&apos;t be passed, in my opinion.</string>
  <string id="85038" soundid="129104">Lord Yun paid you very well to safeguard his men, and now you&apos;re being paid to safeguard his new agent. Surely you don&apos;t mean to go back on your word?</string>
  <string id="85039" soundid="129105">My word isn&apos;t worth a damn thing. That said, I&apos;m still reeling from actually losing to anyone short of an army.</string>
  <string id="85040">Fine, hand it over.</string>
  <string id="85059" soundid="129106">My only rules are; don&apos;t touch my axes, don&apos;t touch my wine, and don&apos;t get between me and my enemies. If you can live with that, we&apos;ll get along just fine.</string>
  <string id="85060" soundid="129107">Well, you and me and Little Miss Magenta here. Maybe she can distract our foes, flash a little leg.</string>
  <string id="85061" soundid="129108">Would you like to see the damage these legs can inflict firsthand?</string>
  <string id="85062" soundid="129109">Well... you, me, and the fellow with the dark hands and dark looks.</string>
  <string id="85063" soundid="129110">I already tire of this fool. Keep him away from me if you want him to stay alive.</string>
  <string id="85064" soundid="129111">Well... you, me, and the pretty boy. You must be wealthy to have your own eunuch.</string>
  <string id="85065" soundid="129112">Ha! You&apos;re going to fit right in.  You must like to dice, correct?</string>

  <string id="85067" soundid="129114">Well... you, me, and the kid. I hope she&apos;s well trained.</string>
  <string id="85068" soundid="129115">You smell funny.</string>
  <string id="85069" soundid="129116">Whoa... almost didn&apos;t see the little guy. Is he with you, too?</string>
  <string id="85070" soundid="129117">Yep, just you and me, bashing aside anything that gets in our way.</string>
  <string id="85071" soundid="129118">Be safe. The spirits willing, I will reach Lord Yun&apos;s camp quickly. If you need more supplies or training, that is where I will be.</string>
  <string id="85072" soundid="129119">Let&apos;s go find something and make its day a lot worse.</string>
  <string id="85073" soundid="129120">Hey, careful, now. I&apos;m being paid to look after you, and not doing that would break the code.</string>
  <string id="85074" soundid="129121">To be fair, I don&apos;t remember what the code says, but I&apos;m standing by it, so you&apos;re stuck with me.</string>
  <string id="85075" soundid="129122">You got it. But you can&apos;t actually *use* my axes. Just so we&apos;re clear, I&apos;m the only one who touches the axes.</string>
  <string id="85076" soundid="129123">Right. If I&apos;m lucky, something will try to jump me on the way there. Though I bet you&apos;ve ruined the fun by clearing a path for me already. Maybe I&apos;ll take the long way.</string>
  <string id="85077" soundid="129124">Have a look and tell me what you need. I&apos;m collecting the silver to honor the men we lost to these accursed ghosts.</string>
  <string id="85078" soundid="129125">I have a small stock of supplies, and I can also train you to be more precise and focused in battle. My name is well earned, some tell me.</string>
  <string id="85082">Door</string>
  <string id="85084">Thug</string>
  <string id="85087" soundid="124073">They took it pretty hard. Even after all the beatings I gave them over the years, they still aren&apos;t used to losing to a girl. Maybe the humiliation will be good for them.</string>
  <string id="85088" soundid="124074">You&apos;d think after all the beatings I gave them over the years they&apos;d be used to losing, but they&apos;re still taking it pretty hard. Maybe the humiliation will be good for them.</string>
  <string id="85089" soundid="124075">I know what you&apos;re thinking. Why would Bei want to marry someone like me?</string>
  <string id="85090" soundid="124076">No, I bet he didn&apos;t. Wouldn&apos;t want to go around telling people how he left me high and dry, would he?</string>
  <string id="85091" soundid="124077">I may not be a delicate little flower like Lan, but I don&apos;t want to run this gang forever. Someday I want a husband. Maybe a little house. Kids, too.</string>
  <string id="85093">He promised to marry you?</string>
  <string id="85094">I don&apos;t believe you.</string>
  <string id="85096">Bei never said anything about this.</string>
  <string id="85100" soundid="129131">The Great Southern Forest is vast, but we&apos;re within a day&apos;s journey of Tien&apos;s Landing. If you&apos;re weary, however, the Pilgrim&apos;s Rest Inn lies at the top of this hill.</string>
  <string id="85105" soundid="129136">Lord Yun&apos;s family has maintained it for centuries, although Lord Yun seems to care little for it. It is as if he is embarrased by it somehow.</string>
  <string id="85108" soundid="129139">To tell the truth, I really can&apos;t say why he is the way he is. Might be something to do with the Forest Shadow. You could always ask him.</string>
  <string id="85109" soundid="129140">We hunters think differently of the two Ways: the Open Palm and the Closed Fist. A hunter&apos;s life must be one of balance if one wishes to excel.</string>
  <string id="85119" soundid="129150">To kill without purpose is evil. But if you hunt to feed and clothe your family, you act with intent. The hunter uses discord to achieve harmony; all is in balance.</string>
  <string id="85125" soundid="129156">Balance is itself a choice. For a hunter it is vital. We must be in harmony with nature if we wish to stalk our prey, yet rely on discord to make the kill.</string>
  <string id="85127" soundid="129158">What else did you need?</string>
  <string id="85128" soundid="129159">Lord Yun is satisfied with what you have done. I can only hope the forest will recover.</string>
  <string id="85129" soundid="129160">Thank you again for all you have done.</string>
  <string id="85130" soundid="129161">Step safely. The ghosts grow more aggressive by the hour.</string>
  <string id="85131" soundid="137217">I suppose an emperor deserves a tomb like this if anyone does, but I&apos;d prefer a simple memorial.</string>
  <string id="85132" soundid="182899">Perhaps, but Sun Hai did not have your amulet. Fortunately, you now see that, as a Spirit Monk, essence gems will serve you without it. It is a pathway, not a source of power.</string>
  <string id="85133" soundid="137219">This neglect is infuriating. This is the center of the Empire, yet they let it rot from the inside out.</string>
  <string id="85134" soundid="137220">Is this even... possible?</string>
  <string id="85135" soundid="137221">Don&apos;t underestimate him. Your master is just toying with you.</string>
  <string id="85142">How would she feel about cannibals?</string>
  <string id="85143">The Pilgrim&apos;s Rest was full of them. I have eliminated some, but there are more.</string>
  <string id="85145">You&apos;d rather not know.</string>
  <string id="85146">Couldn&apos;t this all be her fault?</string>
  <string id="85148">Would there be a reason she would attack someone from the inn?</string>
  <string id="85149">That&apos;s all I need to know about the attack.</string>
  <string id="85151">This&apos;ll be the end!</string>
  <string id="85154">The Treasury</string>
  <string id="85155">Dirge Fountain</string>
  <string id="85156">I have the crystal here.</string>
  <string id="85157">If you had thought to go ask at the inn, you&apos;d already have your crystal.</string>
  <string id="85158">Do you have any idea where the crystal might be?</string>
  <string id="85159">You&apos;ve made yourself useful setting up the furnaces.</string>
  <string id="85160">Diseased</string>
  <string id="85161">What was strange about them?</string>
  <string id="85162">Some sort of animal took the crystal?</string>
  <string id="85165">Drain the Chi of the target.</string>
  <string id="85166">I met a man from the inn on my way up here.</string>
  <string id="85170">I have the missing crystal here.</string>
  <string id="85172">It&apos;s safest if you get out of here, I agree.</string>
  <string id="85173">You&apos;re running like a coward?</string>
  <string id="85176">What needs to be done for this ritual?</string>
  <string id="85182">That&apos;s all I need to know, I&apos;ll see what can be done.</string>
  <string id="85184">I&apos;m sure I can find a use for him.</string>
  <string id="85185">So long as he does what he&apos;s told, he could prove useful.</string>
  <string id="85186">He&apos;s a buffoon. Take him with you.</string>
  <string id="85189">Stick with me and you&apos;ll see more than that.</string>
  <string id="85203">Forget it. I honestly have no need of your services.</string>
  <string id="85205">Come with me now. I could use your axes.</string>
  <string id="85207">Make your way to Tien&apos;s Landing, and look for my other followers.</string>
  <string id="85210">What supplies and training do you have available?</string>
  <string id="85214">If you find your enemy is immune to a particular style, try switching to a style from a different school. </string>
  <string id="85215">The bars in the upper left-hand corner of the screen show your Health (red), Chi (blue), and Focus (yellow).</string>
  <string id="85216">Magic styles use up Chi (blue bar), while weapon styles use up Focus (yellow bar).</string>
  <string id="85217">Press &lt;Menu&gt; to see more information about your character, fighting styles, journal, map, and other options.</string>
  <string id="85218">I have some questions for you.</string>
  <string id="85219">What has your time as a hunter taught you about this forest?</string>
  <string id="85221">Do you have any idea why this forest has grown ill?</string>
  <string id="85223">Press the &lt;ChiHeal&gt; key to spend Chi and regain Health.</string>
  <string id="85224">What&apos;s the story behind this temple?</string>
  <string id="85226">Why would he be embarrassed about a temple?</string>
  <string id="85227">I&apos;d be embarrassed too, the structure is gaudy.</string>
  <string id="85229">That&apos;s enough about the forest. You mentioned philosophy earlier?</string>
  <string id="85230">What sort of philosophy would you contemplate here?</string>
  <string id="85236">Push &lt;FreeTarget&gt; to enter Free Target mode. Push it again to exit.</string>
  <string id="85239">A book icon on the left side of the screen indicates a new journal entry. </string>
  <string id="85240">Wouldn&apos;t hunting be an evil act?</string>
  <string id="85242">Switch targets by hitting &lt;NextPage&gt;.</string>
  <string id="85245">I&apos;m not sure I have the luxury of balance.</string>
  <string id="85246">Pause the game in combat by pushing &lt;CombatPause&gt;. Push it again to unpause.</string>
  <string id="85247">Once you have more than one follower, you can switch among them on the Followers screen in the Start menu.</string>
  <string id="85250">Let&apos;s go back to my questions about the forest.</string>
  <string id="85251">That&apos;s enough questions for now.</string>
  <string id="85252">Goodbye.</string>
  <string id="85253" soundid="129284">You seem tired, Dawn Star. Make sure you get some rest; our journey will only get longer, and you&apos;ve been through a great deal.</string>
  <string id="85254" soundid="129285">Thank you, Zu. I&apos;m fine. I will find time once we have set things right.</string>
  <string id="85255" soundid="129286">The *Black* Whirlwind, and I barely fit in that Spectacular Gnat of yours. It lists like a pregnant ox when I step in.</string>
  <string id="85256" soundid="129287">It is hardly his fault, you are well in excess of a normal person&apos;s size.</string>
  <string id="85257" soundid="129288">Hey, Zu, why exactly are you here? I can&apos;t quite figure you out. You&apos;re much more of a loner than any of the others.</string>
  <string id="85258" soundid="129289">And you are much more a rogue than you let on. We each have things we keep to ourselves. If I wanted you to know them, you wouldn&apos;t have to ask.</string>
  <string id="85259" soundid="129290">Dawn Star, that&apos;s a very fitting name for you. Bright, cheerful, and beautiful.</string>
  <string id="85260" soundid="129291">That&apos;s kind of you to say, Sky, but I fear it is rooted in something far darker.</string>
  <string id="85262">Silver &lt;CUSTOM0&gt;</string>
  <string id="85263">The flyer you took from Gao&apos;s men in Two Rivers proved as untrustworthy as its original owners. Pirates around the village of Tien&apos;s Landing seem to have similar devices, however, so it may be worth your time to try and seek them out.</string>
  <string id="85264">Find a New Flyer</string>
  <string id="85267" soundid="129298">Hmmm... you&apos;re a princess, eh? You don&apos;t look like any nobility I&apos;ve ever seen.</string>
  <string id="85268" soundid="129299">And what, pray tell, does nobility look like to a wine-soaked sot like you?</string>
  <string id="85269" soundid="129300">Wide-eyed and terror-stricken when I kick in their doors. But I guess that&apos;s why you live in a palace in the sky... not so easy to break those doors down.</string>
  <string id="85270" soundid="129301">What? I said she *wasn&apos;t* like the nobility I&apos;m used to. Besides... if she wanted to be pampered, she wouldn&apos;t be here. </string>
  <string id="85271" soundid="129302">I&apos;d like to know, er, Silk Fox, why do you go to the trouble to dress up like... that? As Princess, couldn&apos;t you just command that changes be made? </string>
  <string id="85272" soundid="129303">You can&apos;t understand. My place in the order of things is as much a cage as yours, but stepping down grants certain opportunities to influence that are unavailable to you.</string>
  <string id="85273" soundid="129304">What do you mean by that?</string>
  <string id="85274" soundid="129305">So... ah, Kang, how many iterations of your flyers did you make before settling on such a... safe design?</string>
  <string id="85275">You dare resist?!</string>
  <string id="85276">Die, filth!</string>
  <string id="85279" soundid="129310">The Imperial City must be somewhat bewildering to you, Dawn Star. If you need anything explained, I will be happy to assist you.</string>
  <string id="85280">You are nothing!</string>
  <string id="85281">My will prevails!</string>
  <string id="85282">Your end is here!</string>
  <string id="85283">Die now!</string>
  <string id="85284" soundid="129315">This will likely get me into trouble, but I have to ask. Is your wife really that bad, Hou? You must be... exaggerating to some degree, right?</string>
  <string id="85285" soundid="129316">I exaggerate nothing, but I will not discuss such things so close to my home here in the city. My watchful wife has habit of appearing when I least expect it.</string>
  <string id="85286" soundid="129317">It must be very difficult for you to bear such a burden, Wild Flower, to be so young and anchor such a creature. I can sense the turmoil within you.</string>
  <string id="85287" soundid="129318">Hmm... sometimes it&apos;s hard, but then the Guardian tells me it&apos;s all right, and it is! I try my best for him.</string>
  <string id="85288" soundid="129319">Kang! When will you fix your flying barrel to fit real people?</string>
  <string id="85289" soundid="129320">What is the problem, Whirlwind?  </string>
  <string id="85294">Be careful how you address the Emperor&apos;s daughter.</string>
  <string id="85297">Your life is over!</string>
  <string id="85303">I am restored!</string>
  <string id="85304">You... you poisoned me?!</string>
  <string id="85312">Your reluctance is well founded, Dawn Star.</string>
  <string id="85316">Gate</string>
  <string id="85317">Door</string>
  <string id="85318">Door</string>
  <string id="85347" soundid="152350">I promised you I wouldn&apos;t be a distraction, but I have to say something.</string>
  <string id="85350" soundid="129452"></string>
  <string id="85352">You sicken me!</string>
  <string id="85354">I want to talk about Gentle Breezes.</string>
  <string id="85356">I want you to resign your post, Fang.</string>
  <string id="85358">Your activities cost you your Imperial Ring.</string>
  <string id="85359">Breezes gave me your Imperial Ring.</string>
  <string id="85362">You&apos;re going to step down, Fang.</string>
  <string id="85363">The Lotus Assassins want you out of the picture.</string>
  <string id="85364">Give me a letter of resignation. Right now.</string>
  <string id="85367">I&apos;m proud to get a man like you out of office.</string>
  <string id="85372">Your own perversions brought this on you.</string>
  <string id="85373">Just give me your resignation.</string>
  <string id="85374" soundid="129476">You better go talk to Fang about that ring.</string>
  <string id="85375" soundid="129477">Yeah, we don&apos;t want any part of this.</string>
  <string id="85376" soundid="129478">Forget it! I won&apos;t go into details about what Fang did to the last guard he caught taking bribes, but restraints, starving dogs, and gravy on certain parts of the body were involved.</string>
  <string id="85377" soundid="129479">Fang watched the whole thing, laughing all the while. And when it was done, he went upstairs with Breezes for a little relaxation. Poor girl.</string>
  <string id="85378" soundid="129480">Thanks, champ. We appreciate it.</string>
  <string id="85379" soundid="129481">Okay. Good luck in your next fight.</string>
  <string id="85380" soundid="129482">Good idea. Come back next month. Fang might be taking appointments by then.</string>
  <string id="85381" soundid="129483"></string>
  <string id="85382" soundid="129484">Wow, the Imperial Champion! Hey, it&apos;s a real honor to have you come up here but... uh... you&apos;re going to have to back up. Please.</string>
  <string id="85383" soundid="129485">Nothing personal, but we work for Fang and he doesn&apos;t want anyone blocking his view. He comes to watch the fights, not talk to the fighters.</string>
  <string id="85384" soundid="129486"></string>
  <string id="85385" soundid="129487">Saw you out there in the ring. You got real potential. Even Fang was impressed.</string>
  <string id="85386" soundid="129488">But that doesn&apos;t mean he wants you blocking his view, so back up. He comes here to watch the fights, not talk to the fighters.</string>
  <string id="85387" soundid="129489">I guess he figures the more he talks to you, the less time you have to inflict horrible, bloody carnage on someone in the ring.</string>
  <string id="85388" soundid="129490">Normally Fang&apos;s into rough girls, but he likes them dirty, too. You&apos;re a bit too classy for his tastes. He&apos;d rather watch you in the ring than have a more intimate meeting.</string>
  <string id="85389" soundid="129491">Whoa! Back up a bit there. Judge Fang doesn&apos;t like people blocking his view of the arena.</string>
  <string id="85390" soundid="129492">Yeah, you might make him miss out on seeing someone get their nose broken. Or their leg. Or even their skull.</string>
  <string id="85391" soundid="129493">He was just saying how there hasn&apos;t been a good skull fracture for at least a week. It&apos;s put him in a foul mood.</string>
  <string id="85392" soundid="129494">Even a pretty lady like you. You might make him miss out on someone getting their nose broken. Or their leg. Or even their skull.</string>
  <string id="85393" soundid="129495">Look, we already told you, Fang doesn&apos;t want to be bothered. He just wants to relax and watch the arena fights.</string>
  <string id="85394" soundid="129496">Yeah. If he doesn&apos;t get his daily fill of blood, violence, and gore, he&apos;ll be snarly all day. And he&apos;s hard enough to work for when he&apos;s in a good mood.</string>
  <string id="85395" soundid="129497">How did you get... no, forget it. I don&apos;t want to know.</string>
  <string id="85396" soundid="129498">I wouldn&apos;t call him sick and twisted. That&apos;s an insult to sick and twisted people everywhere. Fang&apos;s on a whole other level.</string>
  <string id="85397" soundid="129499">I never used to believe the stories, but now that I&apos;m working for him, I can honestly say he&apos;s the most degenerate and perverted man in the whole Empire.</string>
  <string id="85398" soundid="129500">But he pays well. Very well. Enough so that we pretend not to see what&apos;s going on. Though I still feel bad for Breezes sometimes.</string>
  <string id="85399" soundid="129501">Gentle Breezes. She&apos;s Fang&apos;s... uh... concubine. She&apos;s over in the next room with the common folk. Fang doesn&apos;t like to be seen with her in public.</string>
  <string id="85400" soundid="129502">He doesn&apos;t mind her getting up close and personal when they&apos;re in private, though. The things she does for him...</string>
  <string id="85401" soundid="129503">Sometimes he makes us watch. Gives him an extra thrill, I guess, but I usually have to block out most of what they do. Breezes has got a stronger stomach than I do.</string>
  <string id="85402" soundid="129504">Not without an appointment. And his schedule&apos;s full for the next month. All the ministers are coming in from the outlying towns to make their reports.</string>
  <string id="85403" soundid="129505">If he&apos;s not meeting with a minister, he&apos;s relaxing here. Hoping to see somebody beaten to a quivering pulp in the ring, or maybe torn apart by one of the animals.</string>
  <string id="85404" soundid="129506">Yeah, that or he&apos;s taking a break with Breezes. Poor girl. No amount of silver is worth what she does for him.</string>
  <string id="85417">I&apos;ve got Fang&apos;s Imperial Ring.</string>
  <string id="85418">Sounds like one sick and twisted man.</string>
  <string id="85421">Who is Breezes?</string>
  <string id="85424">Can I speak to Judge Fang?</string>
  <string id="85427">Let me speak to Fang and I&apos;ll make it worth your while.</string>
  <string id="85429">I&apos;ll be going now.</string>
  <string id="85645" soundid="129880">You have come from Tien&apos;s Landing?</string>
  <string id="85646" soundid="129881">You were? This is good. I was going there, but you&apos;re coming here instead.</string>
  <string id="85648" soundid="129883">There are many ghosts here. You have to be fast to get around them and quiet or they will hear you.</string>
  <string id="85649" soundid="129884">I come from the inn, the Pilgrim&apos;s Rest. You must take a message to the town for us!</string>
  <string id="85650" soundid="129885">Things are very bad. We starve! The ghosts cut us off from everything, but we are still up there. Tien&apos;s Landing must send people to help!</string>
  <string id="85651" soundid="129886">Ugh! This poor soul has been in the forest too long. He feels... wrong, just like the air here. It&apos;s disturbing. </string>
  <string id="85652" soundid="129887">He seems... simple, as well. I wonder if the horrors of this place have touched his mind.</string>
  <string id="85653" soundid="129888">Chai Ka: This one&apos;s mind seems... unbalanced.</string>
  <string id="85654" soundid="154558">Your end is here, mortal!</string>
  <string id="85655" soundid="129890">I&apos;ve known a few fellows who sounded like this, and not one of them was right in the head.</string>
  <string id="85656" soundid="129891">If I had to guess, I&apos;d say this mongrel&apos;s mind has collapsed on itself from being trapped in this ghost-infested place.</string>
  <string id="85657" soundid="129892">Many people should come to the inn to help us. They can&apos;t let us starve!</string>
  <string id="85658" soundid="129893">You would be welcome there. They would have you for a most fun stay!</string>
  <string id="85659" soundid="129894">The inn lies above, on the path to the right.</string>
  <string id="85660" soundid="129895">The temple? No! The temple is where the ghosts are worst. It is a bad place. You should not go there. You should go to the inn.</string>
  <string id="85661" soundid="129896">No, I should... I should return to the inn. They will want to know you are coming.</string>
  <string id="85662" soundid="129897">You should come with me. I can take the message down later, and you will be safe from the Forest Shadow and her ghosts!</string>
  <string id="85663" soundid="129898">She is a wicked fox spirit! They are tricksters, all of them. The tricks she plays kill now!</string>
  <string id="85664" soundid="129899">You should stay away from her. She hurts us when we leave the inn.</string>
  <string id="85665" soundid="129900">Oh yes, they must be. She hunts us, and these ghosts hunt you, right? Isn&apos;t that the same?</string>
  <string id="85666" soundid="129901">That can&apos;t be right. She is dangerous. You should go to the inn to be kept safe. That&apos;s the only way.</string>
  <string id="85667" soundid="129902">I will go back the way I came. Knowing that there are others here, I will be all right.</string>
  <string id="85668" soundid="129903">I must go back to the inn to tell them. You should follow! The path to the right, not the left. Left goes to the temple, and the Forest Shadow will kill you!</string>
  <string id="85669" soundid="129904">Come! The inn is this way!</string>
  <string id="85670">Kang the Mad has locked the Temple Gate behind his party as a last line of defense if the mission to destroy the bridge proved to be unsuccessful.</string>
  <string id="85671">Yes, I was in Tien&apos;s Landing.</string>
  <string id="85673">Who are you?</string>
  <string id="85675">Why are you wandering alone with so many ghosts around?</string>
  <string id="85680">Where is this Pilgrim&apos;s Rest Inn?</string>
  <string id="85682">I&apos;m looking for a temple on the path above. Can you direct me?</string>
  <string id="85683">I will escort you to Tien&apos;s Landing. You can take the message yourself.</string>
  <string id="85684">I don&apos;t have time to baby-sit some simpleton. Make your own way.</string>
  <string id="85686">Tell me more about the Forest Shadow.</string>
  <string id="85688">These ghosts are the Forest Shadow&apos;s minions?</string>
  <string id="85689">Others I&apos;ve talked to seemed to think the Forest Shadow might be able to help.</string>
  <string id="85690">I should keep moving. Will you be all right in this forest?</string>
  <string id="85692">I&apos;ve had about enough of you. Go where you wish.</string>
  <string id="85695" soundid="129993">You make a wise decision, thin-blood. Our people will prosper now that you have freed us from the fox. Take this scroll and study it when you have the chance.</string>
  <string id="85697" soundid="129995">As a final gift, we give you this... cook. He is useless to us; he shivers like a leaf in winter. Remove him before his weakness infects us.</string>
  <string id="85698" soundid="129996">Ha! That is why we like you! You are practically one of us, but for all that, your blood is still thin and watery!</string>
  <string id="85699" soundid="129997">Do you see those arms? That neck? No, there is no strength to be found in this one, not for us.</string>
  <string id="85700" soundid="129998">It is said that this one knows a secret: a style rarely seen in the Jade Empire. If nothing else, you may be able to extract it from him.</string>
  <string id="85701" soundid="129999">Now go. Leave us to our plans.</string>
  <string id="85702" soundid="130000">My people, this is the treachery of the thin-bloods! Gather, and we will show this fool our true strength!</string>
  <string id="85703" soundid="130001">Gaze upon our forms and bask in our glory! You should be honored to see the true strength of the cannibals!</string>
  <string id="85704" soundid="130002">Didn&apos;t see that coming. If they&apos;re as aggressive as they are ugly, then this will get bloody fast. The faster the better!</string>
  <string id="85705" soundid="130003">Chai Ka: Cannibals. Twisted servants of a greater demon. This explains the forest&apos;s corruption.</string>
  <string id="85706" soundid="130004">It&apos;s them! Their corruption is what I have been feeling in this forest. They are... vile!</string>
  <string id="85707" soundid="130005">I&apos;m suddenly very glad I didn&apos;t order anything from the kitchen.</string>
  <string id="85709" soundid="130007">Under a demon&apos;s influence, men can twist into these things. They are cannibals, and we are in danger. Don&apos;t underestimate their strength!</string>
  <string id="85710" soundid="130008">I sense in you a kindred spirit. You know power for what it is: a tool to sweep aside those weaker than you.</string>
  <string id="85711" soundid="130009">Because of your nature, I wanted to work with you in the open. We are the powerful ones in this forest, and our majesty must spread!</string>
  <string id="85712" soundid="130010">We are sensitive to strength, and you are not like the meat out there. You speak with power and conviction. We can respect such strength.</string>
  <string id="85713" soundid="130011">Some part of you must have known that the Spirit did not detest us because we were weak humans! No, she feared our majesty!</string>
  <string id="85714" soundid="130012">Are you happy, now that you have the answer to your prying questions? No, of course not. You wish to know more. You are drawn to our majesty!</string>
  <string id="85715" soundid="130013">Intriguing, yes? Such power is hard to resist, is it not?</string>
  <string id="85716" soundid="130014">You know nothing of beauty. You know nothing at all!</string>
  <string id="85717" soundid="130015">How typical of the thin-blooded ones, to think that they can kill all that they do not understand.</string>
  <string id="85718" soundid="130016">You must understand that we are servants of a powerful demon known as the Mother, who has taught us to draw strength from human flesh!</string>
  <string id="85719" soundid="130017">The Forest Shadow imprisoned her millennia ago, but you have freed her! Our Mother will rise up and consume all who stand in her way.</string>
  <string id="85720" soundid="130018">Your kind is concerned with nothing more than silver and prizes. You are pathetic and weak willed. </string>
  <string id="85721" soundid="130019">Fine, human. You will have more than we agreed upon. We gathered the silver while you were off killing the Forest Shadow.</string>
  <string id="85722" soundid="130020">You think you can end a feud older than your petty Empire by destroying both sides?</string>
  <string id="85723" soundid="130021">Such foolish pride. With the fox dead, the Mother is free! She will consume all, and you will be first!</string>
  <string id="85724" soundid="130022">You have already killed the fox! This forest will only grow worse, no matter what you do.</string>
  <string id="85725" soundid="130023">The Mother is too strong for you. She will consume all who stand in her way, and you will be first!</string>
  <string id="85726" soundid="130024">The Forest Shadow imprisoned her millennia ago, but soon she will be free! You will help us with that, or you will die!</string>
  <string id="85727" soundid="130025">That makes two of us.</string>
  <string id="85728" soundid="130026">(Hiss.) Freaks! You are nothing but meat!</string>
  <string id="85729" soundid="130027">We have made you an offer. The bargain was vast amounts of your precious silver for the life of the Forest Shadow. Now we add your life to the deal, as well. </string>
  <string id="85730" soundid="130028">The fox holds the Mother trapped within the earth of this hill, but she can hold nothing with dying paws. </string>
  <string id="85731" soundid="130029">The dead walk the world, and the Mother can draw strength from them. That is how she reached out to us... told us of the new way.</string>
  <string id="85732" soundid="130030">The Mother grows stronger each day, but she is still trapped, and the Forest Shadow is not yet so weak as to be easily taken. She knows us instantly, so we have no surprise.</string>
  <string id="85733" soundid="130031">You are unknown. We cannot defeat her, but she cannot destroy us so easily, either. She will try to pour honey into your ears, beg for your help.</string>
  <string id="85734" soundid="130032">When her guard is down, then you will destroy her, and the Mother will be free!</string>
  <string id="85735" soundid="130033">She is a most powerful creature from a time when primal hunger ruled all of your kind. She has been trapped in this hill for centuries... trapped by the fox.</string>
  <string id="85736" soundid="130034">But as the dead grow restless, she feels their anger, their rage, and their hunger for release. They feed the Mother, and she grows strong as the ghosts flock to her.</string>
  <string id="85737" soundid="130035">She reached out to us. We are her children, and I am first among them!</string>
  <string id="85738" soundid="130036">She is the filthy fox spirit that imprisoned the Mother centuries before the Empire was born. Like all foxes, she is a trickster and thinks of herself as a judge of wrong and right.</string>
  <string id="85739" soundid="130037">She claimed this forest as hers, gloating over the imprisonment of the Mother, but she did not count on the ghosts filling her forest.</string>
  <string id="85740" soundid="130038">The Mother called to them, and their rage, their hunger for release, has restored much of her strength. The time of the fox is over!</string>
  <string id="85741" soundid="130039">You are so very stupid. What the Mother has given us is no curse! This is power!</string>
  <string id="85742" soundid="130040">We eat the flesh of your kind, and its energies make us strong! The Mother has beautified us in return for serving her.</string>
  <string id="85743" soundid="130041">You should not speak about killing the Mother. It is a sacrilege that makes our blood boil with rage!</string>
  <string id="85744" soundid="130042">What will it be? Do you value your life, or will you play the fool?</string>
  <string id="85745" soundid="130043">You just don&apos;t understand. You will!</string>
  <string id="85746" soundid="130044">You have made a very wise decision. I would suspect that you were lying to me, but only a fool would think to cross us.</string>
  <string id="85747" soundid="130045">Our offer stands firm. Go swiftly, and there may be even more than silver awaiting you.</string>
  <string id="85748" soundid="130046">Monsters? We are perfection! Allow us to demonstrate the truth!</string>
  <string id="85749" soundid="130047">Rend her flesh! Her screams should echo in the town below!</string>
  <string id="85750" soundid="130048">Tear him to pieces! We will feast tonight on those succulent flanks!</string>
  <string id="85751" soundid="130049">Where did you... Ahhhh! The Spirit! She is dead, and you are returned to us by the heavens themselves!</string>
  <string id="85752" soundid="130050">You have done us a great service, and soon we will feast... to celebrate.</string>
  <string id="85753" soundid="130051">Did she? Did she cry it out with her dying breath? Ha! The Forest Shadow is not so powerful.</string>
  <string id="85754" soundid="130052">Oh, and you shall have it. Yes, you shall have a most special reward.</string>
  <string id="85755" soundid="130053">She did deserve her death, and you... you deserve so much more.</string>
  <string id="85756" soundid="130054">I offer you a most unique chance. Look, and see the glory you have set free!</string>
  <string id="85757" soundid="130055">See us as we truly are!</string>
  <string id="85758" soundid="130056">You have a spirit to kill, do you not? We will know when she is dead, for the Mother will be free.</string>
  <string id="85759" soundid="130057">Go to the temple. Find a way to get her attention or track her down. Once you have her, tear her head from her shoulders.</string>
  <string id="85760" soundid="130058">Until you have succeeded, do not bother me unless you wish to lose an arm.</string>
  <string id="85761" soundid="130059">You know more than you need to, human.</string>
  <string id="85762" soundid="130060">Gather the cook and leave us before we grow hungry.</string>
  <string id="85763" soundid="130061">Leave before our hunger prompts us to have you for dinner.</string>
  <string id="85764" soundid="130062">I watched in awe as you dispatched those... things! Not many of your kind can deal with ghosts as easily as you did! </string>
  <string id="85765" soundid="130063">Yes, the ghosts are most dangerous. We are fortunate that they have not yet ventured inside the inn. It offers us some refuge.</string>
  <string id="85766" soundid="130064">What help could we offer to someone like you?</string>
  <string id="85767" soundid="130065">No, no, no, heavens no! You are a warrior, are you not? Bound by honor and given strength by training? Is that not the noblest of classes?</string>
  <string id="85768" soundid="130066">No apologies needed. These are stressful times for us all.</string>
  <string id="85769" soundid="130067">You are of a kind, aren&apos;t you? Clearly deserving of respect and consideration.</string>
  <string id="85770" soundid="130068">But I&apos;ve forgotten myself. Welcome to the Pilgrim&apos;s Rest, traveler. I am the Keeper, as they call me.</string>
  <string id="85772" soundid="137229">You know what I like about private clubs? The tasteful decor.</string>
  <string id="85773" soundid="137230">The Tien&apos;s Landing teahouse has a reputation as a rough place. Should be entertaining.</string>
  <string id="85774" soundid="137231">Stranded sailors make for rich courtesans. At this rate, these ladies will own half the town before long.</string>
  <string id="85777" soundid="130075">Tell me, did you happen to come across one of us on your way up here? We sent him not long ago to search for help.</string>
  <string id="85780" soundid="135877">Oh, nothing that matters now. It was a fool&apos;s hope to think I might learn anything.</string>
  <string id="85781" soundid="135878">I am tasked with safeguarding any lands that I own, and this land is far from safe. To admit failure would be... unfortunate for my house.</string>
  <string id="85783" soundid="130081">It was the Forest Shadow! She has taken another from us!</string>
  <string id="85787" soundid="137237">Too far to jump. We&apos;ll have to find another way.</string>
  <string id="85788" soundid="130086">We are a long way from the Imperial City here. The tax collector&apos;s arms are only so long, you know.</string>
  <string id="85789" soundid="130087">There can be no other way. The Forest Shadow must die... to save us and cure this forest.</string>
  <string id="85793">Gem of Pure Flame</string>
  <string id="85799">Gem of Freezing</string>
  <string id="85801" soundid="130099">You must join us for dinner. You would be a most welcome addition!</string>
  <string id="85802" soundid="130100">The Mother? Nothing. Nothing at all. You should not speak nonsense when the Forest Shadow is still alive!</string>
  <string id="85803" soundid="130101">Did he? How... unfortunate. We should have tipped him into his own pot weeks ago!</string>
  <string id="85804" soundid="130102">You truly wish to know? Your mind will not rest until you have an answer?</string>
  <string id="85805" soundid="130103">You are lucky that I sense such great strength from you. Had you dealt with those ghosts out front with less efficiency, I would tear your throat out.</string>
  <string id="85806" soundid="130104">But, please, allow me to reveal all that you wish to see. Let me show you the truth!</string>
  <string id="85807" soundid="130105">We shall forget this moment, then, shall we? Do you wish to know anything else?</string>
  <string id="85808" soundid="130106">This is the mad fox&apos;s place. I shudder to dwell too long on the subject, but I will answer what I can.</string>
  <string id="85809" soundid="130107">The forest has been ailing for some time now, but things have been especially bad over the past month.</string>
  <string id="85810" soundid="130108">It has been most unpleasant for us. No new visitors grace our tables with their presence.</string>
  <string id="85811" soundid="130109">I do not know. Maybe the fox spirit that claims to protect this place has diseased it, or perhaps she is just too weak to fight another disease.</string>
  <string id="85812" soundid="130110">I don&apos;t care what happens to her, so long as my people... those of us at the inn, I mean, stay safe.</string>
  <string id="85813" soundid="130111">I have heard that the Pilgrim&apos;s Path stays open to the town of Tien&apos;s Landing.</string>
  <string id="85814" soundid="130112">One day, when the time is right, we shall make our way down there. Tien&apos;s Landing is full of so many people.</string>
  <string id="85815" soundid="130113">I do, as well. This forest is an uncomfortable topic for us all.</string>
  <string id="85816" soundid="130114">Many travelers know the name of the Pilgrim&apos;s Rest, and before long, so will many more.</string>
  <string id="85817" soundid="130115">It is an old name. The route you climbed used to be called the Pilgrim&apos;s Path, thanks largely to the temple near here, and other small shrines.</string>
  <string id="85818" soundid="130116">Here, at the hill&apos;s summit, the pilgrims would stay and contemplate what they had seen during their climb. </string>
  <string id="85819" soundid="130117">This place was known as the Pilgrim&apos;s Rest long before the inn was constructed.</string>
  <string id="85820" soundid="130118">Of course. This whole forest belongs to Lord Yun, does it not? He expects this place to pay him a &quot;tribute.&quot; He doesn&apos;t call it that, but we know the truth.</string>
  <string id="85821" soundid="130119">Mark me. Lord Yun will have his share of the proceeds from this place before long. His fair share.</string>
  <string id="85822" soundid="130120">Surviving? Simple. You can still find meat if you know where to look, and is meat not the heart of any good dish?</string>
  <string id="85823" soundid="130121">The sick trees and ghosts, yes, they keep us from the animals. You make a good point, but still, we saw this coming, did we not?</string>
  <string id="85824" soundid="130122">Of course, of course. Those are important for the blood, are they not? They keep it rich and fresh.</string>
  <string id="85825" soundid="130123">We have supplies. It always pays to be prepared.</string>
  <string id="85826" soundid="130124">Of course.</string>
  <string id="85827" soundid="130125">There must be some way to trap the fox. We will find it somehow.</string>
  <string id="85829" soundid="175977">Hold! That&apos;s enough.</string>
  <string id="85830">Follow through on your end of the deal, and we part in peace, keeper.</string>
  <string id="85833">I&apos;ll take him off your hands.</string>
  <string id="85834">He&apos;ll find a way to be useful to me, or he will die.</string>
  <string id="85836">Keep and eat him. He&apos;s no use to either of us.</string>
  <string id="85839">You&apos;ve gathered the silver? Good, because I&apos;m going to destroy you, as well.</string>
  <string id="85849">My nature made you want to reveal yourself?</string>
  <string id="85851">What magic allowed you to cloak yourself so?</string>
  <string id="85853">Majesty? You are disgusting!</string>
  <string id="85855">I don&apos;t know what you are, but you clearly need to die.</string>
  <string id="85858">Do what you wish; I&apos;m only here for my reward.</string>
  <string id="85859">Knowing what you are, the price of my aid has just gone up.</string>
  <string id="85861">This forest has seen enough meddling by demons and spirits. It&apos;s your turn to die.</string>
  <string id="85864">I see I was wrong. Destroying you will be my atonement.</string>
  <string id="85867">Why should I help you?</string>
  <string id="85868">I&apos;m having trouble feeling threatened by a group of freaks.</string>
  <string id="85872">Why not do this yourself? Why do you need my help?</string>
  <string id="85874">I&apos;m still not sure why you&apos;re turning to me.</string>
  <string id="85875">You admit that I am your superior?</string>
  <string id="85877">Tell me more about the Mother.</string>
  <string id="85880">Tell me about the Forest Shadow.</string>
  <string id="85883">What if I killed the Mother? Would that free you from this curse?</string>
  <string id="85886">I have made my decision.</string>
  <string id="85887">You must be destroyed. There&apos;s no other answer.</string>
  <string id="85889">[Lie] I should go find the Spirit now.</string>
  <string id="85891">I will aid you, but I expect to be repaid for my trouble.</string>
  <string id="85892">You&apos;re flesh-eating cannibals! I will never aid you monsters.</string>
  <string id="85897">The Spirit claimed she wasn&apos;t behind the ghosts in this forest.</string>
  <string id="85899">Your celebrations be damned. I&apos;m here for my reward.</string>
  <string id="85901">Spirits have no place manipulating us. She deserved her death.</string>
  <string id="85907">I&apos;m surprised anyone&apos;s still alive up here.</string>
  <string id="85909">It would have been easier with help.</string>
  <string id="85911">My kind? You mean to offend me?</string>
  <string id="85912">You meant no offense. I apologize for taking what was not there.</string>
  <string id="85914">Grovel some more, and I might not kill you.</string>
  <string id="85917" soundid="137244">Don&apos;t ask me how I know, but there&apos;s trouble ahead.</string>
  <string id="85921" soundid="164088">We should move. There could be....</string>
  <string id="85922" soundid="164089">There&apos;s one there! Are they coming out of the walls? I&apos;ll go make sure they aren&apos;t trying to cut us off! You deal with the Mother!</string>
  <string id="85923" soundid="164090">It&apos;s funny how this cave felt less crowded before Whirlwind arrived. Wait, what&apos;s....</string>
  <string id="85924" soundid="164091">Where did that rascal come from? Those small tunnels in the walls? Look, you three go ahead and deal with &quot;Mother.&quot; I&apos;ll make sure we don&apos;t get completely cut off.</string>
  <string id="85930">The man you sent to bring aid from Tien&apos;s Landing was killed.</string>
  <string id="85931">The simpleton? He died at the hands of a fox spirit.</string>
  <string id="85932" soundid="164092">Chai Ka: There are more. Many many more.</string>
  <string id="85933" soundid="137672">Nice place here. Government officials get the best warehouses to sleep in.</string>
  <string id="85934" soundid="137673">If this place is still looking to collect what I owe them, there could be trouble.</string>
  <string id="85937" soundid="137676">If I had to live here for more than a day, I&apos;d throw myself off the nearest cliff.</string>
  <string id="85938">Where would a humble innkeeper get that kind of money?</string>
  <string id="85939">Why are you so positive that she has to die?</string>
  <string id="85940" soundid="137677">The entire place is crumbling! Unless we want to be buried here, we&apos;d better hurry!</string>
  <string id="85942" soundid="161033">It sounds like they were being cautious. Perhaps if you go ask them more specifically about the crystal, they&apos;ll realize that we&apos;re just here to help.</string>
  <string id="85943">Tell me again how Drunken Master style works.</string>
  <string id="85944" soundid="161035">All signs point to the inn, and even if they didn&apos;t mention this missing crystal before, they will have to explain themselves if you confront them about it directly.</string>
  <string id="85945">When I was at the inn, they talked about some plan they had to &quot;deal&quot; with the fox.</string>
  <string id="85947">I&apos;ll go back to the inn and ask them about the missing crystal.</string>
  <string id="85956">I&apos;m not that easily beaten.</string>
  <string id="85957">You... fight dirty!</string>
  <string id="85958">What is the Mother?</string>
  <string id="85959">The cook called you &quot;twisted servants of the Mother.&quot;</string>
  <string id="85961">There&apos;s something wrong in this inn. What&apos;s really going on?</string>
  <string id="85965">You&apos;re right. I&apos;ll find more answers in the forest than I will here.</string>
  <string id="85966">Answer some questions for me about this area.</string>
  <string id="85967">How long has the forest been like this?</string>
  <string id="85969">What is causing the blight in the trees?</string>
  <string id="85971">Do you know of any routes out of the forest?</string>
  <string id="85973">I want to discuss another subject.</string>
  <string id="85974">Tell me more about this inn.</string>
  <string id="85975">How did this place earn its name?</string>
  <string id="85978">Is this inn the property of Lord Yun?</string>
  <string id="85980">With the forest in this state, how have you been surviving?</string>
  <string id="85981">How can you hunt with the forest in its current state?</string>
  <string id="85983">What of rice or vegetables? With no caravans, where do you find them?</string>
  <string id="85985">Let&apos;s talk about something else.</string>
  <string id="85986">I have to go and deal with this forest.</string>
  <string id="85987" soundid="130285">You left more destruction and shattered lives behind you than my wife shopping for a new hat!</string>
  <string id="85988" soundid="130286">I&apos;m clearly going crazy, but I wanted to be here. This... thing, mother, whatever... it has to be destroyed.</string>
  <string id="85989" soundid="130287">Why did you bring the cook? The next time you want things slaughtered, bring me! It&apos;s what I do best.</string>
  <string id="85990" soundid="130288">Spear Catches Leaf told me to look after you while you were in this forest, so let&apos;s see what we can do about this &quot;mother&quot; thing. Sounds like you&apos;ll need all the help you can get.</string>
  <string id="85991" soundid="130289">There&apos;s no way you&apos;re going down there without us. I came here to help you deal with this... &quot;Mother&quot; thing. Spear Catches Leaf told me to look after you, so here I am.</string>
  <string id="85992" soundid="163641">Eh? It&apos;s not like they need any of that anymore! Eh-heh, feel some compassion for them, do you? Maybe you don&apos;t have what it takes to do my job.</string>
  <string id="85993" soundid="130291">Yes, well... it&apos;s obvious you two are fine on your own. I&apos;ll just wait here.</string>
  <string id="85994" soundid="130292">Oh no you don&apos;t! We&apos;ll all go together. Besides, I need you to keep the wine flowing. I&apos;m always more dangerous when I&apos;m drunk.</string>
  <string id="85995" soundid="130293">Well, there&apos;s no turning back now. Who knows how many more cannibals are down there? When you&apos;re ready, let&apos;s finish this Mother off.</string>
  <string id="86001" soundid="163642">Then you&apos;re no better than me! We both just do the best we can with what we&apos;re given, so let&apos;s just leave it at that.</string>
  <string id="86014" soundid="144736">He carried a piece of your amulet. It was separated, broken apart, so your enemies could not find it easily. You have the first piece. It trains your abilities now.</string>
  <string id="86029" soundid="138152">You are weak and impure! You cannot stop the Mother or her people! Die now!</string>
  <string id="86030" soundid="138153">Lies! You are not cannibal or changing like these new ones. You are food!</string>
  <string id="86032">I&apos;m the one who will stop this sickness from spreading.</string>
  <string id="86086" soundid="144737">The second piece fell here with its minder, hidden until waters receded. A guardian protects it, waiting to test and serve you. The third piece awaits discovery in a distant lair.</string>
  <string id="86104">Don&apos;t mind me, I&apos;m just passing through.</string>
  <string id="86105">I am one of your kind!</string>
  <string id="86106" soundid="162511">This is a chance to isolate the leader of the troops! Death&apos;s Hand thinks that he and a group of Assassins will enter the temple unopposed, but I have a surprise.</string>
  <string id="86107" soundid="162512">I set traps... remember how I asked Kang for some of his explosive casks? The Assassins will be destroyed, and Death&apos;s Hand will be yours alone.</string>
  <string id="86160" soundid="130458">This should be fun. If there&apos;s enough of the little guys down there, this could be better than that time I stormed the Fortress of Seven Gates by myself!</string>
  <string id="86163">Dragon Powder</string>
  <string id="86164" soundid="130462">You have come this far. Impressive.</string>
  <string id="86165" soundid="130463">The Water Dragon may wish for you to find her, but I will not lie down and die, even if your death dooms us all.</string>
  <string id="86166" soundid="130464">My death will free the Mother. You... fool.</string>
  <string id="86167" soundid="130465">Neither of us has time to waste, but there is time to talk.</string>
  <string id="86168" soundid="130466">You must destroy my ancient enemy, the Mother. She has infected the people of the inn with her magic and twisted them into monsters. </string>
  <string id="86169" soundid="130467">They infest the caves beneath the Pilgrim&apos;s Rest and will defend their mistress to the death.</string>
  <string id="86170" soundid="130468">If you&apos;re thinking to learn our tricks, you will be disappointed. I&apos;ll happily tell you more of my kind if you wish, though.</string>
  <string id="86171">Dragon Powder</string>
  <string id="86172" soundid="130470">One of my kind might approach you as a wizened sage and ask for aid in studying an ancient artifact. Your response would determine the reaction.</string>
  <string id="86173" soundid="130471">You might expect this generosity to be rewarded, and many who think they are dealing with the fox take exactly this approach. They are fools.</string>
  <string id="86174" soundid="130472">To give without temperance encourages charlatans, liars, and thieves. Had you given that offer to me, I would have taken all you had to teach you a lesson.</string>
  <string id="86175" soundid="130473">Then you would be rewarded in some small way. Perhaps the artifact would be genuine, or the fox would offer you some information she had &quot;learned&quot; from the artifact.</string>
  <string id="86176" soundid="130474">Your response was proper, as you balanced your wealth with the &quot;sage&apos;s&quot; need, but did not do so foolishly.</string>
  <string id="86177" soundid="130475">As someone who had just come into more wealth than you could possibly need, you would be made to suffer in some way.</string>
  <string id="86179" soundid="130477">The fox has a nose for people&apos;s character, and we judge by their intentions as much as their actions.</string>
  <string id="86180" soundid="130478">No. Unlike many of my younger sisters, I am anchored to this place. More free to act upon your world than most spirits because of my connection to the trees.</string>
  <string id="86181" soundid="130479">The Mother is the dark balance to my lighter influence. You will find that most anchors are like that; the heavens maintain balance in all things.</string>
  <string id="86182" soundid="130480">It likely depends on what a fox has done to you. How easy to paint the persecutor as evil and the benefactor as good.</string>
  <string id="86183" soundid="130481">So long as we stay in our place, we foxes are merely servants of heaven. We fill a role few would envy.</string>
  <string id="86184" soundid="130482">Every class of spirit or demon is ordered by the Celestial Bureaucracy. We have our roles and powers, but we also have desires and personalities.</string>
  <string id="86185" soundid="130483">Some rebel against the will of heaven itself and follow their own hearts. Not all of those who do so are &quot;evil&quot; as you&apos;d define it, but they are certainly defiant.</string>
  <string id="86186" soundid="130484">Of course. What do you need?</string>
  <string id="86187" soundid="130485">A most ancient tale, and one long forgotten by your kind. The Mother tried to corrupt this forest once before and failed, leaving herself weakened.</string>
  <string id="86188">Student remains</string>
  <string id="86195">Chi +10

The Spirit Monks have long used the meditation wheels lining the entryway of Dirge&apos;s inner temple to aid their meditations. Three of the wheels spun freely during your meditations, and your spirit feels more in tune with your heritage as a result.</string>
  <string id="86196" soundid="191964"></string>
  <string id="86197" soundid="191965"></string>
  <string id="86200" soundid="191968">The natural order has been disrupted. There is much to say, but first, I was instructed to impart some very specific knowledge. Your Master was very clear.</string>
  <string id="86201" soundid="191969">Zu is an honorable man. Not a good man, perhaps, but an honorable one. Now, to your training; a brief description will reinforce in your mind the style you saw me use.</string>
  <string id="86203" soundid="191970">Certain lessons had to be withheld until you were ready for the attention they will bring. Sun Li taught me so that I would teach you. I must train you in Spirit Thief.</string>
  <string id="86204" soundid="191971">Magic and weapons tire you. Draw on them too much and you could be left defenseless. Spirit Thief restores your chi and focus, prolonging your ability to fight or ignore wounds.</string>
  <string id="86209" soundid="191972">It is especially useful when enemies are immune to basic martial attacks, when you *must* use magic or weapons. Spar with me. I was directed to test you personally.</string>
  <string id="86210" soundid="191973">Magic and weapons tire you. Draw on them too much and you could be left defenseless. Spirit Thief restores your chi, prolonging your ability to fight or ignore wounds.</string>
  <string id="86211" soundid="191974">Magic and weapons tire you. Draw on them too much and you could be left defenseless. Spirit Thief restores you, prolonging your ability to fight or ignore wounds.</string>
  <string id="86212" soundid="191975">It is time to continue your training, and I am honored to add to the basics that Sun Li instilled. A brief description should reinforce the style you saw me use.</string>
  <string id="86213" soundid="191976">Well done. You are quick to learn, as Sun Li said you would be. Speak with me in the Teahouse. We have much to discuss about your master, and how to find him.</string>
  <string id="86214" soundid="130512">As you wish.</string>
  <string id="86215" soundid="130513">Of course.</string>
  <string id="86216" soundid="130514">Shall I send you to the portal back to my temple, or would you prefer to walk among these islands a bit longer?</string>
  <string id="86217" soundid="130515">Breathe deeply. You will find yourself in other places where the air is less pure soon enough.</string>
  <string id="86218" soundid="130516">Time is of the essence. Go safely.</string>
  <string id="86220">What do I need to do to aid you again?</string>
  <string id="86222">Can I ask you some things about fox spirits?</string>
  <string id="86223">I keep hearing about the foxes&apos; tricks. Can you give me an example?</string>
  <string id="86224" soundid="191977">Use Spirit Thief to restore yourself, then you can attack or heal yourself.</string>
  <string id="86225">What if I offered as much money as the &quot;sage&quot; needed?</string>
  <string id="86228">Suppose I gave the &quot;sage&quot; some funds and demanded results. What then?</string>
  <string id="86231">If I turned this &quot;sage&quot; away, what would happen?</string>
  <string id="86234">Are most of your kind tied to nature in some way?</string>
  <string id="86236">Are fox spirits good or evil?</string>
  <string id="86238">What about those who don&apos;t stay in their place?</string>
  <string id="86240">Let&apos;s change the subject.</string>
  <string id="86241">Tell me about the history of your struggle with the Mother.</string>
  <string id="86242">I am always ready to learn.</string>
  <string id="86247">You presume to teach me?</string>
  <string id="86248">Shouldn&apos;t we talk about the Water Dragon or rescuing Master Li?</string>
  <string id="86251">Sagacious Zu</string>
  <string id="86258" soundid="191995"></string>
  <string id="86273">Let&apos;s move on to something else.</string>
  <string id="86274">I should go deal with the inn.</string>
  <string id="86276">I will walk.</string>
  <string id="86277">Send me back to the portal.</string>
  <string id="86278" soundid="144768"></string>
  <string id="86281" soundid="137684">You know, it looks a lot smaller from the outside.</string>
  <string id="86282" soundid="137685">This is no way to treat an honored foe. A clean death is reward for a good fight lost.</string>
  <string id="86283" soundid="137686">That wasn&apos;t so hard. A shame we have to kill him, he was great at supplying us enemies!</string>
  <string id="86315">Door</string>
  <string id="86316" soundid="144769"></string>
  <string id="86320" soundid="137693">This place is too pretty for my tastes. Where is the stench of old blood and young wine that should hang in the air like the ghost of yesterday&apos;s supper?</string>
  <string id="86321" soundid="137694">Now this place suits my tastes. This floor is no stranger to blood and bile.</string>
  <string id="86322" soundid="137695">I hope they serve more than just tea in there.</string>
  <string id="86327" soundid="137700">This place stinks of the dead... moldy, soggy, rust-up-my-axes dead.</string>
  <string id="86329">Door</string>

  <string id="86596" soundid="131187">No, no! You have sided with the Spirit! We had thought her dead, but her stink is on you!</string>
  <string id="86597" soundid="131188">You will pay for your lies! You will suffer for your deception!</string>
  <string id="86598" soundid="131189">You fool! You do not know our true nature! You know nothing of the power we possess! Look upon us now, and see your doom!</string>
  <string id="86599" soundid="131190">This is what you have turned away from! And for what? A fox?</string>
  <string id="86604" soundid="190046">Do not feel bad, she is responsible for her own health and accidents in the ring can happen. I just pray that my decision to let the two of you spar has not crippled her.</string>
  <string id="86611">Spirit Thief is very important. It does no damage, but transfers chi from the enemy to you. If you run out of chi, use spirit thief to restore your abilities. With Spirit Thief you can use magic styles or healing almost indefinitely!</string>
  <string id="86613">Use Spirit Thief to drain all of Hui&apos;s chi, restoring your own!</string>
  <string id="86688" soundid="135879">If I&apos;m lucky, I would lose my lands. If not, my life could very well be forfeit.</string>
  <string id="86689" soundid="135880">What did you need to know?</string>
  <string id="86690" soundid="135881">In the past, you could make your way out of Tien&apos;s Landing through a different path and travel along a highway to reach the city.</string>
  <string id="86697" soundid="135882">That route has been closed for some time now. Even if we cleared it, the forest and highway are plagued with spirits.</string>
  <string id="86698" soundid="135883">Even I had to make my way here using a flyer from the Imperial City. The land route is closed for all intents and purposes.</string>
  <string id="86699" soundid="135884">I certainly came here by flyer. It was the only way.</string>
  <string id="86746">Henpecked Hou</string>
  <string id="86749">Black Whirlwind</string>
  <string id="86763">Pirate Guard</string>
  <string id="86768" soundid="131427">The trees began to blacken when the ghosts appeared. I&apos;m certain the two are connected. What worries me is that the Forest Shadow may somehow be involved.</string>
  <string id="86770">Once you gain a level, remember to press the &lt;Menu&gt; key to level your character up.</string>
  <string id="86820" soundid="131479">Nice job. I&apos;d spit on Fang&apos;s corpse, but he&apos;s not worth the effort. Too bad about his guards, though. They really weren&apos;t that bad.</string>
  <string id="86821" soundid="131480">I... I appreciate this, you know. Fang was... he was evil. Pure evil. He kept me blinded with silver, and I just never realized how horrible my life was.</string>
  <string id="86822" soundid="131481">Well... that is a lot of silver. And I&apos;d love to get out from under Fang&apos;s boot heel.</string>
  <string id="86823" soundid="131482">I&apos;ll help you. You wanted Fang dead, right?</string>
  <string id="86824" soundid="131483">It&apos;d be easier to kill him. Fang&apos;s reputation is already as dirty as it can get. As long as it doesn&apos;t get in the way of his job, everybody just turns a blind eye.</string>
  <string id="86825" soundid="131484">Well, every document Judge Fang approves has to be stamped with his Imperial Ring. Losing the ring is a major offense.</string>
  <string id="86826" soundid="131485">And if it was revealed he lost the ring during one of his sexual escapades... even Fang wouldn&apos;t want that to come out.</string>
  <string id="86827" soundid="131486"></string>
  <string id="86828" soundid="131487">What are you doing here, Breezes? You know I don&apos;t like it when people see us together in public.</string>
  <string id="86829" soundid="131488">Don&apos;t be mad, my mighty and manly Fang. I was just hoping we could go upstairs for a bit. I&apos;ve got a treat for you. Here&apos;s a hint: they&apos;re silk.</string>
  <string id="86830" soundid="131489">I&apos;m surprised you&apos;re so eager after last night. I&apos;m glad to see you&apos;re finally becoming more receptive to my... special needs.</string>
  <string id="86831" soundid="131490"></string>
  <string id="86832" soundid="131491">Well done, Breezes... if a little tame for my tastes. I think tonight you should wear the blindfold. I have some interesting surprises in store for you.</string>
  <string id="86833" soundid="131492">I... I can hardly wait, oh great and virile Fang.</string>
  <string id="86834" soundid="131493"></string>
  <string id="86835" soundid="131494">Here&apos;s the ring. Fang will do anything to keep people from finding out he lost it to a whore... even if it means resigning his post.</string>
  <string id="86836" soundid="131495">Show the ring to his guards and they&apos;ll let you through. I better disappear for a while, but make sure you tell him where you got it. He&apos;ll be sorry he ever touched me!</string>
  <string id="86837" soundid="131496">Good, that&apos;s what I like to hear. But we can&apos;t do it here in front of everyone. We need someplace more private. Like the animal pens down below.</string>
  <string id="86838" soundid="131497">An exotic locale should excite him. I&apos;ll lure him down there, then you follow. </string>
  <string id="86839" soundid="131498">If you&apos;re lucky, the guards won&apos;t notice you slip down after us, but I don&apos;t know. Those men are well paid to look after Fang.</string>
  <string id="86840" soundid="131499"></string>
  <string id="86841" soundid="131500">Breezes, I&apos;m surprised. I thought you&apos;d be avoiding me after last night. You didn&apos;t seem to enjoy it very much.</string>
  <string id="86842" soundid="131501">Uh... no, great and mighty Fang. I... I liked it. In fact, I was hoping we could try it again. Right now. Down below.</string>
  <string id="86843" soundid="131502">In the animal pens? Oh, Breezes... you are such a filthy girl!</string>
  <string id="86844" soundid="131503"></string>
  <string id="86845" soundid="131504">Fang, hold on a moment. I have a special surprise for you.</string>
  <string id="86846" soundid="131505">How unexpected, Breezes. You&apos;re not usually the type to come up with new activities for us. What sort of filthy thing do you have in mind down here?</string>
  <string id="86847" soundid="131506">You like pain, so you should love this, Fang! I&apos;ve brought you someone who&apos;s going to make sure you suffer for what you&apos;ve done to me!</string>
  <string id="86848" soundid="131507">Hey, what are you doing down here? What&apos;s going on?</string>
  <string id="86849" soundid="131508">Attack, you fools! The whore has led us into a trap!</string>
  <string id="86850" soundid="131509">Don&apos;t worry about that. One thing I&apos;ve learned from my time with Fang is how to block things out.</string>
  <string id="86851" soundid="131510">Judge Fang won&apos;t like it, but the worst he can do is rough me up a little tonight. The bastard might do that anyway... or make me rough him up. Sometimes that&apos;s worse.</string>
  <string id="86852" soundid="131511">I hate him! He&apos;s a vile, repulsive deviant! He likes to hurt. When things are bad, a man like that leaves scars. Emotional and physical.</string>
  <string id="86853" soundid="131512">Look, I&apos;ve been around. I know people do strange and disturbing things behind locked doors. But nothing like this.</string>
  <string id="86854" soundid="131513">There&apos;s no act too brutal or shameful for Judge Fang. He&apos;s into all sorts of things, and he&apos;s no stranger to pain. I know that all too well.</string>
  <string id="86855" soundid="131514">I&apos;ve thought about quitting. Every night. But I heard what happened to the last girl who tried to leave Fang. He&apos;s not the kind of man you just walk away from.</string>
  <string id="86856" soundid="131515">He... he sees me as a possession. *His* possession. He&apos;s not just going to let me go. He&apos;s got the wealth and power to find me wherever I run.</string>
  <string id="86857" soundid="131516">I&apos;m stuck with Judge Fang until he&apos;s tired of me. I&apos;ve come to accept that. It&apos;s a hard, grim fact, but at least he pays well.</string>
  <string id="86858" soundid="131517">Go ahead. It&apos;s not like I&apos;m going to tell you anything that isn&apos;t common knowledge.</string>
  <string id="86859" soundid="131518">Fang&apos;s head of the Ministry of Harmony, so he controls taxes and executions across the Empire. That makes him a very rich and powerful man.</string>
  <string id="86860" soundid="131519">Even the Lotus Assassins are wary of Judge Fang. Probably because they know he&apos;s just as vile and corrupt as they are. All the rumors about him are true.</string>
  <string id="86861" soundid="131520">He&apos;s the most infamous degenerate in the Imperial City... and I work for him.</string>
  <string id="86862" soundid="131521">Good, let me rest. I&apos;ve got a feeling I&apos;m in for a long night tonight.</string>
  <string id="86863" soundid="131522">Now that he&apos;s dead, I finally realize what I have become... what he made me. I just... I just hope I can put all this behind me.</string>
  <string id="86864" soundid="131523">Yeah, you&apos;re right. I think... I think things are going to work out. Thank you.</string>
  <string id="86865" soundid="131524">Once a whore, always a whore, is that it? You&apos;re nothing but a heartless bastard! You&apos;re no better than Fang!</string>
  <string id="86866" soundid="131525">Don&apos;t judge me! If you were starving on the street, you&apos;d sell your body just like I had to! You&apos;re no better than I am, you heartless bitch!</string>
  <string id="86867" soundid="131526">What? No... you can&apos;t kill me. Not now. Not when I&apos;m finally free of Fang! No... no!</string>
  <string id="86868" soundid="131527">I&apos;m not really in the mood for company. Judge Fang wanted to try something special last night, and I still haven&apos;t quite recovered yet.</string>
  <string id="86869" soundid="131528">Sorry, big boy. I&apos;m not open for business. Judge Fang&apos;s got me on his payroll, and he doesn&apos;t like me taking customers on the side.</string>
  <string id="86870" soundid="131529">Forget it, lady. I stick with male clients, and right now I&apos;m on Judge Fang&apos;s payroll. He doesn&apos;t like me branching out to make money on the side.</string>
  <string id="86871" soundid="131530">Unless you&apos;re into something twisted. Then he might want to watch. Fang&apos;s always looking for some new perversion to make his little soldier stand at attention.</string>
  <string id="86872" soundid="131531">My name is Gentle Breezes, but everyone just calls me Breezes now. I guess you lose your gentle side when you spend too many nights with Judge Fang.</string>
  <string id="86873" soundid="131532">Fang&apos;s my... benefactor, if you know what I mean. I do all the things that make him happy. Filthy, nasty things. But at least that sick bastard pays well.</string>
  <string id="86874" soundid="131533">Judge Fang&apos;s the head of the Ministry of Harmony. He&apos;s sitting in the next room with his guards. Likes to come and watch the arena fights.</string>
  <string id="86875" soundid="131534">The blood and beatings in the ring get his fever burning for later. Sometimes that bastard takes it out on me. Other times he makes me take it out on him.</string>
  <string id="86876" soundid="131535">He doesn&apos;t seem to care either way. There are few things more twisted than Judge Fang&apos;s idea of a fun night.</string>
  <string id="86877" soundid="131536">Get rid of him? What do you mean? Remove him from office or... something else?</string>
  <string id="86878" soundid="131537">Really? I was hoping you wanted to kill him. The world would be a better place with that disgusting pig dead and buried!</string>
  <string id="86879" soundid="131538">Good! I hate that disgusting pig. Nobody knows the depths of his perversions better than I. The world will be a better place when he&apos;s dead and buried. </string>
  <string id="86880" soundid="131539">But as much as I want to see his bloated corpse floating in the gutter... Fang is a dangerous man and he keeps my pockets lined with silver.</string>
  <string id="86881" soundid="131540">I hope Fang gets what he deserves, but you&apos;ll have to do it without my help.</string>
  <string id="86882" soundid="131541">[Success] It would be nice to get rid of him. No more debasing myself for that repulsive toad.</string>
  <string id="86883" soundid="131542">[Failure] No. Even if I was willing to give up all that silver, if Fang finds out, he&apos;ll make sure I spend the rest of my days begging for death. It&apos;s not worth the risk.</string>
  <string id="86884" soundid="131543">[Success] You&apos;re right. He&apos;s treated me worse than a dog. It&apos;s time he learned I&apos;m still strong enough to stand up to him!</string>
  <string id="86885" soundid="131544">[Success] Don&apos;t... don&apos;t hurt me. Fang&apos;s already hurt me too many times and I won&apos;t let him hurt me again!</string>
  <string id="86886" soundid="131545">[Failure] You think threats will work on me? You obviously don&apos;t know the depths of Fang&apos;s creativity.</string>
  <string id="86889">[Intimidation] Help me with Fang, and I won&apos;t break your legs.</string>
  <string id="86891">Here&apos;s nine hundred silver if you help me.</string>
  <string id="86893">No. I just want to ruin him.</string>
  <string id="86894">There&apos;s got to be some way to bring him down.</string>
  <string id="86896">Bring me the ring and I&apos;ll blackmail him into resigning.</string>
  <string id="86907">Let&apos;s just kill him.</string>
  <string id="86908">Yes. I want him dead.</string>
  <string id="86911">Don&apos;t worry about the guards. I can handle them.</string>
  <string id="86912">Lure him down there. I&apos;ll follow you.</string>
  <string id="86916">Some enemies are so powerful that they are immune to certain types of attacks. If an enemy seems immune to the style you&apos;re using, try switching to a different type of style (Martial, Support, Weapon, Magic, or Transformation).</string>
  <string id="86923">Fine. Forget I said anything.</string>
  <string id="86924">I want to ask you some questions.</string>
  <string id="86925">You don&apos;t like Fang much, do you?</string>
  <string id="86928">Why do you work for him?</string>
  <string id="86931">I want to ask you something else.</string>
  <string id="86932">Tell me more about Judge Fang.</string>
  <string id="86935">Goodbye.</string>
  <string id="86936">The past is behind you. You&apos;ve got a fresh start now.</string>
  <string id="86938">Right. You&apos;ll bed the next guy who flashes a few coins at you.</string>
  <string id="86941">Sorry, but I don&apos;t leave witnesses behind.</string>
  <string id="86945">Who are you?</string>
  <string id="86947">Who is Judge Fang?</string>
  <string id="86950">I want you to help me get rid of Fang.</string>
  <string id="86951">I want to ruin his career.</string>
  <string id="86953">I want him dead.</string>
  <string id="86956">[Intuition] With Fang gone you can finally be free.</string>

  <string id="86962" soundid="173932">I... I think we should go back to the Temple. And quickly, before those flyers drop more Lotus Assassins.</string>
  <string id="86963">What were you saying before about the forest?</string>
  <string id="86969">You hear things?</string>
  <string id="86983">I already know the forest is haunted.</string>

  <string id="86991" soundid="131655">That almost hurt! You&apos;re going to regret that!</string>

  <string id="86993" soundid="131657">Keep it away from me!</string>
  <string id="86994" soundid="131658">Kill it! Kill it!</string>
  <string id="86995" soundid="131659">Is that it? Is that it? You call that a punch?</string>
  <string id="86996" soundid="131660">Oh, I know you didn&apos;t aim that kick at me!</string>
  <string id="87001" soundid="131665">I... I&apos;m sorry. I had no choice. He.. he promised me my daughter back if I helped him, and you... you are no better than those we fight.</string>
  <string id="87002" soundid="138432">That name... means nothing. I am the will of the Emperor. I am Death&apos;s Hand. Sun Li commands that you die. I must obey.</string>

  <string id="87004" soundid="131668">He&apos;s an arrogant one. I doubt he&apos;d consider the possibility that my loyalty to you would be stronger than my fear of him. The bell was the signal. He&apos;ll be here.</string>
  <string id="87005" soundid="131669">Thank you for this opportunity, by the way. I could never face Death&apos;s Hand myself, but I want to make him pay for thinking I would be so weak.</string>

  <string id="87025">Your master is not here. What do you want, Prince Kin?</string>
  <string id="87027">Then fight as you must, but you will not defeat me.</string>

  <string id="87030">I have lost too much to you and your master. No more!</string>
  <string id="87031">You are a shell, a shadow. Let us see how fearsome you are!</string>
  <string id="87032">Didn&apos;t I leave you buried in the dirt somewhere?</string>
  <string id="87033">I don&apos;t fear you. All you can do is kill me, and I&apos;ve already been there.</string>
  <string id="87082" soundid="165542">Oh, I don&apos;t know. They&apos;re good with knots.</string>
  <string id="87090" soundid="165543">Coming from you, that&apos;s a tempting offer. I&apos;m a fool to turn you down, but I think what I&apos;ve come here to do is something I must do alone.</string>
  <string id="87094" soundid="131764">Do not expect any help from the Lotus Assassins with this task. You will have to prove you can succeed on your own before we will even consider you for our organization.</string>
  <string id="87095" soundid="131765">There will be no questions. I have already given you all the information you need to succeed. Now you are on your own.</string>
  <string id="87096" soundid="131766">Perhaps, perhaps not. In any case, I wish you luck in your endeavor.</string>
  <string id="87097" soundid="131767">Remember, don&apos;t let Sheng give his report to Judge Fang. We will be watching you from afar. Once you have completed your task, I will meet you back here.</string>
  <string id="87099" soundid="131769">You know, far be it from me to presume, but I have an idea of how we might be able to solve this problem.</string>
  <string id="87100" soundid="131770">My glorious wife&apos;s third cousin is a minor official in the Ministry of Harmony. I know a little something of the way Judge Fang conducts his business.</string>
  <string id="87101" soundid="131771">Yes, of course, I do not mean to incur your wrath but... it&apos;s only that I know something of the way the Ministry of Harmony does business.</string>
  <string id="87102" soundid="131772">All of Fang&apos;s ministers bring him an honor gift when they go to see him... an offering given as a sign of respect. A... a bribe, some might call it.</string>
  <string id="87103" soundid="131773">If we replace Sheng&apos;s honor gift with something insulting--rare turtle eggs, for example--Fang would be so outraged he&apos;d refuse to even listen to Sheng&apos;s report!</string>
  <string id="87104" soundid="131774">It&apos;s true. A gift of turtle eggs would be as insulting as a box of manure. Even more so because they are so difficult to track down, whereas manure is somewhat common.</string>
  <string id="87105" soundid="144094">That is the beauty of what Sun Hai has done. He has taken the raw material of the Empire and extracted something useful.</string>
  <string id="87106" soundid="131776">I admit there are still some details yet to be worked out, but acquiring the eggs is easy. I have some here that you can simply have.</string>
  <string id="87107" soundid="131777">We should just kill Sheng. Nice and simple. Kill his guards, too.</string>
  <string id="87108" soundid="131778">Yes. And while we&apos;re at it, we could kill Fang. And his guards, too. Unleash rivers of blood in the streets, all in the service of the Lotus Assassins!</string>
  <string id="87109" soundid="131779">Now that is how you interrupt the bureaucratic process! I&apos;m all for it!</string>
  <string id="87110" soundid="131780">I am no coward, but there is already more blood on my hands than I can ever wash clean. You know this.</string>
  <string id="87111" soundid="131781">I have no plan for you... no easy answer. But working with the Lotus Assassins is a bad idea. No good can ever come of it.</string>
  <string id="87112" soundid="131782">We really don&apos;t have any choice, Zu. It&apos;s the only way we&apos;ll ever rescue Master Li. But I don&apos;t like the idea of causing trouble for Sheng.</string>
  <string id="87113" soundid="131783">Maybe you&apos;re right, Dawn Star. I just hope that in the end we don&apos;t sacrifice everything for the sake of one man, even if he is your... your beloved Master Li.</string>
  <string id="87114" soundid="131784">My spies tell me that Judge Fang has resigned. Is this true?</string>
  <string id="87115" soundid="131785">However, you did take the shortest path to accomplish your goal. Killing Sheng is a task more suited to a back-alley thug than an Inquisitor.</string>
  <string id="87116" soundid="131786">I&apos;ve been out spying on the Lotus Assassins. We&apos;re trying to draw their attention, and I wanted to see if it was working.</string>
  <string id="87117" soundid="131787">I&apos;m happy to report our bait has snagged a fish. The Inquisitors have taken notice of us. In fact, one of their representatives is on his way here now.</string>
  <string id="87118" soundid="131788">You were spying on an Inquisitor, and he didn&apos;t notice you? Impossible! What&apos;s really going on, Sky? Where were you?</string>
  <string id="87119" soundid="131789">It&apos;s like I told you before: I was spying on the Lotus Assassins. At great personal risk, I might add! Instead of interrogating me, you could show me some gratitude.</string>
  <string id="87120" soundid="131790">The Inquisitors are masters of espionage and intrigue, Sky. They would have seen you tailing them. They would have seen you and killed you!</string>
  <string id="87121" soundid="131791">You underestimate me. I can be quite invisible when necessary. I followed the Inquisitor for some time without him being aware of my presence.</string>
  <string id="87122" soundid="131792">Then I slipped away and rushed on ahead to warn you he was coming. I didn&apos;t want him to catch us in the middle of anything incriminating... like this argument.</string>
  <string id="87123" soundid="131793"></string>
  <string id="87124" soundid="131794"></string>
  <string id="87125" soundid="131795">But your point is well taken. You have shown some inkling of promise merely by drawing our attention... but that alone is hardly proof of your worth.</string>
  <string id="87126" soundid="131796">Obviously we require some type of test, some proof of loyalty before any can join. You must prove yourself useful to us before we will even consider you.</string>
  <string id="87127" soundid="131797">Such confidence must be the mark of great skill... or foolish bravado. Rest assured, we will determine which in due course. </string>
  <string id="87128" soundid="131798">There is a small problem I intended to deal with. A minor annoyance, but one that should prove a good test of your value to our organization.</string>
  <string id="87129" soundid="131799">Judge Fang of the Ministry of Harmony has made a habit of openly defying our order. In the past we have tolerated him, as few pay his accusations any heed.</string>
  <string id="87130" soundid="131800">Judge Fang has a rather... unsavory... reputation. Because of his degenerate appetites, most have dismissed his warnings out of hand. Until now.</string>
  <string id="87131" soundid="131801">A certain Minister named Sheng is coming to make his annual report. Sheng has information about certain... activities... of our group we wish to keep from the public.</string>
  <string id="87132" soundid="131802">If Judge Fang learns of these activities from Sheng&apos;s report, he may have enough evidence to cause real problems for us. We would have to take drastic action.</string>
  <string id="87135">I&apos;ll pass any test you dream up!</string>
  <string id="87139">So what&apos;s changed?</string>
  <string id="87140">Why bother with him, then?</string>
  <string id="87143">You want me to kill Sheng?</string>
  <string id="87144">You want me to kill Judge Fang?</string>
  <string id="87145">You want me to steal that report?</string>
  <string id="87147">What do you want me to do?</string>
  <string id="87150">I will not fail you.</string>
  <string id="87151">Wait, I have some questions.</string>
  <string id="87153">This will be easy.</string>
  <string id="87156">Spirit Font</string>
  <string id="87157">What&apos;s your plan?</string>
  <string id="87159">Forget it.</string>
  <string id="87162">Turtle eggs? Are you serious?</string>
  <string id="87164">Where are we going to find turtle eggs?</string>
  <string id="87165">I&apos;ll keep that in mind.</string>
  <string id="87166" soundid="144095">But through all this, a threat remained: a traitorous sibling and a hidden protege. We did not know a face or a name, but we knew what they would need.</string>
  <string id="87167">That&apos;s a stupid plan.</string>
  <string id="87171">I think Zu was being sarcastic.</string>
  <string id="87172">So what&apos;s your plan, Zu?</string>
  <string id="87173">What&apos;s the matter, Zu? Scared of a little blood?</string>
  <string id="87177" soundid="139384">Her name, they said, was a testament to her ability to move between the trees in utter silence, observing all that happened in this place without ever being detected.</string>
  <string id="87180">A good question. Where did you go, Sky?</string>
  <string id="87182">Relax. Sky told us where he was.</string>
  <string id="87183">Knock it off! The Inquisitor could be here any minute.</string>
  <string id="87184" soundid="156838">Watch and learn.</string>
  <string id="87186">He&apos;s right. Just drop it.</string>
  <string id="87187">This isn&apos;t over, Sky.</string>
  <string id="87188">Enough. I think I hear someone coming.</string>
  <string id="87194">How can I prove my worth, honorable Master?</string>
  <string id="87195">What do you want me to do?</string>
  <string id="87197">The Lotus Assassins don&apos;t want Fang to see that report.</string>
  <string id="87200">What are you suggesting?</string>
  <string id="87201">You want me to kill Judge Fang?</string>
  <string id="87256">Ministry Hostel</string>
  <string id="87257" soundid="166111">Let&apos;s go. I&apos;m sure Hou can make his way back to Tien&apos;s Landing. Even if there&apos;s more cannibals about, he&apos;s too skinny to eat.</string>
  <string id="87259">The Golden Way</string>
  <string id="88130" soundid="135885">You should really make your way out of this place. This once lovely forest is lost, I think. The ghosts have made it unfit for the rest of us.</string>
  <string id="88131" soundid="135886">Help me? That&apos;s certainly a kind offer, but I&apos;m not sure that anyone....</string>
  <string id="88132" soundid="135887">I would highly recommend that course of action. This place is not safe, even for one of your considerable skills.</string>
  <string id="88148" soundid="135888">Wait a moment. You don&apos;t look like a pilgrim or one of the poor folk trying to escape Tien&apos;s Landing. Would it be out of line to inquire as to what brought you here?</string>
  <string id="88149" soundid="135889">Lotus Assassins? You have picked a dangerous quarry. Compounding the problem, they likely took him to the Imperial City.</string>
  <string id="88150" soundid="135890">The Imperial City, is it? How interesting. You find yourself in a tricky predicament. There are few ways to reach the capital from here. Air would be your best bet.</string>
  <string id="88178" soundid="135891">Trust me when I say that there is no safe land route to the north. This path is barely passable, and the forest is crawling with ghosts. </string>
  <string id="88179" soundid="135892">Even caravans employing skilled warriors have been forced to turn back under these ghosts&apos; assaults. I could only reach Tien&apos;s Landing by using my flyer.</string>
  <string id="88180" soundid="135893">The new supplies and men that are being gathered were going to be used to restore the highway.</string>
  <string id="88198" soundid="134090">The same power that held the outer gates shut keeps these locked, as well. We must restore the nearby fountain to open them.</string>
  <string id="88201" soundid="137704">Never trust a thief. You think they&apos;re on your side, but they&apos;ll slit your throat and take your silver.</string>

  <string id="88232" soundid="137735">Here is the source as she was laid open. She is a trophy representing all that we accomplished. Her power bleeds to feed an Empire.</string>
  <string id="88233" soundid="137736">Brother Li awaits. The first battle was to test your resolve and abilities. He is ever the Glorious Strategist.</string>
  <string id="88258" soundid="137761">I can&apos;t believe they&apos;ve moved so quickly. We need your weapon. Gujin will be in his shop north of the main stairs.</string>
  <string id="88259" soundid="137762">I can hear fighting to the east! We have to push these bandits back off the beach!</string>
  <string id="88260" soundid="137763">There&apos;s something... not right. This place feels all wrong. The forest is the same, but it&apos;s stronger here.</string>
  <string id="88261" soundid="137764">This is nightmarish... we have to finish this any way we can.</string>
  <string id="88263" soundid="137766">The forest had a mournful feeling to it, but there&apos;s none of that here. If this is the Forest Shadow&apos;s home, she can&apos;t be behind the sickness in the trees.</string>
  <string id="88266" soundid="137769">Look at this place... so many people. This truly is the heart of the Empire.</string>
  <string id="88267" soundid="137770">The busy streets are almost overwhelming. It is hard to keep focused on what we need to do.</string>
  <string id="88268" soundid="137771">Is... is this a school? It is so much bigger than what we had in Two Rivers.</string>
  <string id="88269" soundid="137772">Shouldn&apos;t visiting ministers have more... dignified accommodations?</string>
  <string id="88270" soundid="134162">This... this cannot be! Is it really possible? I... I sense the mark of the Water Dragon upon you. You have returned!</string>
  <string id="88271" soundid="134163">You don&apos;t recognize me? No, of course not. You were just an infant when you were taken from us.</string>
  <string id="88272" soundid="134164">I am the spirit of Abbot Song, slain many years ago by the Glorious Strategist. Before my death, I was the head of the Spirit Monk order... your order.</string>
  <string id="88273" soundid="134165">Master Li? He is Sun Li the traitor! How out of balance the world has become when one of our order believes Sun Li to be his Master!</string>
  <string id="88274" soundid="134166">I am. I was. But I only led them to defeat and destruction. I failed in my duty to protect the Water Dragon... a duty I would one day have passed to you.</string>
  <string id="88275" soundid="134167">Yes, this is Dirge, once the home of the Spirit Monks, a holy order devoted to serving the Water Dragon... now reduced to tainted ruins.</string>
  <string id="88276" soundid="134168">You are a Spirit Monk, born here in Dirge and cleansed in the sacred fountains. You were an infant the day the Emperor and Sun Li attacked our monastery.</string>
  <string id="88277" soundid="134169">I tried to save you from the slaughter, only to lose you to Li when he ripped you from the arms of your dying guardian.</string>
  <string id="88278" soundid="134170">I can only imagine what lies and distortions he told you about Dirge, your heritage, and his own role in events here. But now, you deserve to hear the truth.</string>
  <string id="88280" soundid="134172">Thirty years ago, the Long Drought struck the land. For a decade, crops withered and died. Starving people across the Empire demanded that something be done.</string>
  <string id="88281" soundid="134173">Despite his position, Emperor Sun Hai could not alter the natural order. He demanded that his brother, the Glorious Strategist, concoct a plan to rectify this insult.</string>

  <string id="88304">The Land of Spirits</string>
  <string id="88305">The Abbot knows of a gem of power located in the western section of the inner courtyard, near the old residences. You will need it to confront the strange presence that now corrupts Dirge. It is likely guarded by many spirits, but the benefits outweigh the risks.</string>
  <string id="88306">Gem of Power</string>
  <string id="88307">Find the Abbot in Dirge</string>
  <string id="88308">Find Abbot Song in Dirge and seek his help.</string>
  <string id="88309">The Water Dragon confirmed Master Li&apos;s betrayal. He used you to acquire the power he and his brother stole. In the gap between Sun Hai&apos;s death and Sun Li claiming power, the Water Dragon was able to bring your spirit to Dirge. You must try to find Abbot Song, one of the Spirit Monks trapped in Dirge. He will help restore the Water Dragon to the point where she can restore you to life.</string>
  <string id="88311">Restore the Fountains of Dirge</string>
  <string id="88312">Find and destroy the guardians, and restore each of the fountains.</string>
  <string id="88313">Abbot Song has joined you. He told of how the fountains of Dirge were corrupted by his fellow monks, allowing Sun Li and the Emperor to overrun the temple. You must defeat the guardians and then restore each of the fountains. This will restore some of the Water Dragon&apos;s power so she can restore you to life.</string>
  <string id="88315" soundid="134207">The guardian of this fountain is destroyed... and I weep for her. She was once one of our order, but, lured by Li&apos;s promises of wealth and power, she betrayed us.</string>
  <string id="88316" soundid="134208">This... thing... is the corrupted spirit of Xian Wu. During the attack, she and several other Spirit Monks betrayed us by tainting the holy fountains with human blood.</string>
  <string id="88317" soundid="134209">The seals on the fountains were broken, and the Water Dragon was crippled. If not for this betrayal, Dirge would never have fallen. Li must have known this.</string>
  <string id="88318" soundid="134210">Long before the attack, Li sent spies to bribe some of our... weaker members. When they tainted the fountains, the power sustaining us against the army vanished.</string>
  <string id="88319" soundid="134211">Xian Wu&apos;s betrayal is... a great shame. I knew her well and considered her a friend. I never imagined she could turn on me like this.</string>
  <string id="88320" soundid="134212">We Spirit Monks are guided by honor and duty; these values are ingrained in us from birth. I never imagined one of our own could betray us.</string>
  <string id="88321" soundid="134213">After the battle, the Emperor executed Xian Wu and the others, and he used the power of the Water Dragon to bind their spirits to the fountains.</string>
  <string id="88322" soundid="134214">Their crime was terrible, but they did not deserve this fate. They suffered endless torment from which they could never escape. Such is the power of the binding.</string>
  <string id="88323" soundid="134215">The binding is a sacred ritual of the Spirit Monks. We can draw on the power of the Water Dragon to bind a spirit to us. It is one of our tools for shepherding the dead.</string>
  <string id="88324" soundid="134216">Even before Dirge was befouled, there were ghosts in the world. Some spirits would become lost in their journey here or refuse to let go of the mortal world and go mad.</string>
  <string id="88325" soundid="134217">If we found one of these restless ghosts, we could bind it to us and bring it to Dirge. Then we would release the spirit so the Water Dragon could lead it into the afterlife.</string>
  <string id="88326" soundid="134218">The binding is a great gift from the Water Dragon, if used properly. But the power can be abused. The Emperor bound the traitors not to himself, but to a place.</string>
  <string id="88327" soundid="134219">A spirit can never escape such a binding. It feels an inexorable pull, but it has nowhere to go. It feels a compulsion to obey, but it is never given a command.</string>
  <string id="88328" soundid="134220">The spirit twists and corrupts, and in its agony, it goes mad. Binding a spirit to a place is a terrible crime for our order. The only thing worse is binding a living creature.</string>
  <string id="88329" soundid="134221">Binding the living condemns them to a fate worse than death. It forces the subject to obey and robs them of their free will. As a Spirit Monk, you must never do such a thing.</string>
  <string id="88330" soundid="134222">The ability to bind spirits comes from the essence of the Water Dragon inside you. You may not have the power now, but one day you will be able to call upon it when needed.</string>
  <string id="88331" soundid="134223">But this is not the time for lessons or instruction. The guardian is dead, but you must place the seal on the fountain for it to be fully restored.</string>
  <string id="88332" soundid="134224">You have nothing to fear here. Though many dangerous beings dwell in Dirge, these monks and soldiers cannot harm you.</string>
  <string id="88333" soundid="134225">The monks and soldiers who fell during the battle are trapped here in Dirge, caught in a never-ending war. They fight, they fall, only to rise and fall again.</string>
  <string id="88334" soundid="134226">I have tried to help my brethren in this battle, but they neither see nor hear me. I cannot aid or lead them. Even in death, I fail them... just as I did in life.</string>
  <string id="88335" soundid="134227">I cannot say. Perhaps because I was the abbot of this monastery. Or maybe because of my death and what happened shortly after.</string>
  <string id="88336" soundid="134228">I made many mistakes during the attack. I was not prepared for the treachery from within, and it led to our downfall. Even after my death, I made poor choices.</string>
  <string id="88337" soundid="134229">Li cut me down on the steps of the temple. My body fell, and my spirit rose. Powerless, I fled toward the outer courtyard while the battle still raged.</string>
  <string id="88338" soundid="134230">I wanted to see if you had escaped. Instead, I saw Li take you... and I found myself trapped out here. The Emperor had sealed the gates behind me.</string>
  <string id="88339" soundid="134231">My spirit cannot leave Dirge. None of the spirits here can leave. For twenty years I have been trapped in the outer courtyard, unable to pass through the gates.</string>
  <string id="88340" soundid="134232">Maybe if I had been inside, I could have saved the Spirit Monks from this endless war. Or maybe I would have been caught up in it with them. I cannot say.</string>
  <string id="88341" soundid="134233">My hope is that the restoration of the fountain will allow the gates to open. Perhaps inside we can find a way to restore Dirge and free my brethren from this curse.</string>
  <string id="88342" soundid="134234">I cannot say what fate lies ahead. But after twenty years, your return gives me reason to hope once more. </string>
  <string id="88343" soundid="134235">Li has trained you in his own image: selfish and oblivious to the suffering of others. Yet I know the Water Dragon believes in you, and I will not lose hope. Not now.</string>
  <string id="88344" soundid="134236">The second fountain is here, but the seal is missing! This could only be possible if the guardian bound to this fountain has been destroyed.</string>
  <string id="88345" soundid="134237">This is... troubling. I feel a foul taint here. Something worse than the corruption of the Emperor. Something older... something not of this realm.</string>
  <string id="88346" soundid="134238">The guardians were powerful beings. Whatever destroyed them must be even stronger... perhaps some monstrosity drawn to this realm by the corruption of Dirge.</string>
  <string id="88347" soundid="134239">Bravery often comes from ignorance. If I am afraid, it is only because I know enough to realize what we may be up against.</string>
  <string id="88348" soundid="134240">There are unnamed things barred from entering both the mortal world and the spirit realm. But with the Water Dragon gone, such a being may have crossed into Dirge.</string>
  <string id="88349" soundid="134241">Such a creature would be drawn to the corruption of the fountain. It must have destroyed the guardian and hidden the seal so the fountain could never be restored.</string>
  <string id="88350" soundid="134242">The creature would not go far... wait! Do you feel that? Something is coming.</string>
  <string id="88351" soundid="196855">Yes? Is there something you need?</string>
  <string id="88358" soundid="134250">Yes? Is there something you need? I will gladly do all that I can to help you restore the fountains of Dirge.</string>
  <string id="88359" soundid="134251">The fountains were tainted with human blood, which shattered their seals. The blood that stained them is gone. Replacing the seals should restore them.</string>
  <string id="88364" soundid="156920"></string>
  <string id="88365" soundid="134257">Only that you should do as the Water Dragon asked and try to restore the fountains of Dirge.</string>
  <string id="88366" soundid="134258">I know the monastery well. If there are questions you wish to ask in your quest to restore the fountains, I will do my best to answer them.</string>
  <string id="88367" soundid="134259">The amulet is an artifact of great power, though few truly understand its nature. What do you wish to know?</string>
  <string id="88368" soundid="134260">The amulet is a powerful tool, but it is only a tool. When you were first learning to unleash the power within you, the amulet helped you to focus your mind and energy.</string>
  <string id="88369" soundid="134261">But you are a Spirit Monk. The power of the Water Dragon was always in you, not in the amulet. Now you are strong enough to draw on that power without the amulet.</string>
  <string id="88370" soundid="134262">You no longer need the amulet, but Li has a use for it. Li&apos;s brother Sun Hai consumed the Water Dragon&apos;s power, but without the amulet it was a long and slow process.</string>
  <string id="88371" soundid="134263">Even after twenty years, he was not strong enough to defeat you. Had the Lotus Assassins brought him enough pieces of the amulet, he would have been far more powerful.</string>
  <string id="88372" soundid="134264">But Sun Li has the amulet, making him far more dangerous. With it, he can draw on the Water Dragon&apos;s power much faster. Unless you stop him soon, he will become invincible.</string>
  <string id="88373" soundid="134265">I did not want the amulet to fall into the hands of our enemy. When I realized the battle was lost, I shattered it into several pieces.</string>
  <string id="88374" soundid="134266">I gave the pieces to my apprentices and told them to flee to the farthest reaches of the Empire. The core of the amulet was given to the young monk who fled with you.</string>
  <string id="88375" soundid="134267">I knew the core alone would be enough for you to start discovering your true power, but anyone else would need to find all the pieces to use the amulet.</string>
  <string id="88376" soundid="134268">I will do my best to answer whatever questions you might have.</string>
  <string id="88377" soundid="134269">I would be honored to help you learn more about our order and your legacy.</string>
  <string id="88378" soundid="134270">I will try my best to explain the glorious mysteries of the god we serve.</string>
  <string id="88379" soundid="134271">You are probably right. We must restore the Water Dragon&apos;s power before Sun Li gains full command of her powers.</string>
  <string id="88393" soundid="134285">There is no way through the gates. The Emperor sealed them twenty years ago. Now they keep me from entering my own monastery.</string>
  <string id="88394" soundid="134286">If we can restore the fountain, the gates may open for us.</string>
  <string id="88398" soundid="134290">You must restore the fountain before these doors will open.</string>
  <string id="88475" soundid="137773">Remember Jing Woo back in Two Rivers? He talked of fighting in the Imperial Arena one day. He would have done well.</string>
  <string id="88478" soundid="137776">This city has so many wonders. I never dreamed of such a place.</string>
  <string id="88479" soundid="144739">Easy there. You fell flat on your face after the fight. Are you prone to that sort of thing?</string>
  <string id="88480" soundid="138238">[Nothing happens.]</string>
  <string id="88481" soundid="138239">[The statue erupts in a loud burst of energy. Clearly you have done something momentous. You feel different.]</string>
  <string id="88482" soundid="135896">They&apos;re quite common around the Imperial City. The trick is to obtain a wind map that allows you to navigate the air currents over large distances.</string>
  <string id="88483" soundid="135897">Acquiring that chart was a hard fought battle, I can assure you. The Lotus Assassins keep a tight rein on those precious documents.</string>
  <string id="88484" soundid="135898">Indeed, though you would also need a flyer with enough fuel to manage the trip. Those are in precious short supply in this area of the Empire.</string>
  <string id="88485" soundid="135899">Then again, you seem resourceful, and I believe resourceful people find ways to get things done.</string>
  <string id="88486" soundid="135900">Perhaps you could get something done for me. If so, I might be persuaded to foolishly risk the Lotus Assassins&apos; wrath by making a copy of one of their precious maps.</string>
  <string id="88487" soundid="135901">The only flyers I know of in this region are flown by a group of pirates near Tien&apos;s Landing.</string>
  <string id="88488" soundid="135902">I&apos;m not sure where they get the resources to make raids from the air, but I am quite sure that they&apos;d object if you tried to borrow one of their airships.</string>
  <string id="88489" soundid="135903">Someone in Tien&apos;s Landing probably knows more about them. Perhaps that Minister... Sheng, is it? He must at least be aware of their activities.</string>
  <string id="88490" soundid="135904">You clearly don&apos;t understand the value of a wind map. I don&apos;t have it on me in this rough camp.</string>
  <string id="88491" soundid="135905">If you take that map, and I cannot return it to the Assassins, I&apos;m a dead man already. Threaten me if you will; I prefer a quick death to what they would do to me. </string>
  <string id="88492" soundid="135906">I am willing to risk a copy because we share the blame, and you would have as much to lose as I, were the assassins to learn of this arrangement.</string>
  <string id="88493" soundid="135907">The deal is simple. Find out why my land sickens--why it is home to so many ghosts--and you will have your map.</string>
  <string id="88494" soundid="135908">No bartering, no record of this discussion. A simple agreement between a Lord and a highly skilled woman.</string>
  <string id="88495" soundid="135909">No negotiation, no contracts to sign, just an agreement between gentlemen.</string>
  <string id="88496" soundid="135910">Then you are out one very precious map. Unless my luck changes, then I am also out one forest. You may as well hear the tale of this place before you refuse.</string>
  <string id="88497" soundid="135911">Two things threaten the entire length and breadth of this forest: The trees blacken with disease, and ghosts flock to this place like no other in the Empire.</string>
  <string id="88498" soundid="135912">I suspect that these things are related and, more importantly, that they&apos;re related to a fox called the Forest Shadow.</string>
  <string id="88499" soundid="135913">She is a powerful being, one my father considered the guardian of this forest.</string>
  <string id="88500" soundid="135914">If this place is filled with ghosts, then I suspect that it is either because of or in spite of her.</string>
  <string id="88501" soundid="135915">Just that. She is a fox spirit, and thus one of heaven&apos;s tricksters. The fox can take on the forms of men and women and will often do so to test us.</string>
  <string id="88502" soundid="135916">Personally, I don&apos;t think they have any right to deceive us, but my father felt that our family&apos;s good fortune came from just such a test passed long ago by an ancestor.</string>
  <string id="88503" soundid="135917">Some sort of ancient alliance, in which she was guardian of the forest while we owned the land in the world of men.</string>
  <string id="88504" soundid="135918">She is a powerful spirit that has long been an ally of my family. Personally, I&apos;ve had little to do with her.</string>
  <string id="88505" soundid="135919">My father and his father before him, however, felt strongly that she should be revered. They considered her the true guardian of this forest.</string>
  <string id="88506" soundid="135920">No one really knows. It&apos;s out of character for a fox spirit, that I can assure you. They normally test men&apos;s worth and pass judgment.</string>
  <string id="88507" soundid="135921">At first I wondered if this disease and these ghosts are a test for me, but that doesn&apos;t feel right. Not like this.</string>
  <string id="88508" soundid="135922">I think something is wrong with the Forest Shadow, and I want you to find her and figure out what is happening. Once we know that, we&apos;ll have a clear idea of what we face.</string>
  <string id="88509" soundid="135923">A noble sentiment, but when I look upon these trees, I&apos;m afraid that you may have to destroy her. See what you can learn first. Then we will act if it is necessary.</string>
  <string id="88510" soundid="135924">I would prefer not, but if it is necessary, do what you think is right. She has been an ally to my family in the past, but I do not hold with the worship of tricksters.</string>
  <string id="88511" soundid="135925">Make your way up this ancient trail, and when you come to a fork, take the left path. That will lead you to a temple built long ago in the Forest Shadow&apos;s honor.</string>
  <string id="88514" soundid="183011">If we can stop the bandits quickly, we can keep everyone safe. </string>
  <string id="88515" soundid="137780">I... do not like this place. Even compared to the rest of the Necropolis this is a dark and troubled place.</string>
  <string id="88518" soundid="137783">I sense so much pain here; it is almost overwhelming. Whatever they do here is monstrous.</string>
  <string id="88520" soundid="137785">This... this cannot be. How can this be allowed?</string>
  <string id="88521" soundid="137786">It&apos;s... almost over. I don&apos;t think there&apos;s anything left in the Empire for us to battle through.</string>
  <string id="88522" soundid="137787">Everyone was so scared, and I still am. That sorcerer seemed far too interested in you and Master Li.</string>
  <string id="88523" soundid="137788">No... it&apos;s all gone. Why did Gao&apos;s father do this? Why are his men here?</string>
  <string id="88524" soundid="137789">The school... everything is gone. Quickly, there have to be survivors! They can&apos;t all have fallen. They can&apos;t! </string>
  <string id="88528" soundid="137793">A second floor? I&apos;m surprised a town this small can support such a large teahouse.</string>
  <string id="88529" soundid="137794">Be careful in here. I don&apos;t relish the idea of fighting my way out of this place.</string>
  <string id="88530" soundid="137795">This teahouse must be popular. It seems like quite a prominent structure.</string>
  <string id="88531" soundid="137796">These docks remind me of the fishermen in Two Rivers. A shame we will never see them again.</string>
  <string id="88533" soundid="137798">There is something dangerous beyond these gates. The spirits here are... troubled.</string>
  <string id="88535" soundid="137800">There is much suffering in this quarry. So many lives lost.</string>
  <string id="88536" soundid="137801">This must be the guardian the Lotus Assassin spoke of.</string>
  <string id="88538" soundid="137803">Water has covered old Tien&apos;s Landing once again, but there is much it will not wash away.</string>
  <string id="88539" soundid="137804">Be careful in here. This could be a trap.</string>
  <string id="88541" soundid="137806">Look at that flyer... it&apos;s beautiful. The Marvelous Dragonfly is the perfect name.</string>
  <string id="88543" soundid="137808">This forest is so troubled. We were well-sheltered in Two Rivers to not see any of this.</string>
  <string id="88550" soundid="137815">Remind me again why I encouraged you to fight these cannibals? My wife&apos;s right, I am a shortsighted fool.</string>
  <string id="88554" soundid="137819">No other place in the Empire can compare to the Imperial City. I love the peaceful bustle of commerce... and the absence of my wife.</string>
  <string id="88555" soundid="137820">Ah, the smell of success. My sweet lily would prefer that *I* smell of sweat and yeast, instead.</string>
  <string id="88560" soundid="137825">The garden is a beautiful place, but there&apos;s only a title&apos;s difference between a scholar and a fool who won&apos;t shut up.</string>
  <string id="88562" soundid="137827">It&apos;s times like this when the thought of seeing my wife again actually gives me hope.</string>
  <string id="88563" soundid="137828">Somehow I always pictured the golems being pieced together... like a puzzle.</string>
  <string id="88564" soundid="137829">Jia seems like a reasonable woman. Of course, I only have my wife as a comparison.</string>
  <string id="88566" soundid="137831">They say spirits can sense your fear. I fear they knew I was coming before we left the city.</string>
  <string id="88569" soundid="137834">I know I&apos;ve said this before... but this time I really do have a bad feeling about this.</string>
  <string id="88570" soundid="137835">No man alive was meant to see this... or would want to.</string>
  <string id="88571" soundid="137836">What are you waiting for? Kill him quickly, or we&apos;ll all be dead.</string>
  <string id="88575">Who are you?</string>
  <string id="88576">Are you Abbot Song?</string>
  <string id="88577">Stay back, spirit!</string>
  <string id="88579">The Glorious Strategist? You mean Master Li?</string>
  <string id="88581">So you&apos;re the leader of the Spirit Monks?</string>
  <string id="88583">What are you talking about?</string>
  <string id="88584">Where am I? Is this Dirge?</string>
  <string id="88587">No... that&apos;s not true. Master Li rescued me.</string>
  <string id="88588">Li claimed he was the one who saved me.</string>
  <string id="88589">I guess my whole life has been a lie.</string>
  <string id="88590" soundid="144740">In the what? Your Master taught you some interesting things. Come on, we need to move our camp somewhere that no ghosts attack.</string>
  <string id="88591" soundid="144741">You saw a vision? Strange that I could not make it out. Strong spirits are usually quite clear to me. Please tell me if you have any more.</string>
  <string id="88592" soundid="145249">Ah, you found your way. Good. I decided there wasn&apos;t much point in staying with the flyer. It&apos;s not going to get much worse, in my opinion.</string>
  <string id="88594" soundid="144743">Very well. Where you choose to take a nap is your business.</string>
  <string id="88595" soundid="144744">I... I guess we should. I just wish I knew what was going on.</string>
  <string id="88600">What happened when they attacked Dirge?</string>
  <string id="88601">How did he defeat Water Dragon?</string>
  <string id="88604">The Emperor must have been mad to think this was acceptable.</string>
  <string id="88606">Confront the Minion of Suffering</string>
  <string id="88607">Find the Minion of Suffering and confront him.</string>
  <string id="88608">The corruption of Dirge has allowed something malevolent to take up residence in the temple. The Minion of Suffering awaits you in the cave to the east. You must find and destroy the creature to regain the missing seal that will restore the second fountain. Once Dirge is restored the Water Dragon can restore you to life.</string>
  <string id="88610">Destroy the Abomination in the Temple</string>
  <string id="88611">Go to the temple and confront the Abomination that resides there.</string>
  <string id="88612">The way to the temple courtyard is open. Enter the temple and confront the Abomination that has corrupted Dirge. When this malevolent presence is purged, the Water Dragon will have enough power to restore you to life.</string>
  <string id="88613">Dirge is restored, the Spirit Monks have been freed from their bonds, and the Water Dragon has restored your physical form. Sun Li awaits you.</string>
  <string id="88614">Find the Gem</string>
  <string id="88615">Search in the western section of the inner courtyard for the gem.</string>
  <string id="88617">You have found the gem that the abbot mentioned. Once you purge the corruption that has infected Dirge the Water Dragon will restore you to life.</string>
  <string id="88618">Return to game.</string>
  <string id="88619" soundid="163527">We should get back to Two Rivers. Master Li needs to be told about what Gao said.</string>
  <string id="88620" soundid="163528">We have to find Master Li. There have to be survivors.</string>
  <string id="88634" soundid="163545">A manual of regimented conditioning will serve you well. Red meat, constitutionals, and union suit calisthenics. You&apos;re never so fit as when the johns are long.</string>
  <string id="88635">Who was she?</string>
  <string id="88636">This woman was once a Spirit Monk?</string>
  <string id="88637">So she betrayed you?</string>
  <string id="88640">What happened to Xian Wu?</string>
  <string id="88641">And you never suspected anything?</string>
  <string id="88642">Why didn&apos;t you mention this before?</string>
  <string id="88644">You were a fool to trust them.</string>
  <string id="88646">Sounds like they got what they deserved.</string>
  <string id="88647">That&apos;s awful!</string>
  <string id="88648">What&apos;s so bad about the binding?</string>
  <string id="88649">I don&apos;t understand. How did he bind their spirits?</string>
  <string id="88652">So the Emperor did this to Xian Wu?</string>
  <string id="88653">I still don&apos;t see why this is so bad.</string>
  <string id="88656">We can bind living people, too?</string>
  <string id="88657" soundid="192577"></string>
  <string id="88658">Can you teach me how to bind the living?</string>
  <string id="88661">What&apos;s going on here?</string>
  <string id="88662">Are these the spirits of those who died in the attack?</string>
  <string id="88664">Don&apos;t blame yourself.</string>
  <string id="88665">Why aren&apos;t you caught up in this battle?</string>
  <string id="88667">You weren&apos;t much of a leader, were you?</string>
  <string id="88670">So you can&apos;t get back into the temple?</string>
  <string id="88671">Why didn&apos;t you follow Li?</string>
  <string id="88672">So you ran like a coward, and now you can&apos;t get back?</string>
  <string id="88675">Dirge will be restored, Abbot Song. I swear it.</string>
  <string id="88676">All I care about is getting back to the land of the living.</string>
  <string id="88677">They couldn&apos;t harm me anyway.</string>
  <string id="88678">So what destroyed the guardian?</string>
  <string id="88679">Maybe we have an ally in here.</string>
  <string id="88680">Good. One less thing to worry about.</string>
  <string id="88682">You mean a demon?</string>
  <string id="88683">Whatever it is, I&apos;ll destroy it!</string>
  <string id="88684">Are you saying you&apos;re scared?</string>
  <string id="88687">Don&apos;t worry. We&apos;ll find it.</string>
  <string id="88688">So what do we do now?</string>
  <string id="88689">Just tell me where it is so I can kill it!</string>
  <string id="88691" soundid="158171">I don&apos;t know much, but I saw one lift a stone no human could move. It looked immensely armored. The Lotus Assassin fortress seems the center of production.</string>
  <string id="88693">Tell me what you know about golems.</string>
  <string id="88698">How am I supposed to restore the fountains?</string>
  <string id="88699" soundid="156921"></string>
  <string id="88700" soundid="156922"></string>
  <string id="88701">Do you have any advice for me?</string>
  <string id="88702">I want to ask you some questions.</string>
  <string id="88703">I want to know more about my amulet.</string>
  <string id="88704">I saw Li take it from me. How can I still use it?</string>
  <string id="88706">If the power was mine, what does the amulet do?</string>
  <string id="88707">If the amulet is only a focus, why did Li take it from me?</string>
  <string id="88710">Why is it so powerful?</string>
  <string id="88711">Why were pieces of the amulet scattered across the Empire?</string>
  <string id="88714">I want to ask you something else.</string>
  <string id="88715">I&apos;m curious about the Spirit Monks and Dirge.</string>
  <string id="88716">You said I was born here at Dirge?</string>
  <string id="88717">What did the Spirit Monks do, exactly?</string>
  <string id="88718">Tell me more about Dirge.</string>
  <string id="88719">Tell me more about the Water Dragon.</string>
  <string id="88720">What was the Water Dragon the god of, exactly?</string>
  <string id="88721">How did the Emperor take her power?</string>
  <string id="88722">Can she really bring me back to life?</string>
  <string id="88723">I think we should move on.</string>
  <string id="88729" soundid="189584"></string>
  <string id="88731" soundid="189586"></string>
  <string id="88732" soundid="135933">Once there, find my hunter Spear Catches Leaf, if he still lives. He claimed to remember some sort of ritual that my forebears used to contact the Forest Shadow.</string>
  <string id="88733" soundid="135934">Remember that you want to go to the temple by the left fork when you reach the branch up above.</string>
  <string id="88734" soundid="135935">If you go to the right, you can find the Pilgrim&apos;s Rest Inn, an establishment I technically own but have very little to do with.</string>
  <string id="88735" soundid="135936">One of my hunters usually collects the taxes from them on my behalf.</string>
  <string id="88736" soundid="135937">It is impossible to miss. The temple is an impressive structure, carved into the rock itself.</string>
  <string id="88737" soundid="135938">You may, but I would find it unlikely. To call this area the safest part of the forest is misleading. The ghosts are numerous and vicious.</string>
  <string id="88738" soundid="135939">How would simple travelers and innkeepers survive when surrounded and cut off by these ghosts?</string>
  <string id="88739" soundid="135940">What else would aid you?</string>
  <string id="88740" soundid="135941">Ask him yourself, he&apos;s right there.</string>
  <string id="88741" soundid="135942">Perhaps the question is about your take on me, Lord?</string>
  <string id="88742" soundid="135943">Spear Catches Leaf is one of the best men I know. He&apos;s skilled and wise, and I can trust him, which is more than I will say for most. Beyond that, ask him yourself.</string>
  <string id="88743" soundid="135944">Spear Catches Leaf is one of my best men, and I&apos;m worried that I sent him to his doom. He insisted that he try this ritual, though.</string>
  <string id="88744" soundid="135945">To keep him safe, I sent another mercenary up with him. A hulking fellow who seemed more than adept with his axes.</string>
  <string id="88745" soundid="135946">This mercenary lacked your grace, poise, manners, and likely much of your skill, but then he had the good graces to work for the traditional pay: silver.</string>
  <string id="88746" soundid="135947">If the Forest Shadow is responsible, then you must find some way to stop her. Given her centuries-old connection to this forest, I expect we&apos;ll know in some way.</string>
  <string id="88747" soundid="135948">If she is not the cause, then we can only pray that she knows more about things than us. Hopefully you will be able to learn the truth from her.</string>
  <string id="88748" soundid="135949">Then you may still be able to learn something if Spear Catches Leaf was successful in reaching her first. If not, then we are both out of luck.</string>
  <string id="88749" soundid="135950">The same way I can be sure you&apos;ll hold up your end of things. I have something you need, and vice versa.</string>
  <string id="88750" soundid="135951">If you prove capable of curing this forest, I&apos;d be a fool to deny you your just reward out of spite, wouldn&apos;t I?</string>
  <string id="88751" soundid="135952">I don&apos;t fancy dying any time soon, and without your reward, you&apos;d not only be capable, but justified in murdering me where I stand.</string>
  <string id="88752" soundid="135953">That&apos;s true. I&apos;ll tell you whatever I can.</string>
  <string id="88756">Trainer: Smiling Mountain</string>
  <string id="88757">It is all a matter of training.</string>
  <string id="88759">Not many people have my skills.</string>
  <string id="88761">Are these ghosts a major problem?</string>
  <string id="88764">I&apos;m curious about this place. Will you answer a few questions?</string>
  <string id="88765">What is this area?</string>
  <string id="88768">How long have you been having problems with ghosts?</string>
  <string id="88771">Why are you camped here?</string>
  <string id="88774">What did you think you might learn by camping here?</string>
  <string id="88775">Why wouldn&apos;t you want to return to the city?</string>
  <string id="88777">Let&apos;s go back to my other questions.</string>
  <string id="88778">Is there any route from here to the Imperial City?</string>
  <string id="88781">Did you just say you have a flyer near here?</string>
  <string id="88783">That&apos;s enough of these questions for now.</string>
  <string id="88784">There&apos;s something else I wanted to ask.</string>
  <string id="88785">Perhaps there&apos;s some way I can help you.</string>
  <string id="88787">I&apos;ll take your advice and go back to Tien&apos;s Landing.</string>
  <string id="88789">I&apos;m trailing a group of Lotus Assassins who took my master.</string>
  <string id="88791">I am seeking a route to the Imperial City.</string>
  <string id="88795" soundid="138240">Examine your world from all angles and you will see the interconnectedness of all things. Even that which is humble can be the key to greater things.</string>
  <string id="88796" soundid="138241">[The sphere grows dim.]</string>
  <string id="88797">Where did you acquire a flyer?</string>
  <string id="88799">It seems I need your wind map to travel north.</string>
  <string id="88802">Do you have any idea where I could find a flyer?</string>
  <string id="88805">What are you proposing in return for the wind map?</string>
  <string id="88806">What if I just killed you and took your wind map?</string>
  <string id="88807">What if I make you tell me where it is?</string>
  <string id="88809">What do you propose?</string>
  <string id="88811">You have a deal. I&apos;ll find out what&apos;s wrong with your land.</string>
  <string id="88812">What if I say no?</string>
  <string id="88815">Why do you think the ghosts are related to this spirit?</string>
  <string id="88817">What do you mean by &quot;a fox?&quot;</string>
  <string id="88820">Who is the Forest Shadow?</string>
  <string id="88822">I&apos;ve heard enough about this fox spirit. What do I need to do?</string>
  <string id="88825">I will do what I can to save her.</string>
  <string id="88827">She could be behind this. I&apos;ll just eliminate her.</string>
  <string id="88831" soundid="136073">If there are still people there, then whoever took the crystal might be there, as well. But... just be careful.</string>
  <string id="88833" soundid="189615"></string>
  <string id="88834" soundid="136076">I don&apos;t think so. He&apos;d have to be quite strong to pull the crystal loose. It doesn&apos;t make any sense to me, but then, what in this place does?</string>
  <string id="88836">Exit to Outer Courtyard</string>
  <string id="88838">What else is along this path?</string>
  <string id="88841">How will I recognize the temple?</string>
  <string id="88842">Might I find any help at the inn?</string>
  <string id="88844">That&apos;s all I need to know about the path specifically.</string>
  <string id="88845">Tell me more about Spear Catches Leaf.</string>
  <string id="88850">How will you know I&apos;ve succeeded?</string>
  <string id="88852">What happens if I can&apos;t reach this fox spirit?</string>
  <string id="88853">How can I be sure I can trust your end of the bargain?</string>
  <string id="88856">The more I know, the better chance I have of succeeding.</string>

  <string id="88867">I should go to the inn and find out what I can.</string>
  <string id="88868" soundid="137845">Mmm. Can you smell that? Civilized tea and buns. It has been a long time since I have enjoyed such simple pleasures.</string>
  <string id="88870" soundid="137847">This is quite a remarkable market for such a small village. Perhaps my wife would like to retire here. With me, of course. Never a thought otherwise.</string>
  <string id="88872" soundid="137849">Step lightly around these fireworks, or whatever they are. After years of married bliss, I am uncomfortable around anything with a short fuse.</string>

  <string id="88895" soundid="137872">*This* is the Ministry hostel? Where do they spend all the silver they demand of the Empire, then?</string>
  <string id="88897" soundid="137874">From what I know of them, the guild doesn&apos;t usually conduct business this openly, or in such elegance.</string>
  <string id="88900" soundid="137877">We need to get out of here! We&apos;ll be crushed!</string>
  <string id="88901" soundid="137878">That machine is massive. Who knew the assassins were constructing it in my father&apos;s tomb?</string>

  <string id="88903" soundid="137880">This is an ancient repository of knowledge. It contains records of the Empire.</string>
  <string id="88905" soundid="137882">This site was to be my father&apos;s tomb. I doubt he knows what use Death&apos;s Hand has put it to.</string>

  <string id="88908" soundid="137885">What is this horror? I pray my eyes deceive me.</string>

  <string id="88919" soundid="137896">Filth, poverty, and crime: The docks in every city throughout the Empire are the same.</string>
  <string id="88920" soundid="137897">I&apos;m surprised this town has such a large market square. It&apos;s a wonder so many merchants can make a living.</string>

  <string id="89044" soundid="138021">Lots of children are born every day. I was born at that time. If you don&apos;t count this latest rebirth, so was our friend here.</string>
  <string id="89045" soundid="138022">But I was named for the fires of Dirge. Hui said as much, and it seems obvious now. The red glow opposite the morning sun was the temple burning.</string>
  <string id="89046" soundid="138023">So what if it was? It could have been visible across the Empire.</string>
  <string id="89047" soundid="138024">But that&apos;s not... that would make her....</string>
  <string id="89048" soundid="138025">A cousin? A princess? A rival?</string>
  <string id="89049" soundid="138026">You be quiet. This is not amusing.</string>
  <string id="89050" soundid="138027">You still seek to redeem your master, even after what he did to you? Clearly you are beyond reason. Fine, believe what you wish.</string>
  <string id="89051" soundid="138028">Does anyone care how I feel about this?</string>
  <string id="89052" soundid="138029">I... I am unsure what this really means, but we must tell Master Li and try to appeal to his sense of decency. This could lift so much pain from his heart.</string>
  <string id="89053" soundid="138030">You are both crazy. I&apos;ll go along with it if it helps us in the end, but I&apos;ll need more proof to believe it, and I expect Sun Li will, too.</string>
  <string id="89054" soundid="138031">We have to survive the coming attack before anyone is told anything. We&apos;ve done all we can for now. Tomorrow will decide our fates.</string>
  <string id="89055" soundid="138032">We must use it to unsettle him. That will make it easier to defeat him. He used all of us... we can&apos;t let this opportunity go.</string>
  <string id="89056" soundid="138033">I don&apos;t want to be used like this. Did you enjoy being Master Li&apos;s tool? He should be told, but try to see this as a way to get through to him.</string>
  <string id="89057" soundid="138034">A ploy with potential, but you might as well make up anything. This is hard to swallow.</string>
  <string id="89058" soundid="138035">Fortifications... hmmm... perhaps I will remove some of the ordnance from the Marvelous Dragonfly. Properly applied, it may prove useful tomorrow.</string>
  <string id="89059" soundid="138036">Come Whirlwind! I need your muscle!</string>
  <string id="89060" soundid="138037">That&apos;s the *Black* Whirlwind, and as long as it makes the coming fight more interesting, I&apos;ll lift whatever you want.</string>
  <string id="89061" soundid="138038">That is all we can do for now. Tomorrow will decide our fates.</string>
  <string id="89062" soundid="138039">We should all get some rest. But... if I could have a word with you when the others have gone... I need to speak with you.</string>
  <string id="89063" soundid="138040"></string>
  <string id="89066">There was something. It was about you and Master Li.</string>
  <string id="89073">The burning temple was only visible from the palace.</string>
  <string id="89076">Perhaps this will restore Master Li&apos;s good side.</string>
  <string id="89078">Of course, Dawn Star. What should we do about this?</string>
  <string id="89083">Not especially. We will use it to my benefit, regardless.</string>
  <string id="89088">No, it is a very useful tool. Master Li will be weakened when I tell him.</string>
  <string id="89090">No. The Water Dragon says otherwise. Only from the palace.</string>
  <string id="89091">Yes, a bit of information about you that is sure to rattle Master Li.</string>
  <string id="89099">I can&apos;t hurt you?!</string>
  <string id="89100">For the Emperor!</string>
  <string id="89101">Down, peasant!</string>
  <string id="89102">Do not resist me!</string>
  <string id="89103">Guards! To me!</string>
  <string id="89104">You can&apos;t escape!</string>

  <string id="89112">Why didn&apos;t you tell me before? I could have prepared!</string>
  <string id="89114">I am glad you trust me, but they still plan to launch a sneak attack?</string>
  <string id="89116" soundid="138173">Well, that&apos;s convenient for my nerves.</string>
  <string id="89117" soundid="138174">My wounds will make me a burden if I stay at your side. I will keep guard over the temple itself. Groups landing there should be small enough for me to handle.</string>
  <string id="89118" soundid="138175">I&apos;ll signal with the temple bell if it&apos;s too much for me to handle. I&apos;m sure we will be ready for whatever comes.</string>
  <string id="89119">Collapsed Tunnel</string>
  <string id="89123">Then I personally defeat Death&apos;s Hand, and the army will fall. I like it.</string>

  <string id="89627" soundid="145259">And I have declined to answer those questions. My past is my own business. If that changes, I will let you know.</string>
  <string id="89628" soundid="145260">Nothing to concern yourself over. Very old business. I traveled this way when I was fleeing the Lotus Assassins.</string>
  <string id="89629" soundid="145261">It was nothing. Some vagrant waif I passed off after making sure its belly was full. A far less surprising turn than what Hui said about your Master Li.</string>
  <string id="89630" soundid="145262">I know Hui to be a truthful and honorable person. Much more so than I consider myself to be. I do not question her belief, but belief alone is not enough.</string>
  <string id="89631" soundid="145263">What if it *is* true? Much will have to change to accommodate this &quot;truth.&quot; It means the Emperor lied about Li&apos;s death, and he may have assaulted the heavens.</string>
  <string id="89632" soundid="145264">The *Emperor* subject to the common vice of deception? Unthinkable.</string>
  <string id="89633" soundid="145265">Perhaps, but that, too, implies a weakness that the Emperor cannot have.</string>
  <string id="89634" soundid="145266">I warn you, this will lead in a dangerous direction for you and Dawn Star. I cannot condone it... but I have agreed to help, and I will.</string>
  <string id="89635" soundid="145267">Just don&apos;t blame me when the whole world is against you.</string>
  <string id="89636" soundid="145268">You and your companions have shown me a path I previously thought closed. Give me no more thought than that. Now, is there anything else?</string>
  <string id="89637" soundid="145269">No, he is not. He is Emperor Sun Hai. He is as close to the heavens as a mortal can be.</string>
  <string id="89638" soundid="145270">Perhaps my path has joined the low road once or twice, but you don&apos;t have to be an earnest schoolboy to know that anarchy is madness. The order of things is important.</string>
  <string id="89639" soundid="145271">Oh, choosing to leave is easy enough. Surviving the choice is not. Is that a surprise, given their nature? Hui&apos;s comments about Master Li are more outlandish.</string>
  <string id="89640" soundid="145272">I won&apos;t get in your way if you don&apos;t get in mine. I have nothing more to say about where we are.</string>
  <string id="89641">Your connection to your guardian demon severed, your soul is lost for all eternity.</string>
  <string id="89643" soundid="145275">Our enemy? The sure sign of an effective fighter is that he has many enemies. Which are you most curious about?</string>
  <string id="89644" soundid="145276">A small man. He bears a grudge against the world because his wealth cannot buy him the status he wants. At least, that is my estimation of him.</string>
  <string id="89645" soundid="145277">If we encounter him in his holdings near Tien&apos;s Landing, I doubt he will be very welcoming. Not after he learns the fate of his son.</string>
  <string id="89646">I have questions about you and the Lotus Assassins.</string>
  <string id="89647">Why did you leave them?</string>
  <string id="89648">I want to talk about you.</string>
  <string id="89649">What do you think about our current situation?</string>
  <string id="89650">I have questions about our enemy.</string>
  <string id="89651">Tell me about Gao the Greater.</string>
  <string id="89653">I want to go back to my other questions.</string>
  <string id="89654">I want to know about the Emperor.</string>
  <string id="89656">It seems to me that either he approves or he has lost power.</string>
  <string id="89658">Why not?</string>
  <string id="89659">Tell me about Death&apos;s Hand and the Lotus Assassins.</string>
  <string id="89662">Goodbye for now.</string>
  <string id="89668">I am supposed to accept that answer?</string>
  <string id="89670">Very well, but I will be watching you.</string>
  <string id="89671">Then I will not press the matter. For now.</string>
  <string id="89672">How can I be certain of that?</string>
  <string id="89674">I want to know what you and Hui were talking about.</string>
  <string id="89675">I want to know more about this &quot;child&quot; she mentioned.</string>
  <string id="89676">She confirmed that he is the Emperor&apos;s brother.</string>
  <string id="89677">Are you dismissing what she said?</string>
  <string id="89679">Cannibal</string>
  <string id="89682">Cannibal</string>
  <string id="89686">Then Death&apos;s Hand has far more influence than he should.</string>
  <string id="89689">I appreciate your help, even if you give it reluctantly.</string>
  <string id="89690">Why stay if you are so reluctant?</string>
  <string id="89691">Why is it unthinkable? He is a man, like any other.</string>
  <string id="89693">You don&apos;t seem the type to hold such allegiance to the Empire.</string>
  <string id="89695">You were fleeing? So leaving the Lotus Assassins was not a choice?</string>
  <string id="89696">I want to talk about you some more. You seem agitated.</string>
  <string id="89697">I want to talk about what Inquisitor Lim said about you.</string>
  <string id="89706" soundid="139127">Look, we have fresh blood. Another soul for the forge, or a new pet for the masters? We don&apos;t need more competition for attention.</string>
  <string id="89707" soundid="139128">With the rise of the golems, we acolytes have fewer opportunities to serve. You are unwelcome.</string>
  <string id="89708" soundid="139129">We all serve, but those who serve are not all equal. </string>
  <string id="89709" soundid="139130">You spout big words, but you are in no position to back them up.</string>
  <string id="89710" soundid="139131">We are losing status to the golem army and you want to take more attention away from us? I think you need to prove your worth.</string>
  <string id="89711" soundid="139132">Should he prove his worth? No, he can defend it, or die.</string>
  <string id="89712" soundid="139133">Accepted, yes, but not tested. If you die here, clearly you are not capable of joining us. We have no need of acolytes that cannot even reach their master.</string>
  <string id="89713" soundid="139134">You, kill this fool.</string>
  <string id="89714" soundid="139135">More blood to stain my hands. A badge of honor.</string>
  <string id="89715" soundid="139136">Ah, you realize the inevitability of this challenge. Good, that will make it easier to justify.</string>
  <string id="89716" soundid="139137">Bah! You are skilled, but Assassins are not just quick steps and cuts. We will see if you are strong enough. This isn&apos;t over.</string>
  <string id="89717">Your end is near!</string>
  <string id="89720">I only seek to serve the Lotus Assassins. Let me pass.</string>
  <string id="89722">Out of my way, or you&apos;ll be dead when I&apos;m running the place.</string>
  <string id="89725">Your masters will not like this. I am an accepted recruit.</string>
  <string id="89728">If any of you think you can beat me, step up now, or stand aside.</string>
  <string id="89730">My style is flawless!</string>
  <string id="89732">I will sacrifice what I can for her life.</string>
  <string id="89739">I have done all I can.</string>
  <string id="89745">You ask too much of me.</string>
  <string id="89751">If I help you, you&apos;ll only tell the others what I&apos;ve done. I have to let you go.</string>
  <string id="89752">For that price, I&apos;m your man. Stand down, Aishi!</string>
  <string id="89754">For that price, I&apos;m your woman, Captain Sen. Stand down, Aishi!</string>
  <string id="89760">Help him, Doctor An.</string>
  <string id="89912">Will she be all right?</string>
  <string id="89918">I will take my reward from his possessions.</string>
  <string id="89920">He&apos;ll make it worth your while.</string>
  <string id="89922">You can&apos;t make her help you.</string>
  <string id="89927">My investigation made it clear that he had already slipped away.</string>
  <string id="89930">What could he possibly offer me? He&apos;s gone and there&apos;s no point catching him.</string>
  <string id="89937" soundid="145551">They tried to take from me, and they died. I feasted on their souls. Such is the evil I was in life, and am again in death! The underworld has no place for me! Ji Xin lives!</string>
  <string id="89938" soundid="145552">It doesn&apos;t? But I *want* it to! Blood. Horror. Pain. Despair. The sounds of flesh ripping. This is the music I dream of in my cursed undeath.</string>
  <string id="89939" soundid="145553">I am evil incarnate. A man so vicious and vile that the spirits deemed me unfit to pass into death and cursed me into this wretched form. Ji Xin lives, indeed....</string>
  <string id="89940" soundid="145554">Now, I feed on the flesh and souls of the living in payment for my vanity. My perfect body is a testament to my crimes. My very touch spreads my corruption.</string>
  <string id="89941" soundid="145555">[Success] A chance... to repent. Can it be that after all this time, after years of living death, I am given this one chance to make something right?</string>
  <string id="89942" soundid="145556">What is this &quot;chance&quot; you speak of, mortal? What is this false hope you dangle before me?</string>
  <string id="89943" soundid="145557">Ah, you are a scholar as well. If one believes in one&apos;s own damnation, then that one is truly damned. But then, at least, they will never be proven wrong. The vanity of intellect.</string>
  <string id="89944" soundid="145558">Hah... haha... Hahaha! So true! So true, mortal. For me, there is no hope. For me, there is nothing! And so, for you too, there will be nothing.</string>
  <string id="89945" soundid="145559">[Failure] Never! My sins can never be redeemed! This is my fate! The curse of years weighs down on my soul, and I can never rise from it!</string>
  <string id="89946" soundid="145560">It is, and will forever be. Now you, too, will share in this cursed fate!</string>
  <string id="89947" soundid="145561">Something of mine? You think I&apos;ll part so willingly with something, even if it is just a piece of my own corrupt body?</string>
  <string id="89948" soundid="145562">A girl... after so long, a girl. Hah! But I&apos;m a vile and corrupt being, forever damned by the life I led. Set here in this wretched form to walk forever.</string>
  <string id="89949" soundid="145563">Redemption... for one such as me? I think not. My life was spent in greed and vanity and corruption. Even in death I sought to preserve my perfect form.</string>
  <string id="89950" soundid="145564">For one whose madness and evil progress even into death? No, there is no hope for me. None at all. And you stand here, mocking me for it.</string>
  <string id="89951" soundid="145565">Ah, the temptation! Yes... so much logic... so much philosophy, but who knows what the heavens will truly decide in the end?</string>
  <string id="89952" soundid="145566">But... for the chance... And it is a girl... so young... I can taste her pain and suffering lingering about you. So like my own.</string>
  <string id="89956" soundid="145567">The blood is thick in my veins. A solid mass where fluid used to flow. Now dried and brittle. But the heart still stirs, and it can be moved, though tears no longer flow.</string>
  <string id="89957" soundid="145568">My life has been wasted on my own sins... and in death I have nothing except them. This young thing... this girl... she still deserves life.</string>
  <string id="89958" soundid="145569">If my end means this girl lives, then may the heavens look kindly upon me, even though I know they won&apos;t. If damnation is my fate, then let it be worth something in the end.</string>
  <string id="89959" soundid="145570">Take what you need, mortal.</string>
  <string id="89960">There&apos;s nothing I could tell you, regardless of your offer.</string>
  <string id="89961" soundid="145572">Haha, you have a wit, mortal. I think I&apos;ll enjoy cutting it from your soul, piece by piece.</string>
  <string id="89966" soundid="160019">There&apos;s got to be no better feeling than joining the legends of the Empire itself. Except maybe a good bowl of wine.</string>
  <string id="89973" soundid="154629">[By removing the Jade Heart, you have permanently destroyed the dam&apos;s control mechanism.]</string>
  <string id="89974" soundid="139469">When they asked me to work for the school exclusively, I accepted. I&apos;d rather have a steady life, making weapons by the bunch, than doing special orders all the time.</string>
  <string id="89975" soundid="139470">And every once in a while, I get to make something unique. The masters have some amazing scrolls describing weapons I never even knew existed. </string>
  <string id="89976" soundid="139471">Hmm. Well, it&apos;s the best of its kind in all the Empire, or at least that&apos;s what I&apos;m told. &apos;Course, it&apos;s seen better days.</string>
  <string id="89977" soundid="139472">But, now that you&apos;ve dealt with Smiling Hawk, maybe they can get back to way they once were. I&apos;m sure Kai will make an excellent master.</string>
  <string id="89978" soundid="139473">Having two masters has really hurt the school, if you ask me. Seems the students spend more time bickering than fighting. But what do I know?</string>
  <string id="89979" soundid="139474">If it was me, I&apos;d just kick one of the masters out on his ear. I&apos;d like to tell you which one, too, but I&apos;d better not. Best not to get involved.</string>
  <string id="89980" soundid="139475">Suit yourself. I have a lot of work to do. Good day.</string>
  <string id="89981">The will of the heavens was fulfilled. The heart of the Water Dragon was restored, and her soul, reborn. Balance returned to the heavens, and the Jade Empire endured. His duty discharged, Chai Ka the Heavenly Gate Guardian returned to his heaven once more. 

In honor of her service to the heavens, the girl, Wild Flower, whom Chai Ka had raised to serve as his anchor, was granted the most precious gift of all: Life. She was given a chance to live a new life according to her own whim.</string>
  <string id="89982">In the shattered mind of Wild Flower dwelled the demon Ya Zhen. The power of the one who freed him grew, giving the demon endless possibilities. For a time, he lived by the pledge he made, serving a power greater than himself, but mortals remain mortal, and in time, they die.

  <string id="89991">Tell me about the Black Leopard School.</string>
  <string id="89994">I should be going.</string>
  <string id="89995" soundid="139555">Master Radiant does not want to waste his time on someone who is unprepared. If you can defeat each of us, then you are ready to learn from a master.</string>
  <string id="89996" soundid="139556">An impressive feat, but it was only one fight. As skilled as you are, you must understand that a great fighter must be consistent to remain great.</string>
  <string id="89997" soundid="139557">You have proven you can defeat our novices. Now you must prove yourself against the brothers. The brothers have trained long and are second only in skill to the masters.</string>
  <string id="89998" soundid="139558">Sixth brother is the least skilled, so you will start with him. Work your way to Third Brother. If you succeed against him, you will then challenge me.</string>
  <string id="89999" soundid="139559">You&apos;ll find plenty of challenges here, I assure you.</string>
  <string id="90000" soundid="139560">Second Brother is... not here. For now, you must face only Third Brother and myself... after you&apos;ve defeated the other brothers.</string>
  <string id="90001" soundid="139561">Our students are the best in the Empire. They just might surprise you.</string>
  <string id="90002" soundid="139562">I must be honest with you... I believe Master Radiant has a plan in allowing you to join us. As you may have heard, there are two masters at this school.</string>
  <string id="90003" soundid="139563">Master Radiant and I have tried for some time to temper Master Smiling Hawk&apos;s... ways. He is cunning and ruthless and has little regard for students.</string>
  <string id="90008">I&apos;ll be careful.</string>
  <string id="90010">Why does Master Radiant tolerate him?</string>
  <string id="90012">We&apos;re all fighters. We are all dangerous.</string>
  <string id="90015">No thanks. I have better things to do.</string>
  <string id="90016">Yes. I would like to join the school after all.</string>
  <string id="90017">Remind me why I would want to join.</string>
  <string id="90018">No. I&apos;m still not interested in joining.</string>
  <string id="90019">Yes, I wanted to ask you about the school.</string>
  <string id="90020">What can you tell me about Third Brother?</string>
  <string id="90023">Why are there two masters at the school?</string>
  <string id="90026">Which master do you follow?</string>
  <string id="90029">Where is Second Brother?</string>
  <string id="90032">Why is it called the Black Leopard School?</string>
  <string id="90035">What can you tell me about events outside of the school?</string>
  <string id="90037">I should get back to fighting.</string>
  <string id="90038">How do I set up a fight with the brothers?</string>
  <string id="90039">No. I should get back to fighting.</string>

  <string id="90053">I&apos;m glad I could help. Is there anything more I can do?</string>

  <string id="90066">Greetings. I apologize if I&apos;ve caused any problems.</string>
  <string id="90067">Your students could use a bit of restraint.</string>
  <string id="90068">Your novices are fortunate you came when you did!</string>
  <string id="90070">Yes. I would like that.</string>
  <string id="90071">Why would I want to join your school?</string>
  <string id="90074">Yes. I think I&apos;d like to join the school.</string>
  <string id="90077">That sounds reasonable.</string>
  <string id="90078">Why do I have to prove myself?</string>
  <string id="90080">But I just defeated four of your students... at once!</string>
  <string id="90083">Good. I like a challenge.</string>
  <string id="90084">What about Second Brother?</string>
  <string id="90086">I look forward to defeating all of you!</string>
  <string id="90087" soundid="139647">So you&apos;ve defeated Fourth Brother Yu... finally. You&apos;ll get your chance to see what a real fighter can do soon enough!</string>
  <string id="90088" soundid="139648">Don&apos;t patronize me. I&apos;m not falling for your false flattery.</string>
  <string id="90089" soundid="139649">I would like that, more than you can guess. But I have other orders.</string>
  <string id="90090" soundid="139650">You came to this school. That&apos;s enough.</string>
  <string id="90091" soundid="139651">Master Smiling Hawk wants to see you. He sent me to escort you. Follow me.</string>
  <string id="90092" soundid="139652">Then you are a fool. But I suppose I already knew that. </string>
  <string id="90093" soundid="139653">You are a student, and I am Third Brother. You will do as I say.</string>
  <string id="90094" soundid="139654">Master Smiling Hawk has even less patience than I do. Let&apos;s go!</string>
  <string id="90095" soundid="139655">What do you want? I&apos;ve told First Brother that I withdraw, now go and challenge him.</string>
  <string id="90096" soundid="139656">You are a fool to choose Radiant over the Smiling Hawk. Are you also fool enough to challenge me to a fight?</string>
  <string id="90097">I&apos;m sure you are very skilled, Third Brother.</string>
  <string id="90098">How about right now!</string>
  <string id="90099">What&apos;s the matter? Did I do something to you?</string>
  <string id="90101">I&apos;m not interested in meeting with him.</string>
  <string id="90103">What if I don&apos;t want to meet him?</string>
  <string id="90105">Good. I&apos;ve been looking forward to meeting him.</string>
  <string id="90106" soundid="139666">It was foolish of us to challenge you earlier. I apologize for my impudence.</string>
  <string id="90107" soundid="139667">I can see why the masters chose you to join the school. Even Fourth Brother cannot withstand your skills.</string>
  <string id="90108" soundid="139668">It is a shame that blood was shed, but the school is better off without Smiling Hawk.</string>
  <string id="90109" soundid="139669">I apologize, but I cannot talk right now. I must prepare for a sparring match with Brother Shangjin.</string>
  <string id="90110" soundid="139670">Well, I can&apos;t say I like you anymore now, but I&apos;m grateful that you rid us of that senile old man, Radiant.</string>
  <string id="90111" soundid="139671">We may be novices, but we&apos;re still skilled. You&apos;re lucky Third Brother stopped that fight when he did.</string>
  <string id="90112" soundid="139672">I can&apos;t believe Third Brother lost to *you*. I hope Master Smiling Hawk teaches you a lesson or two.</string>
  <string id="90113" soundid="139673">I don&apos;t really feel like talking right now.</string>
  <string id="90114" soundid="139674">Sorry, I&apos;m new here. There&apos;s really nothing I can do to help you, I&apos;m afraid.</string>
  <string id="90115" soundid="139675">I&apos;m glad Master Smiling Hawk is gone, that man terrified me.</string>
  <string id="90116" soundid="139676">You certainly taught us a thing or two about fighting. I&apos;m just glad you didn&apos;t hurt us too badly.</string>
  <string id="90117" soundid="139677">I can&apos;t believe you defeated Fourth Brother. If I had known you were so skilled I would have never attacked you.</string>
  <string id="90118" soundid="139678">You may have defeated us, but Third Brother will teach you what real fighting is like.</string>
  <string id="90119" soundid="139679">I&apos;m impressed, Third Brother is a difficult opponent. I&apos;ve never seen anyone even come close to defeating him before.</string>
  <string id="90120" soundid="139680">I don&apos;t have time to talk right now.</string>
  <string id="90121" soundid="139681">With Radiant out of the way, Master Smiling Hawk can finally lead this school as it was meant to be led.</string>
  <string id="90122" soundid="139682">Come in, come in quickly, and shut that door behind you. It gets so cold and drafty in here, I can almost feel the wind blowing right through me.</string>
  <string id="90123" soundid="139683">Ha! That was a joke, my young student. You are free to laugh if you feel so inclined. [sigh] Everyone is so serious around here these days.</string>
  <string id="90124" soundid="139684">But Smiling Hawk failed to realize the true nature of his technique. It does not merely borrow your style and power; it takes your life.</string>
  <string id="90125" soundid="139685">And so, with one stealthy encounter, Smiling Hawk not only gained my fighting powers but also eliminated the one person who could challenge him.</string>
  <string id="90126" soundid="139686">There&apos;s nothing more humiliating for a master than waking up and realizing you&apos;ve been beaten by a bookworm... and in your own room, no less!</string>
  <string id="90127" soundid="139687">Yes, but deadly just the same. There is a fine line between ambition and greed, need and lust. Smiling Hawk crossed the line and hasn&apos;t looked back since.</string>
  <string id="90128" soundid="139688">Some might call it that, though I would not be one of them. Boldness is derived from courage, not fear. Smiling Hawk&apos;s lust for power drove him, not his courage.</string>
  <string id="90129" soundid="139689">No doubt you can. You are very astute for someone so young.</string>
  <string id="90130" soundid="139690">Smiling Hawk chose the easy route to power, but it has cost him. The power has changed him and corroded his spirit, but it also makes him very powerful.</string>
  <string id="90131" soundid="139691">First Brother and I have kept him in check, barely. But the balance slowly turns in his favor as he gains more and more power.</string>
  <string id="90132" soundid="139692">That is precisely why I brought you here. You alone have the skill and strength to defeat Smiling Hawk. There is something... different about you.</string>
  <string id="90133" soundid="139693">As a spirit, I can see your power... and its source. It is different for you than for anyone I have ever met.</string>
  <string id="90134" soundid="139694">I won&apos;t tell you that Smiling Hawk cannot harm you, but I&apos;m certain that he cannot steal your power. Not the way he stole mine, at any rate.</string>
  <string id="90135" soundid="139695">Ha! Humility is not one of your strengths. Fortunately, you will not need humility against the Smiling Hawk.</string>
  <string id="90136" soundid="139696">Good luck, young one. Be careful, but be courageous. I know you have what it takes to defeat Smiling Hawk.</string>
  <string id="90137">Just pretend that you told me nothing. I don&apos;t want to risk your son.</string>
  <string id="90139" soundid="139699">Well done. Well done, indeed. There&apos;s something about your fighting... I&apos;m not sure what it is exactly, but it is most unique. Whatever it is, it serves you well.</string>
  <string id="90140" soundid="139700">With Smiling Hawk gone, I can finally heed the call on my spirit. Much longer and I would have been torn from this place forcibly.</string>
  <string id="90141" soundid="139701">Master, why must you leave? I still have so much to learn from you, and we need a strong master to rebuild the school.</string>
  <string id="90142" soundid="139702">Brother Kai, there are some things you must learn for yourself. As long as I stay here, I am holding you back.</string>
  <string id="90143" soundid="139703">And besides... you are ready. You know enough. And what you do not know, you&apos;ll figure out. That is what it means to be a master.</string>
  <string id="90144" soundid="139704">Thank you, if it wasn&apos;t for you... well, this never would have happened. It seems to me that you&apos;re the one who should receive this honor.</string>
  <string id="90145" soundid="139705">Ha! Don&apos;t let Kai&apos;s compliments go to your head. You did us a great favor, and you&apos;re welcome here anytime, but you&apos;re no master.</string>
  <string id="90146" soundid="139706">Yes, that sums it up. You did us a great favor, and you&apos;re welcome here anytime. But you&apos;re no master.</string>
  <string id="90147" soundid="139707">You *are* very likely the most skilled fighter I&apos;ve ever known, but your path lies in a different direction... many directions, if I don&apos;t miss my guess.</string>
  <string id="90148" soundid="139708">This school needs stability, and right now, Kai offers that. One day, when your adventures are done, you&apos;ll make a great master. Until then....</string>
  <string id="90149" soundid="139709">Bah! Humility is overrated. I will offer something more than thanks. Before I leave, I&apos;ll teach you a style I learned in the spirit world.</string>
  <string id="90150" soundid="139710">Of course you don&apos;t. Ha! But I will offer something more than thanks. Before I leave, I&apos;ll teach you a style I learned in the spirit world.</string>
  <string id="90151" soundid="139711">Did I say that was it? You are so impatient! I have one more thing to offer you. Before I leave, I&apos;ll teach you a style I learned in the spirit world.</string>
  <string id="90152" soundid="139712">I was afraid to use it against Smiling Hawk. If he had stolen it from me, he would have been almost unstoppable.</string>
  <string id="90153" soundid="139713">Well? Are you interested in learning, or are you just going to stand there?</string>
  <string id="90154" soundid="139714">Watch and learn. If you are as good as you seem, I should only have to show you once.</string>
  <string id="90155" soundid="139715">The style you just learned is very rare. Its original master died centuries ago, but the spirits know it, and now you do as well.</string>
  <string id="90156" soundid="139716">I must be going. First Brother Kai will never truly be master until I am gone. The students must follow him, and him alone.</string>
  <string id="90157" soundid="139717">I would speak with you alone Master Radiant, before you go.</string>
  <string id="90158" soundid="139718">If you wait outside, I will join you in a minute. I have something I would like to offer you in thanks for your help.</string>
  <string id="90159" soundid="139719">Good luck to you, as well. You&apos;ll need it.</string>
  <string id="90160" soundid="139720">Goodbye, and good luck. You&apos;ll need it.</string>
  <string id="90161" soundid="139721">What has happened here?</string>
  <string id="90162">I won&apos;t let anything happen to your son.</string>
  <string id="90163" soundid="154918"></string>
  <string id="90164" soundid="154919"></string>
  <string id="90165" soundid="154920"></string>
  <string id="90167" soundid="139727">If there&apos;s one thing I&apos;ve learned since I died, it&apos;s not to take yourself too seriously. It can all end in an instant, and then it&apos;s too late to enjoy your life.</string>
  <string id="90168" soundid="139728">Dead and buried. Food for the worms, as they say. Now you&apos;ll be wondering why the school still follows a dead master, hmm?</string>
  <string id="90169" soundid="139729">Ha! I don&apos;t know about great, but yes, I am a ghost. Food for the worms, as they say. Now you&apos;ll be wondering why the school still follows a dead master, hmm?</string>
  <string id="90170" soundid="139730">I choose to remain in my room for reasons beyond my... appearance.</string>
  <string id="90171" soundid="139731">My spirit could not leave this place, due to the way I was killed. First Brother and I keep my death a secret, well he and Second Brother, until his recent demise.</string>
  <string id="90172" soundid="139732">The other students just think I&apos;m an irritable old curmudgeon who doesn&apos;t like to be disturbed... not too far from the truth. But no doubt you&apos;re wondering how I died.</string>
  <string id="90173" soundid="139733">Good. It&apos;s nice to have an eager listener, unlike some people who nod their head and pretend to listen. Wouldn&apos;t you say, First Brother?</string>
  <string id="90174" soundid="139734">Too bad. If you&apos;re not interested, just nod your head and pretend to listen, like First Brother does when I go on about the way things used to be.</string>
  <string id="90175">I&apos;m not going to be beaten!</string>
  <string id="90177" soundid="139737">Ha! I&apos;m the master of this school! When I speak, you certainly have nothing better to do than listen. At least First Brother will nod his head and *pretend* to listen.</string>
  <string id="90178" soundid="139738">Now, where was I? Oh yes, the story of my demise. Before Master Smiling Hawk was a master, he was Third Brother Liu.</string>
  <string id="90179" soundid="139739">He was a gifted student, although not a very good fighter. He preferred books and knowledge over combat... but his thirst for knowledge was unhealthy.</string>
  <string id="90180" soundid="139740">Smiling Hawk was never content with his place here. Eventually, he sought to move beyond his station and take what he had not yet earned.</string>
  <string id="90182" soundid="139742">Very dangerous, especially for anyone who got in his way. At any rate, Smiling Hawk turned his considerable intellect to advancing himself.</string>
  <string id="90183" soundid="139743">Ha! We all want more, otherwise we&apos;d never learn! But you miss the point... it&apos;s not the wanting, it&apos;s how you get what you want that matters.</string>
  <string id="90184" soundid="139744">Smiling Hawk was smart, but he wasn&apos;t wise. He discovered a technique that allowed him to harness another person&apos;s style and power.</string>
  <string id="90185" soundid="139745">This technique was unnatural. I reprimanded him and told him to stop dabbling with things that he could not control.</string>
  <string id="90186" soundid="139746">Of course, in my arrogance, I assumed he would obey my wise instructions. But Smiling Hawk had no intention of letting go of his newfound technique.</string>
  <string id="90187" soundid="139747">An excellent point, and one that very few people grasp. You may yet prove to be an excellent student.</string>
  <string id="90188" soundid="139748">If you don&apos;t know, then I doubt I can explain it to you. Some people possess power, while others are possessed by it. Smiling Hawk fell into the latter group.</string>
  <string id="90189" soundid="139749">Ha! You&apos;re picking up First Brother&apos;s bad habits.</string>
  <string id="90190" soundid="139750">At any rate, Smiling Hawk decided to try out his technique on me. With my power, he could become First Brother... and more.</string>
  <string id="90194">Power is hard to gain and even harder to let go.</string>
  <string id="90196">Of course not. Why would he?</string>
  <string id="90198">[Nod head and pretend to be listening.]</string>
  <string id="90203">What a shameless act of cowardice!</string>
  <string id="90205">It sounds like Smiling Hawk was very bold and daring.</string>
  <string id="90207">Well, I think I can see where this is going.</string>
  <string id="90210">So how can we stop him?</string>
  <string id="90211">I&apos;ll deal with Smiling Hawk.</string>
  <string id="90212">His power is nothing compared to mine!</string>
  <string id="90216">Crane</string>
  <string id="90217" soundid="164309">Well, good for you. Do you want to me to bake a special dessert in your honor!</string>
  <string id="90219">I want to know more details about this problem before I go.</string>
  <string id="90220" soundid="154926">That&apos;s one of them there.</string>
  <string id="90225">A wise choice. Kai will make an excellent master.</string>
  <string id="90226">Congratulations, First Brother. Or should I say, Master?</string>
  <string id="90229">So, *I* defeated Smiling Hawk and *he* gets to be master?</string>
  <string id="90232">Your thanks is enough.</string>
  <string id="90234">That&apos;s okay. I didn&apos;t really want to be a master.</string>
  <string id="90236">After all I&apos;ve done, that&apos;s it?</string>
  <string id="90239">Yes, I&apos;m very interested.</string>
  <string id="90240">Finally, something for all my work.</string>
  <string id="90245">Farewell and good luck, Master Radiant.</string>
  <string id="90246">Goodbye, then.</string>
  <string id="90248" soundid="156146">I don&apos;t think you should go in there. The Serpent is no good for anybody. I&apos;ll... be around if you need me.</string>
  <string id="90249" soundid="154928"></string>
  <string id="90250" soundid="154929">Damn it! Get him... and don&apos;t be gentle!</string>
  <string id="90251">I&apos;m afraid your men won&apos;t be joining you anytime soon.</string>
  <string id="90252" soundid="154931">What? So it&apos;s true. Master Radiant suspected as much. We must find a way to stop Smiling Hawk.</string>
  <string id="90253">So... you&apos;re dead?</string>
  <string id="90255">The great Master Radiant is a... ghost?</string>
  <string id="90257">I wondered why you never appeared outside your room.</string>
  <string id="90260">Yes, I would like to know.</string>
  <string id="90262">No, I&apos;m not really interested.</string>
  <string id="90264">Dong Ping needs to get Zhong the Ox Carrier to leave the Teahouse. He needs Zhong to help him with the manual chores on his farm. If Zhong is hurt or killed, Dong Ping will be ruined.</string>
  <string id="90265">Zhong the Ox Carrier</string>
  <string id="90266">I suppose. I&apos;ve got nothing better to do.</string>
  <string id="90270" soundid="154932">Go. Challenge Third Brother. I will speak with Master Radiant.</string>
  <string id="90271">That&apos;s a dangerous path to tread.</string>
  <string id="90273">What&apos;s wrong with wanting more?</string>
  <string id="90275">I see. Go on.</string>
  <string id="90277" soundid="139837">Do you really think we&apos;ll find Second Brother here in the city?</string>
  <string id="90278" soundid="139838">Why ask me? I don&apos;t even want to be here. Second Brother probably decided he didn&apos;t want to listen to Master Radiant anymore, and left to get some peace.</string>
  <string id="90279" soundid="139839">Never! Second Brother is devoted to Master Radiant. If anything, I suspect Master Smiling Hawk had something to do with his disappearance.</string>
  <string id="90280" soundid="139840">What? You dare accuse Master Smiling Hawk?</string>
  <string id="90281" soundid="139841">Quiet, you worms! You&apos;re here to look for Second Brother, not bicker like school children. Now get moving.</string>
  <string id="90286" soundid="139846">You&apos;re a fool if you believe what Master Smiling Hawk teaches. Brute force is not always the best way to win a battle.</string>
  <string id="90287" soundid="139847">Oh, and Master Radiant&apos;s ways are better? I don&apos;t think so. Brute force *is* the only way to get what you want, and I can prove it.</string>
  <string id="90288" soundid="139848">How?</string>
  <string id="90289" soundid="139849">I&apos;ll show you.</string>
  <string id="90290" soundid="151801">I expect there will already be enough chaos to go around without your... talents.</string>
  <string id="90295" soundid="139855">Y... you! You&apos;re back! Have you decided to help me? My daughter... she won&apos;t last long, I fear.</string>
  <string id="90296">I&apos;ll find a liver for you.</string>
  <string id="90302">You knew that ghost?</string>
  <string id="90306">It was a woman?</string>
  <string id="90307">You owe me for this.</string>
  <string id="90309" soundid="145573">Ahhh... then you shall learn the depths to which I have sunk!</string>
  <string id="90310">You&apos;re robbing her grave?</string>
  <string id="90312">You&apos;re *married*?</string>
  <string id="90315">What a nice home life you must have.</string>
  <string id="90320" soundid="146309">[Failure] Why? All he does is ask for money and try to line his own pockets with my hard work! I won&apos;t let him take this from me! I won&apos;t!</string>
  <string id="90322">I guess you&apos;re going to have to die, Elder Fong.</string>
  <string id="90323">I won&apos;t kill him. We&apos;re leaving. *Now*.</string>
  <string id="90324">Actually, I think I&apos;ll just kill you both.</string>
  <string id="90326" soundid="146321">That one didn&apos;t listen to me; I hope you have more sense.</string>
  <string id="90327" soundid="163963">No, I *was* weak, otherwise I would have ignored you by the river. I&apos;m going to pay for my crimes, but there&apos;s one thing I have to do first. I have to kill you.</string>
  <string id="90328">Do you deserve to be standing here any more than her, Captain?</string>
  <string id="90331" soundid="146326">If you came here because of the rich reward on my head, you may even know him. Captain Sen of the Imperial Army is my quarry. I must make him pay for that boy&apos;s life.</string>
  <string id="90332" soundid="146327">You know him, clearly.</string>
  <string id="90333" soundid="146328">Until now, I wasn&apos;t sure how I would approach him, but you may have provided the answer.</string>
  <string id="90334" soundid="146329">If you help me, I know how I can reach Sen. You need merely to escort me to his station by the gate.  A &quot;subdued&quot; prisoner could get close enough to deal with Sen.</string>
  <string id="90335" soundid="146330">Once I have dealt with him, you shall have your bounty. I couldn&apos;t let you be implicated in my final murder.</string>
  <string id="90336" soundid="146331">They do not call me the Mournful Blade because I enjoy what I do. Years of remembering the first time I &quot;let it go,&quot; have caused me to develop a conscience.</string>
  <string id="90337" soundid="146332">Why else ask this boon of you? One last chance to do something right, before one of the hunters finally catches me.</string>
  <string id="90338" soundid="146333">I have only one thing left to &quot;try.&quot;</string>
  <string id="90339" soundid="146334">Let&apos;s go write an ending to my tale.</string>
  <string id="90340" soundid="146335">I would do the same thing in your place. The prudent, efficient thing. Let us see who proves the stronger.</string>
  <string id="90341" soundid="146336">Sen is dead. Dead like that poor boy we let wash away. I should have made him suffer more.</string>
  <string id="90342" soundid="146337">Stranger, I cannot thank you enough. I have touched a thousand lives with my crimes, and yet now I feel some peace. It is time my story ended.</string>
  <string id="90343" soundid="146338">I have only one more favor to ask. Face me now and grant me an hon... no, there is no honor left for me. Just grant me an end.</string>
  <string id="90344" soundid="146339">You can&apos;t be the one to let Aishi the Mournful Blade walk free. That would cast undeserved suspicion upon you, and *that* crime I will not commit.</string>
  <string id="90345" soundid="146340">I have been waiting for this moment for years.</string>
  <string id="90346" soundid="146341">We are kindred spirits. Thank you.</string>
  <string id="90347" soundid="146342">Face me, and let this battle be glorious enough that the city will talk of it for generations!</string>
  <string id="90348" soundid="146343">I have a tale to finish. I see no need to tell it to anyone but myself.</string>
  <string id="90349" soundid="146344">There is a price on my head. It may be crusted with silver, but it will not be easily collected.</string>
  <string id="90350" soundid="146345">Likewise.</string>
  <string id="90351" soundid="146346">Stranger, if you continue to talk to me, I will stand up and face you. If that happens, our meeting will end with one of our deaths.</string>
  <string id="90352" soundid="146347">So be it.</string>
  <string id="90353" soundid="146348">This woman has looked death in the eye and refused to blink. She is... strong.</string>
  <string id="90354" soundid="146349">I&apos;ve heard of Aishi before. Whatever happens, tales of her have earned my respect.</string>
  <string id="90355" soundid="146350">I would play no games with this woman if I were you.</string>
  <string id="90356" soundid="146351">You are not what I expected. Harmony surrounds you and flows out into the world as you pass.</string>
  <string id="90357" soundid="146352">You are far from the worst I&apos;ve met, but you are not at peace with your world. </string>
  <string id="90358" soundid="146353">You are like me. We revel in chaos and discord. I, however, have made a decision that will restore my balance.</string>
  <string id="90359" soundid="146354">I have a story I would share willingly with you, if you would hear it.</string>
  <string id="90360" soundid="146355">That is fair. I would not dirty my ears listening to a murderer if I were you either. It was a fool&apos;s hope.</string>
  <string id="90361" soundid="146356">I have a story that must be told, but I do not think you are the one to hear it.</string>
  <string id="90362" soundid="146357">I am tempted to tell it to you, but I wish the right person to hear it.</string>
  <string id="90366">Ghost</string>

  <string id="90372">Who are you?</string>

  <string id="90376">Now that you mention extra silver, that&apos;s Yukong right there.</string>
  <string id="90377">You&apos;re just what I was looking for.</string>

  <string id="90386">You declare it false before giving it a chance? Perhaps you are beyond redemption.</string>

  <string id="90394">If you save her life, you may be redeemed.</string>
  <string id="90402">A sacrifice from you could change all that.</string>
  <string id="90403">I will put you to rest, then!</string>

  <string id="90418">I don&apos;t need your praise. I&apos;m just here for the silver.</string>
  <string id="90422">I&apos;m interested. Tell me what you need done.</string>
  <string id="90429">You&apos;ve got a deal.</string>
  <string id="90430">If you&apos;ll hold to your earlier offer of more generous rewards, I&apos;ll do it.</string>
  <string id="90431">I&apos;m too good for standard rates. Offer me something better.</string>
  <string id="90432">[Charm] Surely this money doesn&apos;t come out of your pocket. The Empire won&apos;t miss a few extra coins.</string>
  <string id="90434">[Intimidation] From the sounds of it, you bargain the army&apos;s money away pretty often. Who would I talk to about that?</string>
  <string id="90436">[Intuition] If everyone else bargains, you must have extra silver set aside for me, too.</string>
  <string id="90438">At that price, I&apos;m happy to help.</string>
  <string id="90440">Forget it. I&apos;ll do it for the normal fee.</string>
  <string id="90443">Let&apos;s not discuss the bounties quite yet.</string>
  <string id="90444">I&apos;m not interested right now.</string>
  <string id="90445">Just answer some questions for me.</string>
  <string id="90446">I have a bounty I wish to collect.</string>
  <string id="90448">The poor deserve your protection, too.</string>
  <string id="90450">Whatever, I&apos;m just here for the silver.</string>
  <string id="90451">There are more efficient ways of eliminating peasants.</string>
  <string id="90453">Communion of the Stream</string>
  <string id="90454" soundid="140025">I should have killed you sooner. You had such promise, but in the end you were just like Second Brother. Soon you will share his fate, as well.</string>
  <string id="90455" soundid="140026">Fortunately, I do not require you to be afraid in order to kill you. You can die in ignorance, like Master Radiant before you. But for what?</string>
  <string id="90456" soundid="140027">Goodbye.</string>
  <string id="90457" soundid="140028">Thank you, Third Brother. That is all.</string>
  <string id="90458" soundid="140029">You are dismissed!</string>
  <string id="90459" soundid="140030">Yes, Master Smiling Hawk.</string>
  <string id="90460" soundid="140031">So, you are the new student I have heard so much about. Rarely does someone so young display the ability that you have shown.</string>
  <string id="90461" soundid="140032">I noticed that you did not come from one of our usual schools. Do you mind if I ask you who your real master is?</string>
  <string id="90462" soundid="140033">I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve heard of him. Nevertheless, he obviously taught you well.</string>
  <string id="90463" soundid="140034">Ha! In fact, it is my business, but what of it? If I really wanted to know, I could find out easily enough. I did not mean to offend you by asking.</string>
  <string id="90464" soundid="140035">You have talent, and with Second Brother&apos;s death we have need of a new brother.</string>
  <string id="90465">Lucky Cho</string>
  <string id="90466" soundid="140037">I asked him to do something for me. He refused.</string>
  <string id="90467" soundid="140038">No? Then what interests you? Wealth, power... everyone has a price.</string>
  <string id="90468" soundid="140039">An interesting thought, though that wouldn&apos;t solve my problem. No, we already have two masters here, and that&apos;s one too many.</string>
  <string id="90469" soundid="140040">Let me be blunt. Master Radiant is holding this school back. He&apos;s holding *me* back. Radiant is weak. He follows the way of harmony; his methods are slow and pitiful.</string>
  <string id="90470" soundid="140041">This school belongs to me! I want Master Radiant removed, and you&apos;re the one to do it. You have certain abilities that will enable you to defeat my rival.</string>
  <string id="90471" soundid="140042">I would deal with it myself... if I could. However, Radiant is a unique problem... and you are the solution.</string>
  <string id="90472" soundid="140043">Master Radiant is... resistant to my style. But you... you are something different, I could sense it as soon as you arrived.</string>
  <string id="90473" soundid="140044">Ha! I cannot deal with Radiant... and Third Brother is no where near as powerful as I am. No... you have something that neither of us have... I can sense it.</string>
  <string id="90474" soundid="140045">You are the only one here capable of defeating Master Radiant. And rest assured, I will reward you extremely well for ridding me of him.</string>
  <string id="90475" soundid="140046">To begin with, you&apos;ll have to deal with First Brother Kai. Destroy him, and you&apos;ll be left only with Radiant, but together they would be too powerful.</string>
  <string id="90476" soundid="140047">So, First Brother is already winning you over I see. He is pathetic, and so is his precious master.</string>
  <string id="90477" soundid="140048">Do as I ask, and I will teach you things that no one else can. I also have a few rare items that should appeal to you.</string>
  <string id="90478" soundid="140049">Simply kill First Brother and Master Radiant. The task is straightforward.</string>
  <string id="90479" soundid="140050">You are a fool! You could have had everything. Instead, you will not survive your match with Third Brother. I will see to it. Now get out!</string>
  <string id="90480" soundid="140051">Do not return until First Brother and Master Radiant are dead.</string>
  <string id="90481" soundid="140052">With only you to stop me, I&apos;m afraid there will be no other choice.</string>
  <string id="90483" soundid="140054">I will give you one chance to change your mind. Now that you&apos;ve seen what Radiant truly is... help me remove him and I will reward you.</string>
  <string id="90484" soundid="140055">I liked you, and I had so hoped we could come to some sort of... agreement. But I suppose that just won&apos;t...</string>
  <string id="90485" soundid="140056">...work.</string>
  <string id="90486" soundid="140057">Now I will give you a demonstration of true skill.</string>
  <string id="90487" soundid="140058">Unfortunately, you won&apos;t be around long enough to learn from it.</string>
  <string id="90488">Understand the Way of the Closed Fist</string>
  <string id="90489" soundid="140060">He&apos;s attacking Master Smiling Hawk!</string>
  <string id="90490" soundid="140061">She&apos;s attacking Master Smiling Hawk!</string>
  <string id="90491">If you wish to aid Scholar Six Heavens, it seems you will have to prove yourself a follower of the Way of the Closed Fist and then talk to him again in Tien&apos;s Landing.</string>
  <string id="90492" soundid="154552"></string>
  <string id="90493" soundid="154561">I know your kind. Assassin!</string>
  <string id="90494" soundid="140065">Master Smiling Hawk... you killed him!</string>
  <string id="90495" soundid="140066">What? No! First Brother sent me to find you. He was worried Master Smiling Hawk&apos;s followers might overwhelm you. I can see that isn&apos;t the case.</string>
  <string id="90496" soundid="140067">Master Radiant and First Brother are waiting for you. I&apos;ll go tell them that you survived.</string>
  <string id="90497" soundid="140068">Very impressive. Your skills are powerful and... unique. I can&apos;t tell what it is exactly, but it certainly seems to serve you well. Come, we must speak privately.</string>
  <string id="90498" soundid="140069">At last, I can rule this school like it was meant to be ruled. No more of that interfering old man. I&apos;ve always preferred his room to mine as well. This will do nicely.</string>
  <string id="90499" soundid="140070">And you... you have certainly earned a share of the spoils. Take whatever you find in Master Radiant&apos;s room.</string>
  <string id="90500" soundid="140071">You have earned your reward, but I have some... terms. You must agree to remove yourself as a student of the Black Leopard School.</string>
  <string id="90501" soundid="140072">Do you really need to ask? I would be a fool to give you such power and then allow you to remain a student here. I just gained control, I will not give it up to you.</string>
  <string id="90502" soundid="140073">I didn&apos;t? It must have slipped my mind at the time. Nevertheless, these are the terms.</string>
  <string id="90503" soundid="162120">Good bye, and good fortune to you.</string>
  <string id="90504" soundid="140075">My debt is paid, and now you must go. Take what you can from Master Radiant&apos;s room on the way out. And remember, you are no longer a student here.</string>
  <string id="90505">I&apos;m not afraid of you, Smiling Hawk!</string>
  <string id="90507">You said you had some items of interest.</string>
  <string id="90508">I certainly hope you have something better to offer me!</string>
  <string id="90509">Why must I quit the school?</string>
  <string id="90510">You said nothing about terms!</string>
  <string id="90511">I&apos;ve no more interest in your school. Give me my reward.</string>
  <string id="90512" soundid="154718">Master Smiling Hawk&apos;s sole advantage is stealing others&apos; power, but he can&apos;t steal from me what he&apos;s already stolen, or so he believes.</string>
  <string id="90518">Master Li of Two Rivers.</string>
  <string id="90520">Why do you want to know?</string>
  <string id="90521">That&apos;s none of your business.</string>
  <string id="90523" soundid="154562">I&apos;ve heard a rumor that the man leading the bandits seemed to know Master Li, but I really couldn&apos;t say why.</string>
  <string id="90524">What happened to Second Brother?</string>
  <string id="90526">I&apos;m not interested in becoming Second Brother.</string>
  <string id="90528">Forget it! I want to be master!</string>
  <string id="90531">Deal with this yourself. I want no part of it.</string>
  <string id="90533">Why do you need me to help you?</string>
  <string id="90535">Why not get Third Brother to do it for you?</string>
  <string id="90538">I would never hurt First Brother Kai or Master Radiant.</string>
  <string id="90540">And what do I get in return for all of this?</string>
  <string id="90541">I&apos;m starting to like the sound of this.</string>
  <string id="90543">No. I would rather die than help you!</string>
  <string id="90544">I&apos;ll do it, but I expect to be paid well.</string>
  <string id="90545">I can&apos;t allow you to remain master of this school!</string>
  <string id="90547">Why do you hate Radiant so much?</string>
  <string id="90548" soundid="154563">It&apos;s scary to think they came here with a purpose, though. Why don&apos;t you ask Master Li?</string>
  <string id="90549">I&apos;d rather die!</string>
  <string id="90550">You are crazy if you think I&apos;d join you.</string>
  <string id="90551">All right. I&apos;ll help you, but I expect to be well paid.</string>
  <string id="90559">Do you have any idea why someone would be looking for Master Li?</string>
  <string id="90561" soundid="154566">Oh, I know. That rumor spread very quickly, though not many people want to talk about it. It&apos;s quite disturbing, so some people prefer to pretend they never heard it.</string>
  <string id="90562">My fear is strong!</string>
  <string id="90563">What about it? Do you wish to defend his honor?</string>
  <string id="90564">I could not let him ruin the school. Will you be joining him?</string>
  <string id="90565">He chose his fate. Attack me and your fate will be similar.</string>
  <string id="90569">Default Settings</string>
  <string id="90570">Yukong didn&apos;t seem like that bad a guy.</string>
  <string id="90571">Just pass some of the motivation my way and I&apos;ll be happy.</string>
  <string id="90572" soundid="140150">No. Losing an exceptionally talented servant like you is of no benefit to me, even if acolytes are expendable. They die often in the machinations between masters.</string>
  <string id="90573" soundid="140151">You are perceptive. It is a tricky matter and therefore a good test for an otherwise expendable acolyte. Your kind die often in the machinations between masters.</string>
  <string id="90574" soundid="140152">The politics of the Lotus Assassin order are complicated. It is all right if murder is *suspected*, so long as it appears deserved because of incompetence.</string>
  <string id="90575">Miss Chan Banished</string>
  <string id="90576" soundid="140154">That is your task to figure out, acolyte! This is a dangerous place. Find a way for him to have an accident that disgraces him. I, of course, must not be implicated.</string>
  <string id="90577" soundid="140155">I am your master here. Do this and you will be favored. This is a dangerous place, it should be simple for Shin to have an accident that does not implicate me.</string>
  <string id="90579" soundid="140157">Proceed, but do not waste my time.</string>
  <string id="90580" soundid="140158">I will hear you.</string>
  <string id="90581" soundid="140159">Shards infuse the golems with life. Souls are extracted from the vessel that holds them, whether a corpse or slave, and sealed within a crystal shard.</string>
  <string id="90582" soundid="140160">The more recent and brutal the death, the more effective the golem. Our soul extraction process is deliberately painful.</string>
  <string id="90583" soundid="140161">Essence gems are trinkets that can focus minimal amounts of chi. There are very few people who can make use of them effectively.</string>
  <string id="90584" soundid="140162">Golems are utterly obedient, but that does not mean they are always easy to control. In great numbers there can be... discord.</string>
  <string id="90585" soundid="140163">Jade Golems are infused with spirit shards made of multiple souls. They are highly ordered servants, and they serve as pacifiers for other golems.</string>
  <string id="90586" soundid="140164">One or two golems can be controlled by will alone, but an army requires these jade intermediaries to maintain order. Such numbers are dangerous without a lieutenant.</string>
  <string id="90587" soundid="140165">I do not know. Hundreds? More? Many are here, waiting for a Jade Golem to command them. In the end, we will replace the weaklings of the Imperial Army entirely.</string>
  <string id="90588" soundid="140166">Imagine it, acolyte. An army of loyal, nearly indestructible golems, dedicated to enforcing the will of the Emperor under Death&apos;s Hand. A beautiful sight.</string>
  <string id="90589" soundid="140167">You already know enough about him. He is insufferable, concerned only about his own advancement. He sabotages my efforts at every turn.</string>
  <string id="90590" soundid="140168">When he is gone, I will ascend in rank, and I will reward acolytes that are loyal to me. Perhaps I will even introduce you to Grand Inquisitor Jia in the heart of the fortress.</string>
  <string id="90591" soundid="140169">He is no longer a concern, thanks to your efforts.</string>
  <string id="90592" soundid="140170">Remember your tasks, acolyte. Create a spirit shard in the extraction chamber for the Jade Golem, and find a creative way to kill and disgrace Master Shin.</string>
  <string id="90593" soundid="140171">Finish your task, acolyte. Oversee the creation of a spirit shard in the Soul Extraction chamber.</string>
  <string id="90594" soundid="140172">Finish the task I have given, acolyte. Find a creative way to disgrace and kill Master Shin.</string>
  <string id="90595" soundid="140173">Ah, that is true. I like that you do not suffer formality. I have struggled under the weight of the same thing from others, myself.</string>
  <string id="90597" soundid="140175">Well done, acolyte. I knew it was best to keep your mind intact. When you finish making the Jade Golem spirit shard, I will introduce you to Grand Inquisitor Jia.</string>
  <string id="90598" soundid="140176">The inner chambers are not usually accessible to acolytes, but you have proven a valuable ally. You will go far in the Lotus Assassins.</string>
  <string id="90599" soundid="140177">So, you are done with the extractor. That spirit shard will allow the Jade Golem to control a battalion of clay golems. Eliminate Shin, and I will present you to Jia.</string>
  <string id="90600" soundid="140178">Yes, acolyte? Why have you chosen to disturb me, instead of working on the tasks I have set before you?</string>
  <string id="90601" soundid="140179">Yes, I am aware. When you have finished your other task for me, I will let you present it in the inner sanctum of the fortress.</string>
  <string id="90602" soundid="140180">That will be a great honor for a Lotus Acolyte. You may even meet Grand Inquisitor Jia.</string>
  <string id="90603" soundid="140181">Hmm... an interesting idea. It has happened before, and the victim was certainly considered a fool for letting it occur, but it is impossible.</string>
  <string id="90604" soundid="140182">You may as well try and drop one of the golems on him. He would never be so distracted as to enter the press. We are Lotus *Assassins,* after all.</string>
  <string id="90605" soundid="140183">A possibility, but Shin does not leave the inner chambers often. Only to inspect the new slave shipments arriving in the Hall of Induction.</string>
  <string id="90606" soundid="140184">You would have to close a great many eyes to get away with an assassination in the hall and moving the body to the press, but it would certainly send a message.</string>
  <string id="90607" soundid="140185">The hall cleared of all witnesses, the press operator distracted, and the slave shipment stopped outside in the Necropolis before it arrives? A daunting list of tasks.</string>
  <string id="90609" soundid="143144">We have warriors across the Empire, and other Jade Golems that are not corrupted. You have diminished us, but it is not a mortal wound.</string>
  <string id="90610" soundid="140188">A terrible tragedy has reached my ears. Our respected Master Shin has met his end in a rather embarrassing fashion.</string>
  <string id="90611" soundid="140189">I came quickly after hearing of his stumble. Perhaps it was the cold of the sanctum that made him careless and dulled his senses.</string>
  <string id="90612" soundid="140190">Open the press.</string>
  <string id="90613" soundid="140191">How unfortunate. I will make certain he is dead, but not from too close. I don&apos;t want to share his tragically foolish fate.</string>
  <string id="90614" soundid="140192">Yes, quite dead. How unfortunate.</string>
  <string id="90615" soundid="140193">We should honor our fallen comrade, but I am distracted by thoughts of who will take his place. I think the choice is obvious.</string>
  <string id="90616" soundid="140194">Master Shin is coming to inspect the new slaves in the Hall of Induction. If you have a plan in place to entrap him, go there now!</string>
  <string id="90617" soundid="140195">Very good, acolyte, very good, indeed. You have secured a promising future for your master despite some minor disruptions.</string>
  <string id="90618" soundid="140196">I trust I have made myself clear?</string>
  <string id="90619" soundid="140197">Yes, Master Shin.</string>
  <string id="90620" soundid="140198">I thought so. Do not let anything delay you further. It would be a shame to once more remind Grand Inquisitor Jia how incompetent you are.</string>
  <string id="90621" soundid="140199">Yes, an absolute shame.</string>
  <string id="90622" soundid="140200">What do you want? So help me, if you are just some wandering slave, I&apos;ll have you butchered to color the clay golems.</string>
  <string id="90623" soundid="140201">Wait, no, you are the one I was told to expect. A new recruit. Hmph, as if I don&apos;t have enough trouble watching over the other fools in my care.</string>
  <string id="90624" soundid="140202">Your best is no longer the limit of what we expect, despite what you have achieved elsewhere. You will be reconstructed into the perfect obedient slave.</string>
  <string id="90625" soundid="140203">If you survive, then you will be an Assassin. For now, you are a Lotus Acolyte, and your life expectancy is not long.</string>
  <string id="90626" soundid="140204">Follow me down to the central chambers when you are ready to begin your indoctrination. Do *not* keep me waiting. A battalion of golems stand idle.</string>
  <string id="90627" soundid="140205">You are no Assassin yet, fool, despite what you may have achieved outside. Here we strip you down to nothing and rebuild you as we like.</string>
  <string id="90629" soundid="140207">Damn the heavens for the fools I lead! I am destined to suffer for their incompetence, and I have one man to blame for it! Shin!</string>
  <string id="90630" soundid="140208">The old scorpion had one of his followers shatter a spirit shard during training. There are ghosts everywhere! I&apos;ve lost eight slaves and three acolytes to them.</string>
  <string id="90631" soundid="140209">You, new-blood! Get over there and occupy those ghosts until I can get real Lotus Assassins to clean them up. Golem production cannot be delayed by this!</string>
  <string id="90632" soundid="140210">Go on, it&apos;s your first sacrifice for your new life. I&apos;m sure it will be glorious.</string>
  <string id="90633" soundid="140211">I gave you an order, acolyte! Go spill your new blood on those ghosts while I get some real Assassins in here!</string>
  <string id="90634" soundid="140212">You... you live. And the ghosts are gone? Well, I did not expect this. It would seem that I have a competent acolyte for once. Interesting.</string>
  <string id="90635" soundid="140213">Recruits are rarely of use before we strip them of their outside identities, but you beg a more... interesting application. Could you be the one I have waited for?</string>
  <string id="90636" soundid="140214">I need a favored protege, someone willing to risk everything in my service. I will preserve your intellect, allow your inventive mind to remain, in exchange for two tasks. </string>
  <string id="90637" soundid="140215">Your duties would normally include a period of deprivation in a cell until every hint of self and identity was stripped away. It is a draining, brutal awakening.</string>
  <string id="90638" soundid="140216">One is your duty anyway. The other is something to secure your future at the heart of the Assassins. Lotus Acolytes are utterly expendable. You deserve better.</string>
  <string id="90639" soundid="140217">You must operate the Soul Extractor, past the room where you fought the ghosts. In the coming weeks, you will help swell the ranks of the Empire&apos;s glorious golem army.</string>
  <string id="90640" soundid="140218">Golems are fueled by the souls of the dead. The recently dead, it turns out, make far more obedient and powerful golems. Especially if brutally killed.</string>
  <string id="90641" soundid="140219">We no longer mine the Necropolis for souls that linger near their resting place. We butcher slaves instead, and extract their souls into spirit shards.</string>
  <string id="90644">It cannot be as simple as that, or he would be dead now.</string>
  <string id="90646">Return to Shen and tell him Miss Chan has been banished.</string>
  <string id="90647">How do I go about doing that?</string>
  <string id="90648">I am not certain I want to do your dirty work.</string>
  <string id="90650">I have some questions, Master Gang.</string>
  <string id="90651">I want to ask about golems and shards.</string>
  <string id="90652">What are spirit shards? Are they similar to essence gems?</string>
  <string id="90655">What is so important about the Jade Golem?</string>
  <string id="90658">How many golems have been produced?</string>
  <string id="90660">Let&apos;s go back to my other questions.</string>
  <string id="90661">Tell me about Master Shin.</string>
  <string id="90663">Goodbye for now.</string>
  <string id="90664">A simple matter. What else?</string>
  <string id="90665">You speak as if I have a choice. You can order what you want.</string>
  <string id="90667">So, favored students are spared some pain? I agree.</string>
  <string id="90668">I am no mere student. I earned my place here.</string>
  <string id="90672">I have the spirit shard for the Jade Golem.</string>
  <string id="90674">Master Shin would be disgraced if killed by the golem press.</string>
  <string id="90676">Then I will kill him and put him in there.</string>
  <string id="90679">He could meet his end elsewhere. Something could be arranged.</string>
  <string id="90680" soundid="143145">Death&apos;s Hand will be here soon. You will be my gift to him, drawn as you were by your precious amulet. Live or die, the will of the Emperor be done!</string>
  <string id="90690">I will endeavor to serve as best I can.</string>
  <string id="90693">You will find me a competent Assassin, I assure you.</string>
  <string id="90700">I welcome the compliment. I hope I serve you well.</string>
  <string id="90703">I will serve as needed, Master Gang.</string>
  <string id="90707">And what is the second task, Master Gang?</string>
  <string id="90708">You wish me to take the blame for such an act?</string>
  <string id="90715" soundid="140299">When the Jade Golem is done, have a normal spirit shard made and replace this clay golem. The ranks must be full when the Jade Golem is activated.</string>
  <string id="90716" soundid="143109">Thank you.</string>
  <string id="90717">No, you are free.</string>
  <string id="90720" soundid="140306">I am the Watcher, and this is the fortress of the Lotus Assassins. It was built amid the graves of a thousand generations, the tomb of the Emperor at its core.</string>
  <string id="90721" soundid="140307">Come, I will show you to the Hall of Induction. If you have servants, they will be allowed to accompany you, but you are responsible for their actions.</string>
  <string id="90722" soundid="140308">Formed from the defunct Order of the Lotus, the Lotus Assassins are an extension of the Emperor, as dictated by Death&apos;s Hand and implemented by Grand Inquisitor Jia.</string>
  <string id="90723" soundid="140309">Thanks to her direction, we are becoming the face of power in the Empire. The Imperial Army will soon be stationed only at taverns and fish markets.</string>
  <string id="90724" soundid="140310">The great golem army constructed here will spread across the Empire. Our masters will be all-powerful. You will assist, if you survive. Weak recruits die quickly.</string>
  <string id="90725" soundid="140311">Master Gang is one of our trainers. He will be your master as you seek to become an Assassin. He is harsh, but his knowledge will be invaluable to you.</string>
  <string id="90726" soundid="140312">You will find him at the opposite end of the Hall of Induction, near the entrance to the central chambers. Do not keep him waiting.</string>
  <string id="90727" soundid="140313">What do you wish?</string>
  <string id="90728" soundid="140314">What would you like to know?</string>
  <string id="90729" soundid="140315">Death&apos;s Hand is the one who brings us the will of the Emperor, but Grand Inquisitor Jia rules in his absence.</string>
  <string id="90730" soundid="140316">Death&apos;s Hand rules us all. We obey him in all things, for he is the will of the Emperor. There is no more to tell. Our lives are his.</string>
  <string id="90731" soundid="140317">Grand Inquisitor Jia is the foremost acolyte of Death&apos;s Hand. She was one of the first converted from the old Order of the Lotus, and she is fearsome in her power.</string>
  <string id="90732" soundid="140318">You would be wise to never even give the *appearance* of challenging her. She takes offense easily, and even masters have been killed for displeasing her.</string>
  <string id="90733" soundid="140319">She is not *found* by just anyone. Excel in your tasks, and perhaps you will be blessed with her attention. Fail, and you will be cursed with it.</string>
  <string id="90734" soundid="140320">I will answer, but you should not delay your duties.</string>
  <string id="90735" soundid="140321">This was to be the tomb of the Emperor. It rests in the heart of the Necropolis, the accumulation of thousands of years of the Empire&apos;s dead.</string>
  <string id="90736" soundid="140322">It was the perfect place to begin constructing the utterly loyal golem forces the Emperor demanded through Death&apos;s Hand. We could harvest all the spirits we need.</string>
  <string id="90737" soundid="140323">They are the perfect soldiers: unrelenting, obedient, the ideal that all Lotus assassins aspire to achieve. Slaves that die to be golems are blessed.</string>
  <string id="90738" soundid="140324">No, you fool, we harvest *spirits.* Many linger where their body is interred, although the freshly dead produce a far more responsive golem.</string>
  <string id="90739" soundid="140325">I saw no one. Only the most skilled of our number can enter this place without my knowing. I am the Watcher.</string>
  <string id="90740" soundid="140326">May the will of Death&apos;s Hand and the Emperor guide you.</string>
  <string id="90741" soundid="140327">Go to your teacher, acolyte. Do not keep him waiting. The far end of the hall, at the entrance to the Central Chambers.</string>
  <string id="90748">I want to ask you some questions.</string>
  <string id="90749">Tell me about the leaders of the Lotus Assassins.</string>
  <string id="90750">Tell me about Death&apos;s Hand.</string>
  <string id="90751">Tell me about Grand Inquisitor Jia.</string>
  <string id="90753">Where can I find Grand Inquisitor Jia?</string>
  <string id="90754">I want to return to my questions.</string>
  <string id="90755">Tell me about this fortress and the golem army.</string>
  <string id="90757">Why are you constructing golems?</string>
  <string id="90758">Do you harvest bodies from the Necropolis?</string>
  <string id="90759">Did someone try to enter the fortress just before I did?</string>
  <string id="90760">I don&apos;t have any more questions for now.</string>
  <string id="90761">Farewell, Watcher.</string>
  <string id="90762" soundid="140348">You must be Master Gang&apos;s latest acolyte. I heard there might be a new recruit, but they typically aren&apos;t ready for service so quickly. Stripping a will can take time.</string>
  <string id="90763" soundid="140349">But, Master Gang is known for being generous to those who please him. You must be quite exceptional to be allowed into service so... directly.</string>
  <string id="90764" soundid="140350">Fight! It is our only chance!</string>
  <string id="90765" soundid="140351">Vermin! I&apos;ll kill you all!</string>
  <string id="90766">Jade Golem</string>
  <string id="90767" soundid="140484">My own demons distract me in this place, but I hold no love for your new master or the master above him. If you kill one, why not two?</string>
  <string id="90768" soundid="140354">This device is the Soul Extractor. It has a loftier name, but we are here to glorify Emperor Sun through Death&apos;s Hand, not pay tribute to some distant celestial lord.</string>
  <string id="90769" soundid="140355">It is mounted on an elevator that reaches deep into the Necropolis. Until recently we excavated bodies to extract spirits that lingered near their graves.</string>
  <string id="90770" soundid="140356">The results were... unpredictable. Now we use slaves. Freshly killed spirits make the best golems. The more painful the death, the better. The extractor is not gentle.</string>
  <string id="90771" soundid="140357">I am a Lotus Acolyte, like you. My name is unimportant. I have not yet earned the right to have a title. I must prove my worth through service here.</string>
  <string id="90772" soundid="140358">What do you want?</string>
  <string id="90773" soundid="140359">Then you should select a suitable victim for the procedure. I would recommend one of the slaves on the prison level.</string>
  <string id="90774" soundid="140360">Selecting from elsewhere could bring unfortunate results, and I would not wish to see you disgraced so early in your time with us.</string>
  <string id="90775" soundid="140361">Use the lever to select a floor, and this platform will move there. You are free to go where you wish, but I would avoid the lower mines. They are... restless.</string>
  <string id="90776" soundid="140362">What kind of questions?</string>
  <string id="90777" soundid="140363">If you must. It is a simple machine to operate. I&apos;m sure you will come to enjoy the subtle joys of it.</string>
  <string id="90778" soundid="140364">Spirits that die in trauma can linger near their mortal form. The Empire is soaked in blood; many restless dead haunt the Necropolis. But slaves produce a better result.</string>
  <string id="90779" soundid="140365">Only on the prison level. Many of the mines are impassable. The graves were never intended to be stable during excavation. Several have collapsed.</string>
  <string id="90780" soundid="140366">Much of the surrounding ground is weak. We do not march too many golems at once. Even that might shake something loose.</string>
  <string id="90781" soundid="140367">Slaves are placed in the extractor, and the extraction fluid produces exquisite agony. Focused by this pain, the soul is forced to crystallize into a spirit shard.</string>
  <string id="90782" soundid="140368">That shard is implanted in a golem, infusing it with the energy of the deceased soul. Your task is the creation of a new shard for a Jade Golem. Do not delay.</string>
  <string id="90783" soundid="140369">Your place in the ranks of the Assassins is clear. What do you want to know?</string>
  <string id="90784" soundid="140370">Death&apos;s Hand owns my soul, as he does yours and everyone else who has given themselves to him. In obedience and submission, we find our purpose.</string>
  <string id="90785" soundid="140371">He is the living will of the Emperor. Through him, we are closer to the heart of the Empire.</string>
  <string id="90786" soundid="140372">Grand Inquisitor Jia is the embodiment of the will of Death&apos;s Hand, even as *he* is the will of the Emperor. She governs us all while he is elsewhere.</string>
  <string id="90787" soundid="140373">To defy her is to defy the Empire. Death is her first and last means of education on the matter.</string>
  <string id="90788" soundid="140374">It is our home, but not for much longer. With the golem forces of the Emperor almost complete, there is little to tie us here. When the army marches, so shall we.</string>
  <string id="90789" soundid="140375">I do not imagine we will leave much behind us. The ground here is weak. Such a movement of power will likely shake the walls to their foundation.</string>
  <string id="90790" soundid="140376">You should get on with your work. Grand Inquisitor Jia is growing impatient for the Jade Golem to be completed. Select a suitable victim, and create a spirit shard.</string>
  <string id="90791" soundid="140377">What is this? Who opened the slave cells?</string>
  <string id="90793">What is this place?</string>
  <string id="90796" soundid="140485">Distractions are the key to weakness in a target. If you look to the future, Master Gang will have his plans come crashing down on him.</string>
  <string id="90799">Who are you?</string>
  <string id="90801">What do you do here?</string>
  <string id="90802">I must make a spirit shard for the Jade Golem.</string>
  <string id="90805">I want to ask you some questions.</string>
  <string id="90806">I want to ask about the extractor and spirit shards.</string>
  <string id="90807">Do corpses still have souls to extract?</string>
  <string id="90808">You store slaves here?</string>
  <string id="90810">How does the extractor function?</string>
  <string id="90812">Let&apos;s return to my other questions.</string>
  <string id="90813">Tell me about the Lotus Assassins and our leaders. </string>
  <string id="90814">Tell me about Death&apos;s Hand.</string>
  <string id="90816">Tell me about Grand Inquisitor Jia.</string>
  <string id="90818">Tell me about the fortress.</string>
  <string id="90820">Goodbye.</string>
  <string id="90828" soundid="140414">A welcome exercise, actually. We can always get more slaves.</string>
  <string id="90829" soundid="140415">The slaves in the cells are all dead. You will have to wait for new ones to be brought in from the outlying areas.</string>
  <string id="90830" soundid="140416">What? Then I will deal with them! They will not have the honor of dying for the extractor!</string>
  <string id="90831">The slaves have freed themselves. They need to be killed.</string>
  <string id="90836">Why are you here, slave?</string>
  <string id="90839">How many slaves have passed through here?</string>
  <string id="90841">I may try to help you.</string>
  <string id="90843">Goodbye.</string>
  <string id="90846">Get there on your own. I&apos;ve done enough for you.</string>
  <string id="90847">Just one. If you can&apos;t handle him, you don&apos;t deserve freedom.</string>
  <string id="90849">If you don&apos;t hurry, there will be more. Go!</string>
  <string id="90850">I will remove the guard when I am done with the extractor.</string>
  <string id="90851">The guard is dead. Go now.</string>
  <string id="90852">You were strong enough, they weren&apos;t. Thank yourself.</string>
  <string id="90853">Go before I regret letting even you live!</string>
  <string id="90854" soundid="140477">I can&apos;t let this continue! This area is my responsibility! I don&apos;t care who you are!</string>
  <string id="90855" soundid="140478"></string>
  <string id="90864" soundid="140490">So, you are the new Lotus Acolyte under Master Gang. No one else has reason to be here. He was quick to favor you. New recruits are typically held in isolation.</string>
  <string id="90865" soundid="140491">The press is simple to use. Using this machine, we can create a legion of warrior golems in a day.</string>
  <string id="90866" soundid="140643">You there! Stand aside, or risk the ire of the Lotus Assassins.</string>
  <string id="90867" soundid="140493">Death&apos;s Hand is master of us all. It is by his whim that we live and die, for his is the will of the Emperor. Obey him, or fall before his might.</string>
  <string id="90868" soundid="140644">These prisoners must be delivered to the fortress to be inspected by Master Shin. I will not allow you to make me late.</string>
  <string id="90869" soundid="140495">I will return to my tasks.</string>
  <string id="90870" soundid="140645">A fine slaughter, even if there was no challenge. I will return to our agents in the city and demand fodder of better quality.</string>
  <string id="90871" soundid="140646">If they don&apos;t deliver, perhaps I will enlist their assistance more directly. You have inspired me, acolyte. You will make a fine Assassin.</string>
  <string id="90872" soundid="140647">And why is that? Keep your reason short, or you&apos;ll be dead before you&apos;re done.</string>
  <string id="90873" soundid="140648">You are mad to test an Assassin! I&apos;ll kill you where you stand!</string>
  <string id="90874" soundid="140649">A mere acolyte will steal my work to gain favor? What are you, one of Gang&apos;s little children? I serve Master Shin, and I do not take orders from acolytes!</string>
  <string id="90875" soundid="140650"></string>
  <string id="90876" soundid="140651">[Success] You make a good point, acolyte. I am not used to your kind being so persuasive. Perhaps you *will* be a force to contend with.</string>
  <string id="90877" soundid="140652">Very well, I will let you deliver these slaves. Be certain they arrive in good order! If I suffer any loss of standing, I swear you will answer for it!</string>
  <string id="90878" soundid="140653">You have my assistance, acolyte. Do not abuse it.</string>
  <string id="90879">Master Shin</string>
  <string id="90880" soundid="140506">She is merciless, violent, and sadistic. You would do well to emulate her.</string>
  <string id="90883" soundid="143117">Er, and my efforts to accelerate his training.</string>
  <string id="90884" soundid="140658"></string>
  <string id="90885" soundid="140659"></string>
  <string id="90886" soundid="140660">A mere acolyte questions the quality of my work? I am not laughing, child. Why should I allow this?</string>
  <string id="90887" soundid="140513">This is only one step. Here we create husks, devoid of energy. Each golem needs a spirit shard to move, and a Jade Golem must guide them all.</string>
  <string id="90888" soundid="140514">For each shard, a spirit must be reduced to its essence. For a time we used those that lingered near their graves, mining them as if they were silver. No longer.</string>
  <string id="90889" soundid="140515">The recently dead make a stronger, more obedient golem, if the death is painful. With a Jade Golem guiding them, legions act as one, utterly obedient.</string>
  <string id="90890" soundid="140516">The average citizen of the Empire is worthless. They are nothing more than cattle. In this, they can at least serve some useful purpose.</string>
  <string id="90891" soundid="140517">The press is simple to operate. You select the type of body at the first station. Once the material is poured, it is funneled to the press.</string>
  <string id="90892" soundid="140518">The press serves as a mold and a kiln. In short order it can be opened and the new body is ready to be moved. The crane controls are at the end of the ramp.</string>
  <string id="90893" soundid="140519">You can experiment with each station if you want, but you may as well reduce what you produce to rubble. There are no shards to power any more golems for now.</string>
  <string id="90894" soundid="140661"></string>
  <string id="90895" soundid="140662">[Success] Hrm... they are not the best I have encountered, and Master Shin did say he needed good quality slaves for a special project.</string>
  <string id="90896" soundid="140663">Bah, I can&apos;t take the risk of earning his displeasure. You are right to warn me, acolyte. Help me dispose of these worthless sacks.</string>
  <string id="90897" soundid="140664">Ready, you lot? The good acolyte says you are so worthless you should die! I say I agree! Defend yourselves so your deaths are at least entertaining!</string>
  <string id="90898" soundid="140665">Mwaaah! Heavens help us!</string>
  <string id="90899" soundid="140666">[Failure] You fail to convince me of anything except your impudence, acolyte! I will not accept this!</string>
  <string id="90900" soundid="140667">Defend yourself, fool. I will suffer this delay no longer!</string>
  <string id="90901" soundid="140668"></string>
  <string id="90902" soundid="140669"></string>
  <string id="90903" soundid="140670">I don&apos;t know your face. You don&apos;t even bear our markings. State your intent before I end this encounter... and your life.</string>
  <string id="90904" soundid="140530">What do you want?</string>
  <string id="90906">I cannot allow this delivery to take place.</string>
  <string id="90908">[Intimidation] You do not dare insult your masters with such poor wares!</string>
  <string id="90909" soundid="140535">Grand Inquisitor Jia directs us all in the absence of Death&apos;s Hand. She is one of the few that survived the transition of the Lotus Order into the Lotus Assassins.</string>
  <string id="90911">Don&apos;t you recognize one of your own? Stand down!</string>
  <string id="90913">They will not be delivered. Abandon them or fall, slave driver!</string>
  <string id="90914">[Lie] I am an acolyte. I will deliver the slaves to gain favor.</string>
  <string id="90915">Tell me about Inquisitor Jia.</string>
  <string id="90916">[Charm] Two allies of moderate influence are stronger than one alone.</string>
  <string id="90918">Tell me about Death&apos;s Hand.</string>
  <string id="90919">Has the Emperor ever visited this fortress?</string>
  <string id="90923">Goodbye for now.</string>
  <string id="90924" soundid="143118">Shut up, Gang. Your contribution has been noted.</string>
  <string id="90925" soundid="143119">Now, we must complete the ritual. A score of clay golems stand idle without a focus. This Jade Golem will awaken them all, direct them as one.</string>
  <string id="90926" soundid="143120">Insert the spirit shard. Let this legion of immortals give glory to our masters!</string>
  <string id="90927" soundid="143121">I command you all, be ready for the orders of Death&apos;s Hand. The will of the Emperor!</string>
  <string id="90928" soundid="143122">What? What is wrong? I command you! I demand that you obey!</string>
  <string id="90929">[Intuition] Your master has enemies. You need other allies.</string>
  <string id="90931">[Intimidation] Do not question me! You want me as an ally as I ascend!</string>
  <string id="90933">I am an acolyte. These slaves are substandard. Kill them, and get more.</string>
  <string id="90935">[Charm] Just a friendly gesture to save the order the loss of a fine agent.</string>
  <string id="90941">[Intuition] Your standing will be lessened if they are considered weak.</string>
  <string id="90942" soundid="140702">What is going on here? Where are my slaves? The golems require spirit shards!</string>
  <string id="90943">Our power must be growing at an incredible rate.</string>
  <string id="90946">You kill people to make shards for the golems?</string>
  <string id="90947" soundid="140703">Attendants, do you know anything about this? Blood will flow if the extractor is left idle because of this! Someone has disobeyed my orders!</string>
  <string id="90948" soundid="140704">You... you are Gang&apos;s new acolyte. I see what is happening here. You think to promote your master by threatening me. You are bold, but foolish.</string>
  <string id="90951" soundid="140705">Was this empty hall arranged to make me vulnerable? A miscalculation. I am one of Grand Inquisitor Jia&apos;s favored! I will not fall to the likes of you!</string>
  <string id="90953">I regret that there will be no slaves delivered today, Shin.</string>
  <string id="90955">Your orders are worthless. No one is here to receive them.</string>
  <string id="90957" soundid="140711">What is this? Another acolyte feeling their way around in the dark?</string>
  <string id="90958">Lotus Acolyte Du Gah</string>
  <string id="90961">Lotus Acolyte Jin Tao</string>
  <string id="90964">If we are able to create that many golems, why haven&apos;t we?</string>
  <string id="90966" soundid="140719">Sometimes I wonder if I am ready to train with others of such skill, even in the robes of a junior student. I feel a long way from my home in the Imperial City.</string>
  <string id="90967" soundid="140593">I will instruct you on the use of the golem press and crane. Forming the golems is an honored task that elevates us above slaves and mere servants.</string>
  <string id="90968" soundid="140594">One or two golems can be controlled by will alone, but larger numbers are unwieldy. They grow confused, their wills creeping back and bringing madness.</string>
  <string id="90969" soundid="140595">Jade Golems keep order. Command a Jade Golem and you command them all. The current legion has not yet been assigned a Jade Golem.</string>
  <string id="90970" soundid="140596">Master Gang will probably order you to help with that, if he has not done so already.</string>
  <string id="90971" soundid="140597">What do you wish to know, acolyte? There is much to learn if you want to ascend in the order.</string>
  <string id="90972" soundid="140598">Beyond the veil of death, if you impose your presence uninvited. Master Gang may present you if you please him, but even he has few opportunities to appeal to her.</string>
  <string id="90973" soundid="140599">No, and there is no reason for him to. I would throw myself in the press if even his robes were discolored by the dust of the machine.</string>
  <string id="90974" soundid="140600">I have no doubt that Grand Inquisitor Jia would... extend my demise if I did not.</string>
  <string id="90975" soundid="140601">You test my patience, acolyte.</string>
  <string id="90976" soundid="140602">The Extraction Chamber is a far more interesting place to work. The screams over there are music. Here, we have only the creaking of clay.</string>
  <string id="90977" soundid="140603">Is that so? Why should I step aside for a new-blood acolyte? I have my own position to think about, and I will not be so easily replaced.</string>
  <string id="90978" soundid="140604">If you bring an order from Master Gang, I will relent, as he is my master, too. Until then, I am not moving.</string>
  <string id="90979" soundid="140605">I see. The ways of the order are mysterious and brutal. If an... opening is created away from witnesses, all of us under him will benefit. I understand.</string>
  <string id="90980" soundid="140606">I will tend to the golems that are being readied for the Jade Golem&apos;s command. I do not think I will be able to return to this room today.</string>
  <string id="90981" soundid="140607">But... a thought occurs to me: If one opening raises us all, two openings will raise us further. If something were to befall the good master....</string>
  <string id="90982" soundid="140608">Just something you might want to ponder.</string>
  <string id="90983" soundid="140609">You nearly saw one as you entered, but they are rare. Falling victim to an obvious danger like a dropped golem--or worse, the press--would take a monumental fool.</string>
  <string id="90984" soundid="140610">The machines are loud, and you can see the operator from anywhere in the room. A past victim of the press suffered more damage after the incident than during it.</string>
  <string id="90985" soundid="140611">Reputations are very important in the Lotus Assassin order. Falling victim to the press would cause a loss in status almost fatal in and of itself.</string>
  <string id="90986" soundid="140612">You do not need to know much. We can make husks right now, but there will be no more spirit shards until the Jade Golem is completed.</string>
  <string id="90987" soundid="140613">Clay golems are weaker, but can be made swiftly. Bronze golems are stronger and heavier, but they take longer to construct.</string>
  <string id="90988" soundid="140614">Jade Golems are the strongest of that size, but they are a topic all their own.</string>
  <string id="90989" soundid="140615">Perhaps, but they are constructed elsewhere and are only deployed in siege situations. True monsters to behold.</string>
  <string id="90990" soundid="140616">Very few are made. They are expensive and difficult to construct, but they are also essential. A single Jade Golem can direct and pacify a legion of others.</string>
  <string id="90993">What do you mean by &quot;direct and pacify?&quot;</string>
  <string id="90996">Tell me about the Lotus Assassins.</string>
  <string id="90997">Where can I find her?</string>
  <string id="90999">Let&apos;s return to my other questions.</string>
  <string id="91001">I need to relieve you at this post. You must leave the room.</string>
  <string id="91003">Your position depends on Master Gang&apos;s. I can raise him *if* there are no prying eyes.</string>
  <string id="91007">Master Gang would rather not be associated with what I am planning.</string>
  <string id="91008">The machine looks dangerous. Have accidents claimed any lives?</string>
  <string id="91011">Tell me about the crane and press.</string>
  <string id="91012">Tell me about the different golems.</string>
  <string id="91013">What are the different kinds of golems?</string>
  <string id="91015">Of that size? Are there larger ones?</string>
  <string id="91016">Why is the Jade Golem special?</string>
  <string id="91017" soundid="140720">You&apos;re right. Master Li would not have accepted me if he did not see potential. He measures all people carefully.</string>
  <string id="91018" soundid="140721">I haven&apos;t yet settled in. My studies in the Imperial City were far inferior to the instruction you&apos;ve had.</string>
  <string id="91019" soundid="140722">You&apos;re right. Sometimes I just feel that I&apos;m so far behind you that I may never catch up.</string>
  <string id="91020" soundid="140723">What can I do to help you?</string>
  <string id="91021" soundid="140724">Is there something you need from me?</string>
  <string id="91022" soundid="140725">Everyone is talking about Gao the Lesser&apos;s expulsion, of course. I knew he wasn&apos;t... disciplined, but that was truly out of line. There&apos;s always you, of course.</string>
  <string id="91023" soundid="140726">I haven&apos;t been here long enough to hear anything but rumors. Everyone prefers not to think about that place. I certainly don&apos;t envy you for having to go down there.</string>
  <string id="91024">Communion of the Dragon</string>
  <string id="91025" soundid="140728">I&apos;m no map maker, but I know the basics of the way the Empire is laid out. What do you want to know?</string>
  <string id="91026">Chi +5

The Spirit Monks have long used the meditation wheels lining the entryway of Dirge&apos;s inner temple to aid their meditations. Only one of the wheels operated when you meditated before them, and you gained only a small benefit from your moment of reflection.</string>
  <string id="91027" soundid="140730">It was a beautiful place to grow up: the brightest minds, the most noble houses, all the greatest warriors gather there. It&apos;s truly the most vibrant place in the world.</string>
  <string id="91028" soundid="140731">I&apos;m glad to be here, don&apos;t get me wrong. Two Rivers, though, is very... peaceful. I&apos;m used to a more hectic pace, I think. It&apos;s taking me some time to adjust.</string>
  <string id="91029">Health +5
Chi +15

With five of the ancient meditation wheels of Dirge spinning as you meditated, you soon realized that, like the amulet, the wheels were merely a training tool. You feel closer to understanding the nature of the Water Dragon than before, and with that understanding comes power. How you choose to use it remains to be seen.</string>
  <string id="91030" soundid="140733">Two Rivers is quiet... subdued. This province has a lot of rich agricultural land. Actually, fields cover pretty much everything south of the Great Southern Forest. </string>
  <string id="91031">From the scattered pages you have recovered, this tome seems to outline some sort of ritual. While the ritual deals with curses of some sort, it&apos;s hard to make out exactly what effect it might have if performed.</string>
  <string id="91032">You seem to have roughly half of the missing sections from this ancient book. From what you can piece together, the Tome of Release details a ritual that can free spirits bound to a place by a curse or other magic. If what you read is correct, this ritual might be enough to disperse the ghosts of the last Imperial Army soldiers still trapped in Dirge. You&apos;d need to find additional sections of the tome to be sure, though.</string>
  <string id="91033" soundid="140736">They consider farmers uneducated rustics, though they&apos;d use less... polite terms. They&apos;d change their tune if they could see such a skilled tutor as Master Li out here.</string>
  <string id="91034">You almost have all of the missing sections of the Tome of Release, and except for a few key elements, you could almost perform the ritual outlined within. Doing so would clearly free the spirits of the last few Imperial Army soldiers who haunt Dirge.

This section of the Tome makes it clear that the ritual must be performed at the shrine dedicated to Mah Tsung the Water&apos;s Source, one of the first Spirit Monks. Elevated to the heavens for his tireless service to the Water Dragon, his influence is said to guide the invoked magic.</string>
  <string id="91035" soundid="140738">The Empire is divided into four massive provinces. This area, largely agricultural, is the Golden Delta. To the north lies the Seat of Heaven, which holds the Imperial City.</string>
  <string id="91037" soundid="140740">In the Prosperous East, you can find port cities like Phoenix Gate. To the west lie the Hills of the Six Holy Scrolls. I know little about those two provinces, though.</string>
  <string id="91040" soundid="140743">Don&apos;t let me distract you from the people singing your praises for defeating the bandits. I should get back to my studies so I can one day match your greatness.</string>
  <string id="91041" soundid="140744">I&apos;m sorry, senior student. I must attend to my studies so as not to waste anyone&apos;s time.</string>
  <string id="91042" soundid="140745">I&apos;ve heard that Dawn Star is missing!</string>
  <string id="91043" soundid="140746">Given the way you treat some of us, I&apos;d be almost surprised if you cared, but I&apos;m not going to hold a grudge if you need my help.</string>
  <string id="91044" soundid="140747">If anyone can find her, it&apos;s you.</string>
  <string id="91045" soundid="140748">Master Li once asked me not to use the style I learned in the Imperial City. It was a fair request, so I agreed. Gao should have known better than to use a forbidden style.</string>
  <string id="91046" soundid="140749">Those bandits learned a hard lesson! Master Li is not a man to stand by while the town is attacked. Same with you. When something has to be done, you do it.</string>
  <string id="91048" soundid="140751">What would bandits want with a sleepy town like Two Rivers? They&apos;re in for a surprise if they think the school won&apos;t leap to the town&apos;s defense.</string>
  <string id="91049" soundid="140752">It is an honor to be approached by the school&apos;s most senior student. My mother had high hopes for this school when she sent me here from the capital.</string>
  <string id="91050">Do you know anything about the cavern beneath the school?</string>
  <string id="91052">What can you tell me about places other than here?</string>
  <string id="91053">Tell me about the Imperial City.</string>
  <string id="91055">It sounds like you miss it.</string>
  <string id="91057">How do you like this area?</string>
  <string id="91060">What do people from the city tend to think of this area.</string>
  <string id="91062">Let&apos;s hear about the rest of the Empire.</string>
  <string id="91072">If you are here, you belong here.</string>
  <string id="91074">Why do you doubt yourself?</string>
  <string id="91076">If you believe that you are inferior, you make it true.</string>
  <string id="91077">Stay focused and you will succeed.</string>
  <string id="91078">Your whining does nothing but waste our master&apos;s time.</string>
  <string id="91079">If you are too weak to be at this school, leave before you waste our Master&apos;s time.</string>
  <string id="91175" soundid="140884">It takes some time for their eyes and skin to adjust. For the first few weeks, they are as easy to kill as newborn kittens.</string>
  <string id="91176" soundid="140885">If we must. What do you want?</string>
  <string id="91177" soundid="140886">Leave us, acolyte.</string>
  <string id="91178" soundid="140887">What do you want, acolyte? We&apos;ve done our work for the day and don&apos;t want to be disturbed. Unless the press is broken, leave us.</string>
  <string id="91179" soundid="140888">What do you want now, acolyte? Unless the press is damaged, you have no reason to speak with us.</string>
  <string id="91180" soundid="140889">What? Which one of you idiots threw off the mixture? Bah, it doesn&apos;t matter.</string>
  <string id="91181" soundid="140890">Three days calibrating it for perfect clay husks, and some new-blood fool ruins it in an instant.</string>
  <string id="91182" soundid="140891">The supports for the mold injectors will be charred. We&apos;ll have to find a smith to forge new ones. Ugh, what a mess.</string>
  <string id="91183" soundid="140892">I don&apos;t want any of you stunted acolytes touching them. In fact, I will request that only full-fledged assassins operate the machine from now on.</string>
  <string id="91184" soundid="140893">So much wasted work. If we don&apos;t get it fixed, Jia will have us slaughtered.</string>
  <string id="91185" soundid="140894">I know, I know. We need to go to the market district and find a smith. Come on. We&apos;re wasting time.</string>
  <string id="91186" soundid="140895">I don&apos;t need you to tell me that, acolyte. I swear, I&apos;m going to recommend that your kind never touch it again.</string>
  <string id="91187" soundid="140896">That is unfortunate, because the needs of an acolyte are of little concern.</string>
  <string id="91188" soundid="140897">Our tasks are done for the day, but Grand Inquisitor Jia could request us at any time. We must be ready to respond if the golem press malfunctions.</string>
  <string id="91189" soundid="140898">Nothing short of her order or an emergency repair will move us. Step away, acolyte. You are of no concern to us.</string>
  <string id="91190" soundid="140899">You are right to marvel at its stability. It is a machine in balance. Only errors of its operators have damaged it before.</string>
  <string id="91191" soundid="140900">Several foolish acolytes were killed for damaging it. It&apos;s not so hard to use properly. All you do is work the crane and occasionally add Phoenix Oil to the Material Selector.</string>
  <string id="91192" soundid="140901">The measure of oil has been wrong too often. Kia Jong gives it out too freely. I will see to it that your kind are only given pre-measured containers of it.</string>
  <string id="91193" soundid="140902">Gang needs to better train his acolytes. You were obviously rushed through the initiation process.</string>
  <string id="91194" soundid="140903">Phoenix Oil is a viscous liquid that burns at an incredible temperature. It heats the press to cure the golem husks.</string>
  <string id="91195" soundid="140904">If there is too much in the machine, it burns too hot. Too little, and the golems crumble. The merchant brings the oil from the craftsmen of the Golden Delta.</string>
  <string id="91196" soundid="140905">You would not understand the complex balance of gears and sorcery that makes it function. Even flyers are simpler creations.</string>
  <string id="91197" soundid="140906">By the will of the Emperor, Death&apos;s Hand had it created.</string>
  <string id="91198" soundid="140907">With parts stolen from some great celestial furnace.</string>
  <string id="91199" soundid="140908">That&apos;s nonsense. Not everything our craftsmen create is stolen or gifted from somewhere else. We have the capability on our own.</string>
  <string id="91200" soundid="140909">We keep the golem press functioning. Without us, the machines could not keep up the ambitious pace that Grand Inquisitor Jia has set.</string>
  <string id="91201" soundid="140910">It takes two minds, two pairs of hands to control the inner structures of the press. You fools just see the controls. Inside the machines, it is impossibly complex.</string>
  <string id="91204">Goodbye.</string>
  <string id="91205">The press malfunctioned. Someone used too much Phoenix Oil.</string>
  <string id="91208">Will you require assistance?</string>
  <string id="91211">You better get to it, then.</string>
  <string id="91213">I need everyone out of the hall. </string>
  <string id="91216">What could cause a machine as sophisticated as the press to break down?</string>
  <string id="91219">What is Phoenix Oil? Where does it come from?</string>
  <string id="91222">Tell me about the golem press.</string>
  <string id="91223">Who built the press?</string>
  <string id="91226">What is your purpose here?</string>
  <string id="91228">Let&apos;s go back to my other questions.</string>
  <string id="91233" soundid="140942">[These are the controls for selecting which type of golem is to be made. It is locked on &quot;Clay Golem.&quot;]</string>
  <string id="91234" soundid="140943">[There is an opening in the side that looks like it accepts clay containers of some kind. Other than that, it seems quite simple.]</string>

  <string id="91236" soundid="140945">[It slides neatly into the machine. It does not take long for a malfunction to occur. The machine shuts down.]</string>
  <string id="91237" soundid="140946">[The press is blocked by an existing golem. A new one cannot be made until the previous one is moved with the crane.]</string>
  <string id="91238" soundid="140947"></string>
  <string id="91239" soundid="140948">[The controls for the mixer do not appear to be functioning. Too much Phoenix Oil was added.]</string>

  <string id="91269">[Leave the machine.]</string>
  <string id="91607" soundid="151802">A pity that the rest of us don&apos;t have the luxury of cowardice.</string>
  <string id="91608" soundid="141334">Who? I don&apos;t know anybody by that name. And I don&apos;t know anything about slave traders.</string>
  <string id="91609" soundid="141335">Don&apos;t you have something else you should be doing? I certainly do.</string>
  <string id="91610" soundid="141336">I suppose you are looking for Dawn Star? I&apos;m sorry, but I haven&apos;t seen her.</string>
  <string id="91611" soundid="141337">I wonder if you would look for any of the rest of us with the same interest. Somehow I doubt it.</string>
  <string id="91612" soundid="141338">I&apos;m surprised you don&apos;t know where she is. I would have thought you, if anyone, would know.</string>
  <string id="91613" soundid="141339">Gao was a fool to cheat. Our teacher is a kind man, but he is not soft and doesn&apos;t tolerate that kind of thing.</string>
  <string id="91614" soundid="141340">You&apos;ll face worse things than Gao in the cavern if what I&apos;ve heard is right. I hope you&apos;re ready.</string>
  <string id="91615" soundid="141341">To hear Gao tell it, he singlehandedly beat back the bandits, but I know you did the lion&apos;s share. Too bad I was stuck up here minding the younger students.</string>
  <string id="91616" soundid="141342">It would have been great to see Master Li deal with that sorcerer. We so rarely see our Master&apos;s true abilities in action.</string>
  <string id="91617" soundid="141343">I may finally get a chance to see some combat if there are truly bandits coming!</string>
  <string id="91618" soundid="141344">I&apos;m sure Master Li will be able to save Kia Min even if she&apos;s wounded, but I wonder who will salve her pride? &quot;Walking along the shore,&quot; my foot.</string>
  <string id="91619" soundid="141345">Our most senior student has a spare moment to spend with me? An honor!</string>
  <string id="91620" soundid="141346">No, wait, I shouldn&apos;t be like that. Master Li always reminds me that jealousy is a low path, and not worthy of one of his students.</string>
  <string id="91621" soundid="141347">I understand your training is almost complete. I wonder who will replace you as our &quot;example?&quot;</string>
  <string id="91622" soundid="141348">It certainly won&apos;t be me. I can&apos;t even imagine Master Li saying, &quot;You must strive to be like Lin in all things,&quot; to the others. Just the opposite, more likely.</string>
  <string id="91623" soundid="141349">That makes sense. Is that how you live your life? If so, it certainly seems to be an effective philosophy.</string>
  <string id="91624" soundid="141350">You could just be pouring honey in my ears, but that&apos;s not half as fun as other places it could go.</string>
  <string id="91625" soundid="141351">Lin, you&apos;re incorrigible.</string>
  <string id="91626" soundid="141352">Oh my, you&apos;ve gone kind of red. I shouldn&apos;t tease you like that.</string>
  <string id="91627" soundid="141353">That&apos;s easy enough for you to say. You&apos;re already the best in the school. The rest of us just stare at your back.</string>
  <string id="91628" soundid="141354">Of course, there could be worse views.</string>
  <string id="91629" soundid="141355">This from Master Li&apos;s favorite. We can&apos;t all be blessed with such favor. Any of us could have been the best in the school if we had been Master Li&apos;s first student!</string>
  <string id="91630" soundid="141356">Maybe I should spend more time training and less time worrying about where I stand in the school.  How else will I be good enough to take you down one of these days?</string>
  <string id="91631" soundid="141357">Besides, there might be bigger things to worry about. I find myself intrigued by the ghost tales that everyone&apos;s mentioning.</string>
  <string id="91632" soundid="141358">I don&apos;t need to take this. Your impending graduation has clearly gone to your head, and if you ask me, it can&apos;t come soon enough.</string>
  <string id="91633" soundid="141359">What do you need from me?</string>
  <string id="91634" soundid="141360">Something on your mind?</string>
  <string id="91635" soundid="141361">Come to think of it, he was muttering threats under his breath. That&apos;s just Gao, so I didn&apos;t think anything of it.</string>
  <string id="91636" soundid="141362">No one really knows anything about that cavern, except that Master Li has strictly forbidden us to go in there.</string>
  <string id="91637" soundid="141363">He has always said that it is a place of final testing. I hear whispered rumors that there&apos;s something horrible down there.</string>
  <string id="91638" soundid="141364">I even asked around town and there&apos;s old, old stories of masters before ours sending students into that cavern, and the students never finding their way out.</string>
  <string id="91639" soundid="141365">I don&apos;t have a clue, but I don&apos;t envy you having to go down there. Then again, you are the strongest of us, as we&apos;re so often reminded, so you&apos;ll be fine.</string>
  <string id="91640" soundid="141366">This is all rumor, mostly gossip from the people in Two Rivers.</string>
  <string id="91641" soundid="141367">As I said, no one really knows what&apos;s down there. Well, no one but you, once you tell Master Li you&apos;re ready.</string>
  <string id="91642" soundid="141368">Tales of people being haunted by loved ones, and mad ghosts attacking people on the roads or even in their homes.</string>
  <string id="91643" soundid="141369">And Master Li accepts Dawn Star&apos;s ability to see and sense things others can&apos;t. If he believes her, then how could I believe otherwise?</string>
  <string id="91644" soundid="141370">They&apos;re exactly what you&apos;d expect: the souls of humans who&apos;ve died. According to all the legends, when you die your soul travels to the underworld.</string>
  <string id="91645" soundid="141371">Once there, your soul is judged and placed upon the wheel of life so that it can return to this world in a new life.</string>
  <string id="91646" soundid="141372">A soul that doesn&apos;t return to the wheel of life becomes a ghost.</string>
  <string id="91647" soundid="141373">According to the stories, ghosts are usually people whose souls are trapped in this world either by circumstance or because they won&apos;t let go of their old lives.</string>
  <string id="91648" soundid="141374">The thing is, those circumstances are very rare, and you never heard about ghosts ten years ago. Now everyone&apos;s talking about them.</string>
  <string id="91649" soundid="141375">It&apos;s like something has happened, and people aren&apos;t leaving this world like they should be. Either that, or it&apos;s mass hysteria, but I can&apos;t believe that explanation.</string>
  <string id="91650" soundid="141376">We can always discuss this privately if you&apos;re curious, but I&apos;m interested in Lin&apos;s impressions.</string>
  <string id="91651" soundid="141377">From what I understand, Dawn Star is very sensitive to magic and to the spirits we call ghosts. She sees things that others can&apos;t.</string>
  <string id="91652" soundid="141378">Sometimes she knows things that she shouldn&apos;t. I really can&apos;t say if it is intuition or something else.</string>
  <string id="91653" soundid="141379">That was my first question when I started hearing these rumors. Apparently they can look just like us, though possibly pale and faded.</string>
  <string id="91654" soundid="141380">Some ghosts have been around a long time, and apparently they begin to change. They grow distant from their bodies and become more monsters than people.</string>
  <string id="91655" soundid="141381">The scary thing is that a lot of the stories I&apos;ve been hearing are about these old ghosts, the ones that look like monsters. It just doesn&apos;t make sense.</string>
  <string id="91657" soundid="141383">I suppose we all owe you our thanks, just like always.</string>
  <string id="91658">If you want Master Li to say it, don&apos;t give him a choice. Be the best you can.</string>
  <string id="91663">Don&apos;t worry about following others. Walk your own path.</string>
  <string id="91666">You lack the skills and the discipline to be a leader.</string>
  <string id="91667">You&apos;re right. I shouldn&apos;t underestimate your skills.</string>
  <string id="91669">You flatter yourself. Time does not excuse your clumsy strikes. </string>
  <string id="91671">Do you know anything about the cavern beneath the school?</string>
  <string id="91674">Do you know what this horrible thing is supposed to be?</string>
  <string id="91675">Where did you learn about the cavern?</string>
  <string id="91679">What exactly are these ghosts?</string>
  <string id="91682">Where do these ghosts come from?</string>
  <string id="91685">Tell me more about Dawn Star&apos;s sensitivity.</string>
  <string id="91688">What do ghosts look like?</string>
  <string id="91705" soundid="141441">Dawn Star wanted to be here when you left the cavern, but she&apos;s gone. If you ask me, something&apos;s wrong.</string>
  <string id="91706" soundid="141442">I don&apos;t know where she could have gone, but Wen or Lin might have some idea. You could ask in town as well.</string>
  <string id="91707" soundid="141443">Gao was a fool for challenging you. He&apos;s good, but you&apos;ve always been stronger. He just wouldn&apos;t admit it to himself.</string>
  <string id="91708" soundid="141444">Thing is, your &quot;prize&quot; is going into the cavern beneath the school. To hear Lin tell it, that place is going to challenge even you.</string>
  <string id="91709" soundid="141445">Next to nothing. I know Master Li forbids us to go in there until our final test, but that&apos;s about the only fact I have.</string>
  <string id="91710" soundid="141446">I hate repeating stories that aren&apos;t my own. Lin has no such qualms, so go ask her about the cavern.</string>
  <string id="91711" soundid="141447">Glad to see you&apos;re still well. By most reports, you faced down many of those bandits yourself. Impressive, senior student.</string>
  <string id="91712" soundid="141448">Who else? Gao the Lesser won&apos;t let a chance to glorify himself slip away.</string>
  <string id="91713" soundid="141449">That&apos;s the difference a lifetime of practice will make. I&apos;m sure their survivors learned a lesson.</string>
  <string id="91714" soundid="141450">Now you&apos;re sounding ever so slightly like Gao.</string>
  <string id="91715" soundid="141451">To hear Gao&apos;s side, he pushed back the bandits, but I know you dealt with the greater share of them.</string>
  <string id="91716" soundid="141452">Of course, it was best that our Master was there to deal with that sorcerer. The stories about their confrontation spread quicker than a plains fire.</string>
  <string id="91717" soundid="141453">Bandits coming here? They must not know about the school, or at least about Master Li. He&apos;s not a man to stand idly by while people suffer.</string>
  <string id="91718" soundid="141454">If they hurt Kia Min badly, Master Li will be angry. I&apos;d hate to be the captain of that ship if Master Li is angry.</string>
  <string id="91719" soundid="141455">Always good to see you wandering the school. You are the best among us after all, so it makes everyone train a little harder when you&apos;re around.</string>
  <string id="91720" soundid="141456">The tricky part is making sure we&apos;re emulating you, not hoping to take you down a peg. You should think carefully before bruising the tender egos around here.</string>
  <string id="91721" soundid="141457">Oh, and I did tell you to see Master Li when you have a chance? I&apos;m not taking the blame if you forget.</string>
  <string id="91722" soundid="141458">It&apos;s always good to see you again, but I should keep practicing. </string>
  <string id="91723" soundid="141459">They&apos;d probably skin me alive if they heard me say this, but Wen and Lin look like they&apos;ve got a little more free time right now.</string>
  <string id="91724" soundid="141460">Go pester them so they don&apos;t pester me.</string>
  <string id="91725" soundid="164299">(Sobbing)</string>
  <string id="91726" soundid="141462">I shall leave you to it. Take care, my friend.</string>
  <string id="91729">What do you know about the cavern?</string>
  <string id="91731">What does she say about it?</string>
  <string id="91732">Most reports? Who disagreed?</string>
  <string id="91734">They were unskilled and easily beat.</string>
  <string id="91736">I just wish Master Li had let me face their leader.</string>
  <string id="91744">I don&apos;t wish to spar with you right now.</string>
  <string id="91745" soundid="164121">We can find peace for a time at least, maybe until the voice of the shepherd returns so that we can find peace forever.</string>
  <string id="91747" soundid="141483">It means, however, that I must accelerate your training. These invaders discovered us by accident, but as you likely suspect, they are related to your destiny.</string>
  <string id="91748" soundid="141484">You have trained hard and are ready. You will have a pivotal role in some great events, my student... after you return from the Spirit Cave.</string>
  <string id="91749" soundid="141485">I object!</string>
  <string id="91750" soundid="141486">Gao? What is the meaning of this intrusion?</string>
  <string id="91751" soundid="141487">Your pet student is not the only one who fought those outlaws. Perhaps I did not stand in their midst on the beach like a fool, but I did my part!</string>
  <string id="91752" soundid="141488">If you spent less time coddling him, you would have many promising students instead of one.</string>
  <string id="91753" soundid="141489">This is not a matter that can be decided by effort, Gao. There are things at play that you do not understand.</string>
  <string id="91754" soundid="141490">I understand that this student has received preferential treatment and I have suffered for it. Whatever is in this Spirit Cave, I am worthy of facing it too!</string>
  <string id="91755" soundid="141491">If he is truly better than me, let him prove it. I challenge him.</string>
  <string id="91756" soundid="141492">If she is truly better than me, let her prove it. I challenge her.</string>

  <string id="91759" soundid="141495">Sometimes all you learn in defeat, is that you have been defeated. This world is out of balance. Spirits grow restless, and you have a role to play that I have kept secret.</string>

  <string id="91762" soundid="141498">What is this interruption? This had better be important... there is much to say.</string>
  <string id="91763" soundid="141499">Master! Ni Joh came to warn me! He saw a boat from the outlook past the fields! Strange outlaws. They fired... something at him, and Kia Min was injured!</string>
  <string id="91764" soundid="141500">Where is she now?</string>
  <string id="91765" soundid="141501">Still outside the village by the outlook. Ni Joh couldn&apos;t carry her. Please come, Master Li. The bandits are not at the village yet, but they could arrive at any time!</string>
  <string id="91766" soundid="141502">Hmm... we will have to continue our discussion later, my student. It appears we have more pressing matters.</string>
  <string id="91767" soundid="141503">The time for practice is over. Go to Gujin the weapon master and get a weapon. You may soon be called to use it.</string>
  <string id="91768" soundid="141504">You will have your chance to fight soon enough. Go to Gujin the weapon master; he has a weapon for you, and you will have need of it before long.</string>
  <string id="91769" soundid="141505">On your way, make certain Dawn Star is aware of the danger. Her skills have always complemented yours, so take her with you.</string>

  <string id="91794">I will fight them! Let me come with you!</string>
  <string id="91860" soundid="141640">I will not have you brawling in the street. If this must happen, it will happen in the ring, as a proper test of your abilities.</string>
  <string id="91861" soundid="141641">Gao, you are restricted to styles that I have taught. I know the dark tutoring your father, Gao the Greater, has imparted, but I won&apos;t have any such sorcery here.</string>
  <string id="91862" soundid="141642">Hobbled before I begin. Of course, how else will your precious protégé win?</string>
  <string id="91863" soundid="141643">My student, I do not trust Gao to fight honorably. Consider your attacks carefully. Prepare yourself and return when you are ready.</string>
  <string id="91864" soundid="141644">Remember the basics. They will serve you well.</string>
  <string id="91865" soundid="141645">Then let the fighters meet in the arena.</string>
  <string id="91866" soundid="141646">I will explain what I can after we have dealt with Gao&apos;s interruption. I don&apos;t want to confuse matters. Trust that I am right.</string>
  <string id="91867" soundid="141647">Return to me when you are ready to address this challenge by Gao.</string>
  <string id="91868" soundid="141648">Gao awaits your signal to start the challenge, my student. Tell me when you are ready and I will have the combat ring prepared.</string>
  <string id="91869" soundid="141649">Fighters, are you ready? This challenge will continue until one of you is incapacitated. This is not a practice bout... injury is a possibility.</string>
  <string id="91870" soundid="141650">A possibility? I think it is more than likely.</string>
  <string id="91871" soundid="155031">So simple, yes? Rat demon help you, now rat demon can go. Yes?</string>
  <string id="91876" soundid="141656">Master? Are you certain this is appropriate?</string>
  <string id="91877" soundid="141657">They have a dispute, and this is the only way to settle it with certainty. It will be an honorable contest. I have restricted Gao from using his father&apos;s sorcery.</string>
  <string id="91879" soundid="141659">I said you would regret getting in my way.</string>
  <string id="91880" soundid="141660">Fighters! Begin!</string>
  <string id="91882">If that is what you wish, I will accept.</string>
  <string id="91886">I will return when I am ready, Master.</string>
  <string id="91887">I am ready now. Let&apos;s begin.</string>

  <string id="92043" soundid="142440">We tried to fight them, and it worked to some degree, but these ghosts were howling mad. Some of them didn&apos;t even look human any more. Like monsters, they were.</string>

  <string id="92121" soundid="142663">You have the spirit shard? Very good, acolyte; you are on the verge of being welcomed into the heart of the fortress. Have you completed all other business?</string>
  <string id="92122" soundid="142664">Good. Grand Inquisitor Jia will be pleased, I am sure.</string>
  <string id="92123" soundid="142665">Do not test my patience, acolyte. I am not the fool Master Gang was.</string>
  <string id="92124">Master Gang and Master Shin have... resolved their differences poorly.</string>
  <string id="92126">I will bring it to you soon.</string>
  <string id="92127">I apologize on behalf of my Master. He is dead.</string>
  <string id="92130">Yes, proceed to the ritual.</string>
  <string id="92131">I will return shortly.</string>
  <string id="92161" soundid="142757">What? What do you want?</string>
  <string id="92162" soundid="142758">No, we&apos;ve got better things to do right now. Maybe I&apos;ll feel like talking after I&apos;ve bloodied up my axes a few more times.</string>
  <string id="92163" soundid="166938">Sheng finally did something right. It must be that young man in the robes who has been around.</string>
  <string id="92165" soundid="142761">Nuh.</string>
  <string id="92166">What did you do before you were with Lord Yun?</string>
  <string id="92167">What do you think about our current situation?</string>
  <string id="92168">Tell me something about your past.</string>
  <string id="92169" soundid="166939">I expect it was that large fellow with the shoulder pad. Thank heavens things are restored.</string>
  <string id="92170">That&apos;s all for now.</string>
  <string id="92175">Slave</string>
  <string id="92363">Be safe. Now go!</string>
  <string id="92364">You are nothing to me. Go.</string>
  <string id="92365">Run from here. Go.</string>
  <string id="92366" soundid="143123">Er, and my efforts to accelerate her training.</string>
  <string id="92367" soundid="143124">You are very fortunate to be welcomed so quickly into the heart of our order. Grand Inquisitor Jia will be pleased with you.</string>
  <string id="92378" soundid="143136"></string>
  <string id="92385" soundid="143146">What is the meaning of this! Who has corrupted this Jade Golem? It is linked to a legion of warriors that now run mad! The foundation will crumble!</string>
  <string id="92386" soundid="143147">Who are... you. Wait. I can... sense it on you. You are the one! You carry the other pieces of the amulet!</string>
  <string id="92387" soundid="143148">I... I&apos;m so sorry, Grand Inquisitor Jia. It is my new acolyte... there was some kind of mistake.</string>
  <string id="92388" soundid="143149">Fool! So blinded by petty schemes that you cannot see a threat in our midst! You are worthless!</string>
  <string id="92389" soundid="143150">And you... hidden in plain sight, like your master. You caught us unsuspecting, but not unprepared. Who are you, to think you could enter our lair so easily?</string>
  <string id="92390" soundid="143151">A simple student? I don&apos;t think so. An invader, conspirator, traitor. We survive by seeing the enemy in everyone.</string>
  <string id="92392" soundid="143153">Defeat us? No, we are well insulated against your kind. Whether an invader, a conspirator, a traitor, we survive by seeing the enemy in everyone.</string>
  <string id="92394" soundid="143155">My gravest apologies, Grand Inquisitor Jia. This new acolyte has corrupted the ritual.</string>
  <string id="92412">I am a simple student searching for his master.</string>
  <string id="92414">I am a simple student searching for her master.</string>
  <string id="92415">It doesn&apos;t matter what I am. I will defeat you.</string>
  <string id="92428" soundid="143189">There you are. Remember me? I &quot;welcomed&quot; you in the hall when you first arrived. Well, I said I wasn&apos;t through with you. I&apos;ve got numbers on my side, now.</string>
  <string id="92429" soundid="149476">Then leave me to deal with Gao and return when you are ready.</string>
  <string id="92498" soundid="143418">Everyone&apos;s heard about Gao the Lesser&apos;s little outburst. It figures he&apos;d try something like that when he was losing.</string>
  <string id="92501" soundid="143421">Unlike Gao, I want to learn my lessons properly. I would never disgrace myself the way he did.</string>
  <string id="92504" soundid="143424">Gao must have made his way through the gate. As I said, if he&apos;s headed for the swamp, he&apos;s a fool. There&apos;s nothing but bandits and beasts in that direction.</string>
  <string id="92508" soundid="143608">At my age, you don&apos;t dwell on dark subjects. There&apos;s not enough time to waste. Still....</string>
  <string id="92509" soundid="143609">For generations, masters have used that cave to test students. Not all of them possessed your master&apos;s wisdom, though, and some students were... lost.</string>
  <string id="92510" soundid="143610">Superstitious folk say that place is haunted, but I just think it&apos;s dangerous. I don&apos;t know the nature of that danger, so you be ready for anything.</string>
  <string id="92511">Tell me more about the cave under the school.</string>
  <string id="92514" soundid="143614">Master Li has asked that no students leave the school until the morning meditations are concluded.</string>
  <string id="92516" soundid="143617">No, of course not! It is just your way, and I would as soon ask you to change it as ask the leopard to shed its spots.</string>
  <string id="92653">Slaver Documents</string>
  <string id="92656" soundid="180317">I will show them the way, and they can join you. Not me, of course. I&apos;ll be there for you if you win, but I have to plan for any possible outcome.</string>
  <string id="92660" soundid="143872">Prosperous tidings. What can humble Hou do to assist you today?</string>
  <string id="92661" soundid="143873">Thank you again for rescuing me from those... things. I owe you my deepest gratitude. Is there some way I can be of assistance?</string>
  <string id="92665">Master Li</string>
  <string id="92668" soundid="143880">As you wish. I will be here waiting impatiently if you require anything.</string>
  <string id="92669" soundid="143881">As I mentioned, I am but a simple bun master, with a dear wife who has turned my life into a miserable cesspool devoid of humor and excitement. Bless her soul.</string>
  <string id="92670" soundid="143882">My wife ensures that I work very hard every day to become the best bun master in the Imperial City. Perhaps the best in all the Empire.</string>
  <string id="92671" soundid="143883">Though I was one of the most respected fighters in the Empire before I met my precious bride, she made sure that I became something more... or less.</string>
  <string id="92672" soundid="143884">As I mentioned before, my style requires that I drink. She detests drinking, though there are things she detests even more. Like talk of us... separating.</string>
  <string id="92673" soundid="143885">My loving wife would knead me into several small dumplings and boil me in hot oil if she suspected I was even speaking to you about leaving her.</string>
  <string id="92674" soundid="143886">Life is not all bad though. I may have lost all my dignity and self-respect, along with my ability to fight or even make a tight fist, but I am a bun master of some renown.</string>
  <string id="92675" soundid="143887">Oh yes. I&apos;m very proud of that. Indeed. Something very useful... buns that is. Everybody needs them. Oh yes, very proud.</string>
  <string id="92676" soundid="143888">I would sooner return to the cannibals and offer them what little flesh is left on my bones. Let&apos;s not discuss such things, if you don&apos;t mind.</string>
  <string id="92677" soundid="143889">I think we need to find that wind map and get out of here. Pardon my craven nature, but I&apos;m afraid it&apos;s all I have left after long years of... wedded bliss.</string>
  <string id="92678" soundid="143890">We have the wind map, so I think we should leave... immediately. I have many fine traits, but I&apos;m afraid my backbone has been crushed by years of... wedded bliss.</string>
  <string id="92681" soundid="143893">It would seem we have our work cut out for us. But as my darling wife likes to say, when things are tough... quit your whining and get to work.</string>
  <string id="92682" soundid="143894">I can almost hear her screaming at me now. If ever you find a cure for bad memories, please let me know.</string>
  <string id="92685" soundid="143897">I never realized that getting back to the Imperial City would be so... hazardous to my health. I was hoping the cannibals were the worst thing I would see.</string>
  <string id="92686" soundid="143898">I think we should keep moving. I have a bad feeling that if we stay in one place too long, we won&apos;t ever leave.</string>
  <string id="92687" soundid="143899">It would seem that we at last have the means necessary to get us back to the Imperial City, and for that I should be very glad.</string>
  <string id="92688" soundid="143900">However, I must now face the greatest trial of all; My sweet wife will no doubt be waiting for me. Soon my time with the cannibals with be nothing but a fond memory.</string>
  <string id="92690" soundid="143902">Perhaps in a little while. Memories of my wife are... difficult to bear. Especially when she is so very far away, and I may never see her again.</string>
  <string id="92691">Kill Zhong</string>
  <string id="92693">Tell me about your life before you were captured.</string>
  <string id="92696">You killed Zhong the Ox Carrier. Dong Ping will be ruined, but the ogre will no longer scare the patrons in the Teahouse.</string>
  <string id="92697" soundid="166591">The lessons you learn from me, or from any trainer for that matter, will stay with you, and help make you stronger, or better able to focus your mind or magic.</string>
  <string id="92698">That&apos;s all for now.</string>
  <string id="92700">That&apos;s too bad, Hou.</string>
  <string id="92701">Why doesn&apos;t she like you fighting?</string>
  <string id="92703">Just divorce her, and get it over with.</string>
  <string id="92705">Well, that&apos;s something to be proud of. I guess.</string>
  <string id="92706">When we get you home, I&apos;ll speak with your wife.</string>
  <string id="92707">I think it&apos;s time you told your wife what you think.</string>
  <string id="92708">What do you think about our current situation?</string>
  <string id="92714">Tell me more about yourself, Hou.</string>
  <string id="92715" soundid="166592">Let&apos;s see what you can learn.</string>
  <string id="92716" soundid="166593">Training has worth, and Master Li allows me to collect a small fee to reinforce this. Travel outside Two Rivers and you will find my prices are *quite* reasonable.</string>
  <string id="92717">A restless sleep before a battle has now become something worse. It seems that Master Li is manipulating your dreams, or that your dreams are manipulating you. Either way, the burning school you once called home is now the setting of a nightmarish battle.</string>
  <string id="92718" soundid="166595">No, I try to improve base abilities. But through the basics that Master Li has instilled, when you have the opportunity I&apos;m sure you will pick up new styles quickly.</string>
  <string id="92719">Spirit Font</string>
  <string id="92720" soundid="166597">Fair enough. I am patient as the rock facing the wind. What else was on your mind?</string>
  <string id="92722">Show me what you have.</string>
  <string id="92723" soundid="143935">I wish I&apos;d looked to see what he was dragging. He was heading toward the gate. The only place he could get to on foot is the swamp.</string>
  <string id="92725" soundid="143937">Of course not! I know there&apos;s more at stake! Someone will have to pay for the memorial, for flowers, and.... Er, yes, I see what you mean. Very sad.</string>
  <string id="92726" soundid="143938">Maybe you should ask Gujin. He always watches *me* like a hawk, why not others?</string>
  <string id="92727">Your only concern is that you&apos;ve lost a potential customer?</string>
  <string id="92730" soundid="143943">Your Master claims the throne and my power. He will rule as a god unless he is stopped.</string>
  <string id="92732" soundid="156390">And where are my Attendants? Delays and laziness will be repaid in blood! No one disobeys the orders of Shin!</string>
  <string id="92733">If he planned all of this, his lies have spanned years.</string>
  <string id="92809">Dawn Star&apos;s Garden</string>
  <string id="92810">Master Li&apos;s quarters</string>
  <string id="92811" soundid="144480"></string>
  <string id="92844" soundid="144058">Of course. I&apos;m sure you will find my company enjoyable.</string>
  <string id="92845" soundid="144059">A wise preference. No offense intended to your amusing companions.</string>
  <string id="92846" soundid="144060">Of course, I look forward to it.</string>
  <string id="92847">Travel with me now.</string>
  <string id="92848">Travel with me now. Dawn Star can go wait at the flyer.</string>
  <string id="92849">Travel with me now. Zu can go wait at the flyer.</string>
  <string id="92850">Travel with me now. Hou can go wait at the flyer.</string>
  <string id="92851">Travel with me now. The Black Whirlwind can go wait at the flyer.</string>
  <string id="92852">Travel with me now. Wild Flower can go wait at the flyer.</string>
  <string id="92853">Travel with me now. Sky can go wait at the flyer.</string>
  <string id="92854">Wait at the flyer. I will speak with you later.</string>
  <string id="92856" soundid="144070">I didn&apos;t think there would be so many! They&apos;re coming from the beach!</string>
  <string id="92857" soundid="144071">I know you&apos;ll stop them. You have to! They&apos;re coming from the beach!</string>
  <string id="92858" soundid="144072">The bandits are here! You have to stop them!</string>
  <string id="92859" soundid="144073">There are so many bandits all coming from the beach! I don&apos;t want to die!</string>
  <string id="92860">Ghost</string>
  <string id="92864">Lost Spirit</string>
  <string id="92868" soundid="144083">Where could he go, though? It must have been through town. There&apos;s nowhere to hide in the school.</string>
  <string id="92872" soundid="144089">There are more daunting problems to consider. For example, how will you sneak past Sheng&apos;s guards to make the switch?</string>
  <string id="92876" soundid="144096">The amulet, its pieces spread like petals to the wind. You have caught a few, but you are far from your peak, and not every golem was linked to this corrupted husk.</string>
  <string id="92877" soundid="144097">Goodbye, Spirit Monk. I will inform Death&apos;s Hand of your passing.</string>
  <string id="93101">There&apos;s no trade to be found in stability?</string>
  <string id="93103">Let&apos;s talk about what you can do for me.</string>
  <string id="93104">Gate</string>
  <string id="93105">Gate to the Golden Way</string>
  <string id="93106" soundid="156362">Is there something you need? If not, we should concentrate on getting the information I require from the Lotus Assassins.</string>
  <string id="93108">City Gate</string>
  <string id="93109" soundid="158475">Who&apos;s there? More of Gao&apos;s soldiers? I&apos;m through hiding. The marsh is outlaw territory!</string>
  <string id="93118" soundid="144376">It is not my job to rescue those who are not strong enough to protect themselves. That is an endless, foolish road.</string>
  <string id="93120" soundid="144389">Discomfort? If it was any smaller I&apos;d have to leave my axes behind. That, or start clearing some room. It can&apos;t need *all* of those shiny bits.</string>
  <string id="93121" soundid="144390">There&apos;s nothing mysterious about it. Our paths lead in the same direction. Anything else we discuss is between you and I. I&apos;ll thank you to keep it that way.</string>
  <string id="93122" soundid="144391">As you wish. I was merely curious. Just a little friendly talk between trusting friends. The group could use a little more of it.</string>
  <string id="93123" soundid="144392">I show interest in beautiful things. I meant no offense. I just want to learn more about my fellows.</string>
  <string id="93124" soundid="144393">I won&apos;t, but our cause will not wait for us. Thank you both for your concern.</string>
  <string id="93125" soundid="144394">Your resolve is absolute. I thought Dawn Star might be convinced to be more sensible.</string>
  <string id="93126" soundid="197676">I&apos;d go look for Dawn Star, but there might be ghosts out there.</string>
  <string id="93127" soundid="144396">Your station is already... low. Stepping down would serve no purpose, and I doubt you would find it easy to move up.</string>
  <string id="93128" soundid="144397">Oh, certainly. Those without titles regularly declare their unimportance.</string>
  <string id="93129" soundid="144398">I doubt the princess can. Those with titles tend to rely on them too much... and earn a few more along the way.</string>
  <string id="93130">This ends *NOW*!</string>
  <string id="93131">He&apos;s right, Dawn Star. Don&apos;t overdo it.</string>
  <string id="93132">That is true, Black Whirlwind.</string>
  <string id="93133">Why do you care about discomfort, Black Whirlwind? You&apos;re a warrior.</string>
  <string id="93134">Come now, Zu, why all the mystery?</string>
  <string id="93135">Let him be, Sky. We all have our secrets.</string>
  <string id="93136">You&apos;re showing a lot of interest in Dawn Star, Sky.</string>
  <string id="93137">We all need rest, but we can&apos;t stop now.</string>
  <string id="93139">Enough, Whirlwind. I apologize for his behavior, Princess.</string>
  <string id="93141">Not everyone places such value in titles, Princess. </string>
  <string id="93142">Arguing about roles is pointless. We need to move beyond this.</string>
  <string id="93186" soundid="144481"></string>
  <string id="93192">Let&apos;s hear the details surrounding Creative Yukong.</string>
  <string id="93197">Why is there a fee?</string>
  <string id="93198">I am a weapon of vengeance. I seek the head of Death&apos;s Hand!</string>
  <string id="93200">I am a Spirit Monk. I must stand against the Emperor!</string>
  <string id="93204">Save</string>
  <string id="93206">Gao&apos;s Mercenary in Spirit Cave</string>
  <string id="93211">You were challenged by a woman clad in black as you approached Tien&apos;s Landing. She apparently saw you leave Two Rivers, and assumed you were a minion of Death&apos;s Hand. You convinced her otherwise after surprising her with your martial skills.</string>
  <string id="93212" soundid="144517">I can&apos;t believe Two Rivers is gone. It was home... the people there were the only family I&apos;ve known. And now, they&apos;re all gone.</string>
  <string id="93213" soundid="144518">I understand, Dawn Star, but the path you are on may lead to even darker places. You must prepare yourself.</string>
  <string id="93214" soundid="144519">What do you want, Sky? You are watching me very closely, and not with the eyes of a friend.</string>
  <string id="93215" soundid="144520">Nothing, nothing. I just wanted to know what it felt like to work for Death&apos;s Hand. That&apos;s right, isn&apos;t it? You&apos;re one of them?</string>
  <string id="93216" soundid="144521">I was. Do you seek an apology for their actions, or am I just the latest target in your search for vengeance? I have to disappoint you. I will not accept either role.</string>
  <string id="93217" soundid="144522">I have not hidden that fact from you, or anyone else it was relevant to tell. Your true enemies will not reveal their nature to your face.</string>
  <string id="93218" soundid="144523">So you say, but he certainly wears the uniform.</string>
  <string id="93219" soundid="144524">Does any of this scare you, Wild Flower? You&apos;re so young, and our journey is... well, dangerous.</string>
  <string id="93220" soundid="144525">Why would I be scared? I have the Guardian to protect me. I&apos;m always safe with him, and he is always here.</string>
  <string id="93221" soundid="144526">I see. How exactly does he protect you? I use my blades and my wits to keep me safe. Are you sure this... Guardian can do the same for you?</string>
  <string id="93222" soundid="144527">Chai Ka: Very sure. Do you wish me to demonstrate?</string>
  <string id="93223" soundid="144528">No, no. That&apos;s quite all right. I... can see quite clearly how... you would be more than adequate protection. Nice demon.</string>
  <string id="93224" soundid="144529">Chai Ka: Rest assured, mortal, the girl is well protected against dangers without and within.</string>
  <string id="93225" soundid="144530">The equipment you carry with you, Kang... it seems quite expensive. Have a stash of silver somewhere, do you?</string>
  <string id="93226" soundid="144531">That&apos;s enough of that. I know a look of larceny when I see one. Besides, it will do you no good. With Gao gone I am... between benefactors.</string>
  <string id="93227">x</string>
  <string id="93228">x</string>
  <string id="93229">x</string>
  <string id="93230">x</string>
  <string id="93231">x</string>
  <string id="93232" soundid="144537">Hmm... the marks of the Lotus Assassins. You have covered some, Zu, but left others plain.</string>
  <string id="93233">x</string>
  <string id="93234">x</string>
  <string id="93237" soundid="144542">I don&apos;t want to think like that. We will set things right. We have to.</string>
  <string id="93238" soundid="144543">Returning your friends was never an option, but there are a great many more things that you can lose.</string>
  <string id="93239" soundid="144544">I... I know. I just wish there was a way to put things back the way they were.</string>
  <string id="93240" soundid="144545">In the past I have shared the company of others that... moved outside traditional paths, but this band of folks is by far the most... exotic.</string>
  <string id="93241" soundid="144546">You looked at me as you said that. What are you trying to say, Sky?</string>
  <string id="93242" soundid="144547">Actually, you took it the wrong way around. You seem a bit more conventional than, say, Wild Flower, or Zu.</string>
  <string id="93243" soundid="144548">The Guardian says that everyone hides a part of themselves, that they don&apos;t always look like what they really are.</string>
  <string id="93244" soundid="144549">I certainly hope that part&apos;s in there somewhere.</string>
  <string id="93245" soundid="144550">I can&apos;t help it.</string>
  <string id="93246" soundid="144551">Really, now?</string>
  <string id="93247" soundid="144552">Are we certain there is no room for us to stay in Tien&apos;s Landing? Do we really need to camp outside?</string>
  <string id="93248" soundid="144553">The ground is soft enough for a warrior. Walls just get in the way when the fighting starts. Besides, I&apos;ve yet to find a bed that fits me.</string>
  <string id="93249" soundid="144554">Not everyone has a hide as thick as yours.</string>
  <string id="93250">Sailor</string>
  <string id="93254" soundid="144559">That&apos;s good wine you&apos;ve got here, Hou! Not too sweet, not too sour... and it has a good kick to it.</string>
  <string id="93255" soundid="144560">I&apos;m pleased you like it, though I&apos;m afraid you like it a little bit too much. At this rate, we&apos;ll run out of wine before we get back to the Imperial City.</string>
  <string id="93256" soundid="144561">I hope you&apos;re joking, Hou! You don&apos;t want to see me when I&apos;m sober. You really don&apos;t.</string>
  <string id="93257" soundid="144562">I have an ointment you should try. Put it under your tongue, and it will stop your desire for alcohol. Well, more like &quot;replace.&quot;</string>
  <string id="93258" soundid="144563">More? Well, I suppose I hadn&apos;t thought about that. Let&apos;s see, distillation... crop variation... slide the three....</string>
  <string id="93259" soundid="144564">I don&apos;t usually offer a choice.</string>
  <string id="93260">On Agriculture</string>
  <string id="93266">That&apos;s a good idea, Chai Ka. Show him how you protect her.</string>
  <string id="93267">Enough, Chai Ka. Sky was just looking out for her.</string>
  <string id="93272">x</string>
  <string id="93273">x</string>
  <string id="93275">x</string>
  <string id="93278">She&apos;s right, Zu. More killing won&apos;t bring our friends back.</string>
  <string id="93279">I don&apos;t think we can. We may have to settle for vengeance.</string>
  <string id="93283">So we can assume Sky is hiding the part that doesn&apos;t ram its foot into its mouth?</string>
  <string id="93284">We all have hidden &quot;demons,&quot; but not literally. Your nature *is* odd.</string>
  <string id="93285">Yes, and Dawn Star does have strange abilities.</string>
  <string id="93288">The village is in rough shape. We must make do out here.</string>
  <string id="93291">Toughen up. If this is the worst we encounter, I&apos;ll be surprised.</string>
  <string id="93295">And how hard would it be to get more ointment to appease him?</string>
  <string id="93296">I like the Black Whirlwind as he is.</string>
  <string id="93297">
Food, and the shortage of it, has always been a primary concern within the Empire. With so many people crowded into cities, a lack of food in an urban area can result in deaths of thousands. While this is not itself a primary concern, the economic disruption and the outbreak of disease it usually causes are. Agriculture is, therefore, a critical industry of the Empire. Fertile areas can frequently have 2 or 3 crops a year, providing greatly for the cities. Due to the abject poverty in which these peasants live, they feel the need to grow as many crops as they can, as often as they can. This depletes the health of the soil, making future crops sickly and weak. I propose the institution of growing cycles, whereby a time is allowed for the land to renew itself. I have sent a copy of my proposal to the Imperial City, where I hope that it will gain the attention of the Minister of Agriculture.</string>
  <string id="93300">Can you blame him for his suspicion? You were one of them.</string>
  <string id="93301">You shouldn&apos;t have to. Zu is not an enemy, Sky.</string>
  <string id="93304">Enough about the bounties.</string>
  <string id="93305">I want to talk to you about a criminal named Aishi the Mournful Blade.</string>
  <string id="93307">What if I told you she is in the city?</string>
  <string id="93310">What crimes has she committed?</string>
  <string id="93312">If I brought you proof that she was dead, would I collect that bounty?</string>
  <string id="93314">All I want is to know about her.</string>
  <string id="93315">What can you tell me about the city?</string>
  <string id="93318">Could I ask you for more specifics about these areas?</string>
  <string id="93319">Do you have any information on that criminal hunted by the Assassins?</string>
  <string id="93321">It sounds to me as if the Assassins are worried.</string>
  <string id="93322">Sounds like you&apos;re angling for a quick promotion.</string>
  <string id="93323">Is there a bounty on this &quot;Scourge of the South?&quot;</string>
  <string id="93325">I wonder if we&apos;re being told the whole story. Could this criminal be justified in their actions?</string>
  <string id="93327">That&apos;s enough about the Scourge of the South.</string>
  <string id="93328">I should go.</string>
  <string id="93329">I certainly do. That&apos;s Yukong right over there.</string>
  <string id="93332">Why would you think that?</string>
  <string id="93334">I might be, for the right price.</string>
  <string id="93336">You assume I&apos;m a common mercenary?</string>
  <string id="93339">What criminals do you need help with?</string>
  <string id="93341">It sounds like these mercenaries have just forfeited their job to me.</string>
  <string id="93342">Sounds like you&apos;re out of luck. Goodbye.</string>
  <string id="93346">Before she died, she told me a most interesting story about you.</string>
  <string id="93352">For an opponent that dangerous, I expect a generous bounty.</string>
  <string id="93355" soundid="145807">I don&apos;t think we&apos;re alone. Something does not rest easy.</string>
  <string id="93358" soundid="145810">Do... do you feel that? Something is here. Something that hates the living!</string>
  <string id="93359">Jade Heart</string>
  <string id="93366">Why was nothing done to catch her earlier?</string>
  <string id="93368">Could I see the scene of the crime?</string>
  <string id="93370">What could she tell me?</string>
  <string id="93686" soundid="146236">The safe bet&apos;s on both of those being true. I don&apos;t think you&apos;ll have any trouble catching the attention of the Inquisitors.</string>
  <string id="93687" soundid="146237">It&apos;s clear that they don&apos;t know your real identity, and your skills are obvious</string>
  <string id="93688" soundid="146238">No... I&apos;m sure they have no idea of your real identity. I wouldn&apos;t worry about that.</string>
  <string id="93689" soundid="146239">I didn&apos;t mean to upset you. I was just making an observation. Let&apos;s go meet this Inquisitor.</string>
  <string id="93690" soundid="167914">We need to keep at our practices. Some of us don&apos;t believe in cheating during our matches; we want to win honestly.</string>
  <string id="93691" soundid="146241">Let&apos;s get back to the Dragonfly. If we hurry, we can have a couple drinks before this other guy shows up.</string>
  <string id="93692" soundid="146242">Well, we got what we wanted. I just hope you know what you&apos;re getting into. We should head back to the Dragonfly and let the others know what&apos;s happening.</string>
  <string id="93693" soundid="146243">You got the chance you wanted. No sense wasting it by showing up late. Let&apos;s head back to the Dragonfly.</string>
  <string id="93694" soundid="146244">We should get back to the Dragonfly. If we&apos;re late, the Inquisitor might get angry, and then he might not help us at all.</string>
  <string id="93695" soundid="146245">Well, you&apos;ve got what you wanted. I don&apos;t approve of this course, but if you want to deal with the Inquisitors you better not be late for this meeting. Let&apos;s go.</string>
  <string id="93697" soundid="146247">Nobody here suspects me to be anything but an overzealous scholar, and I&apos;d like to keep it that way. So, you want to know about the recruiter?</string>
  <string id="93698" soundid="146248">You have a flying machine, do you not? Yes, I know about that. Go back to the landing area and someone will meet you there.</string>
  <string id="93699" soundid="146249">The location is public, yet relatively private. Common folk are not welcome on the landing area, so there will be no crowds to hide spies... or an ambush.</string>
  <string id="93700" soundid="146250">If the Lotus Assassins wanted you dead, your life would be over before you even knew you were in danger. </string>
  <string id="93701" soundid="146251">I don&apos;t think so. I&apos;ve already told you what you need to know. I&apos;m not about to risk being discovered just to make you feel at ease.</string>
  <string id="93702" soundid="146252">He already knows, I&apos;m sure. Now go, I will not speak to you about this any further.</string>
  <string id="93703" soundid="146253">They already know about you. That means one of two things. Either the Princess is exceptionally good at spreading rumors, or they&apos;re desperate for new people.</string>
  <string id="93706">Why should we meet there?</string>
  <string id="93707">How do I know this isn&apos;t a trap?</string>
  <string id="93708">I want to ask you some questions.</string>
  <string id="93710">Tell the Inquisitor recruiter I&apos;ll be there.</string>
  <string id="93713">What makes you so sure?</string>
  <string id="93715">I just hope I don&apos;t draw too much attention.</string>
  <string id="93717">If I wanted your opinion about this out here in the open, I&apos;d have asked.</string>
  <string id="93719" soundid="167915">After hearing about the way you dealt with those bandits, we wanted to make sure we were ready if they ever came again.</string>
  <string id="93725">Captain Sen</string>
  <string id="93743">Bandit Camp</string>
  <string id="93750" soundid="152351">You&apos;re going to rescue Master Li. I know you&apos;ll find a way, but still....</string>
  <string id="93753" soundid="146358">[Success] True. You are more reasonable than I would have suspected from my first impression.</string>
  <string id="93754" soundid="146359">[Success] That I could tell instantly. You carry yourself with confidence born of skill. Perhaps a talk would be good before our confrontation.</string>
  <string id="93755" soundid="146360">[Success] Hmm. That it is, and who am I to be selective about who hears my tale?</string>
  <string id="93756" soundid="146361">Do you know anything of me? Anything of the terror that is Aishi the Mournful Blade?</string>
  <string id="93757" soundid="146362">[Failure] You are meant to face me, not to listen to me. Listening is not in your nature, and so I will not force my history on you.</string>
  <string id="93758" soundid="146363">Let us see who proves the stronger.</string>
  <string id="93759" soundid="146364">You should.</string>
  <string id="93760" soundid="146365">&quot;If we help him, he&apos;ll only tell the others what we&apos;ve done. We have to let him go.&quot; Simple words, but they still echo in my head, even now.</string>
  <string id="93761" soundid="146366">Nights are worse. I can&apos;t sleep for the screams of that boy as he washed away; I still hear them to this day.</string>
  <string id="93762">An old man told me you had a story to tell.</string>
  <string id="93764">I can&apos;t walk away from a potential bounty.</string>
  <string id="93766">You don&apos;t know what you&apos;re dealing with if you think you can threaten me.</string>
  <string id="93768">That&apos;s a risk I&apos;m willing to take.</string>
  <string id="93776">Let&apos;s hear this tale of yours.</string>
  <string id="93777">I&apos;m not here to talk to a murderer.</string>
  <string id="93779">I would like to hear your tale.</string>
  <string id="93780">[Charm] How many would have let you talk this long?</string>
  <string id="93782">[Intimidation] If you know me as well as you claim to, you know our fight will not be easy.</string>
  <string id="93784">[Intuition] I think this is a story you want to be heard.</string>
  <string id="93787">If you&apos;re done analyzing me, I have a bounty to collect.</string>
  <string id="93788">I should just leave you alone.</string>
  <string id="93790">I don&apos;t know if it was really your fault.</string>
  <string id="93795">Dock</string>
  <string id="93796">Ru&apos;s Barge</string>
  <string id="93797">Captain Sen was the young man you were in love with?</string>
  <string id="93799">He is a powerful man. How do you plan to attack him?</string>
  <string id="93802">Why do you care about this? Aren&apos;t you a heartless criminal?</string>
  <string id="93804">If what you say is true, Sen deserves what&apos;s coming to him.</string>
  <string id="93805">I&apos;m going to take you to Sen. We&apos;ll see how he reacts.</string>
  <string id="93807">Touching story. Really, it was. Sadly, it&apos;s also over. Time to die.</string>
  <string id="93810">Just walk away. You deserve your peace.</string>
  <string id="93812">I&apos;m ready when you are.</string>
  <string id="93814">I wasn&apos;t going to let you go without my bounty.</string>
  <string id="93816" soundid="146423">There is another in this city with a price on her head. A richer price than those two.</string>
  <string id="93817" soundid="146424">Her name is Aishi the Mournful Blade, and you can find her at the Black Leopard School.</string>
  <string id="93818" soundid="146425">I watched her walk into this city, and now I tell you. There&apos;s no mystery in this.</string>
  <string id="93819" soundid="146426">She is accused of most crimes, and several had to be invented to account for her actions. She is a terror upon the face of the Empire.</string>
  <string id="93820" soundid="146427">Murder, theft, and worse, yet never a smile or a hint of revelry in what she did. That is why she is known as Aishi the Mournful Blade.</string>
  <string id="93821" soundid="146428">It is across the river and at the far end of the Market District. A grassy path leads up, away from the noise of the city.</string>
  <string id="93822" soundid="146429">Atop the hill lies the Black Leopard School, and within, Aishi. She is waiting for someone to come find her, I think.</string>
  <string id="93823" soundid="146430">Because I want you to know. My role in this matter is of no concern to you. I am simply an old man who sees a chance for some good to come from bad.</string>
  <string id="93824" soundid="146431">I&apos;ve heard of this Aishi. She&apos;s reputed to be deadly and merciless, yet cloaked with deep sadness.</string>
  <string id="93825" soundid="146432">This Aishi sounds like my kind of woman!</string>
  <string id="93826" soundid="146433">We shouldn&apos;t let a criminal run free. Something tells me that there&apos;s more to this story than this man&apos;s telling us, though.</string>
  <string id="93827" soundid="146434">When you reach her, you should ask her for her story. She has a most interesting tale to share.</string>
  <string id="93828" soundid="146435">I hoped it would end this way. She may have found some peace.</string>
  <string id="93829" soundid="146436">Here, take this. It&apos;s something Aishi would have wanted you to have, I think. I hate for a good deed to go unrewarded.</string>
  <string id="93830" soundid="146437">Ha! There&apos;s little reward in a good deed, and just the opposite for those who walk the low path. I know that better than most.</string>
  <string id="93831" soundid="146438">Aishi the Mournful Blade was my daughter.</string>
  <string id="93832" soundid="146439">My daughter&apos;s life was nothing but pain. Her crimes were a way to forget, for a while.</string>
  <string id="93833" soundid="146440">Wait, he&apos;s... he&apos;s dead! He&apos;s a ghost, but his will is so strong I couldn&apos;t tell until just now!</string>
  <string id="93834" soundid="146441">I think she must have found some peace now, and I can finally rest. It has been too long since I turned away from the Water Dragon&apos;s embrace.</string>
  <string id="93835" soundid="146442">You couldn&apos;t tell? A Spirit Monk? Ahh, but you are not fully trained, and I have refused to let any part of myself slip away.</string>
  <string id="93836" soundid="146443">Some things are stronger than anger, Spirit Monk. Love is one of them.</string>
  <string id="93837" soundid="146444">I know that, Spirit Monk, but I am a patient man, and I refuse to let myself slip away.</string>
  <string id="93838" soundid="146445">I have some idea of what you face. Take my best wishes as you try to set things right.</string>
  <string id="93839" soundid="146446">I have waited more than two decades. I can wait a bit more, and now... now I have a reason to smile.</string>
  <string id="93843">How do you know where a criminal can be found?</string>
  <string id="93844">What is this Aishi accused of?</string>
  <string id="93846">Where is the Black Leopard School?</string>
  <string id="93848">Why are you telling me this?</string>
  <string id="93849">Thank you for the information. You can go.</string>
  <string id="93854">Good deeds are their own reward.</string>
  <string id="93856">Thank you, but why?</string>
  <string id="93857">Who are you?</string>
  <string id="93858">Why did you tell me she was in the Imperial City?</string>
  <string id="93859">You turned her in. Some father.</string>
  <string id="93862">Turned away... wait, you&apos;re dead?</string>
  <string id="93864">If you&apos;re a ghost, why haven&apos;t you gone mad?</string>
  <string id="93865">How do you know about my heritage?</string>
  <string id="93866">What will you do next?</string>
  <string id="93869" soundid="146476">Don&apos;t you just love the Imperial Arena? No other place like it in all of the Jade Empire.</string>
  <string id="93870" soundid="146477">Hold on, you&apos;re Raging Dragon, aren&apos;t you? I&apos;ve heard all about you. It&apos;s a pleasure. I&apos;m Lady Rento.</string>
  <string id="93871" soundid="146478">Wait a moment! You&apos;re Silver Phoenix! How very nice to meet you. I&apos;m Lady Rento.</string>
  <string id="93872" soundid="146479">If it isn&apos;t Tiger Lifts the Mountain. How exciting to meet you! I am Lady Rento.</string>
  <string id="93873" soundid="146480">Were you looking for me? I&apos;m Lady Rento, and I was expecting someone sent by Captain Sen.</string>
  <string id="93874" soundid="146481">Hello again. What can I do for you?</string>
  <string id="93875" soundid="146482">Oh, poor Yukong. Captain Sen&apos;s still willing to do my husband&apos;s bidding and hunt him down, is he?</string>
  <string id="93876" soundid="146483">I swear, my husband is insufferable. Yukong&apos;s a harmless aspiring actor who asked me if I would act as his patron.</string>
  <string id="93877" soundid="146484">Since my husband was away from the city... again... I accepted and gave Yukong a moderate stipend. I thought he was charming.</string>
  <string id="93878" soundid="146485">That was how my husband presented the situation to the authorities. He didn&apos;t want to face the &quot;shame&quot; of supporting a humble actor.</string>
  <string id="93879" soundid="146486">My husband&apos;s a fool, but when he lowers his head, all I can do is let him charge and hope he rams something solid enough to slow him.</string>
  <string id="93880" soundid="146487">Probably less than my husband is putting forth as a bounty for poor Yukong. That young man doesn&apos;t deserve this.</string>
  <string id="93881" soundid="146488">I would wager that you&apos;ll find him in the Scholars&apos; Garden. Yukong was going to try out for that new play.</string>
  <string id="93882" soundid="146489">I&apos;m sure you heard about it when it was performed in the Golden Way. Made quite the impression, I&apos;m told.</string>
  <string id="93883" soundid="146490">It&apos;s going to be put on soon in the Golden Way, I&apos;m told. Should be exciting to watch.</string>
  <string id="93884" soundid="146491">Yukong was going to try out for a role as a scholar, so he may be using his costume to hide in the garden. He&apos;s not much of a scholar, so you should be able to spot him.</string>
  <string id="93885" soundid="146492">Oh, normally I would be happy to chat, but now really isn&apos;t the time.</string>
  <string id="93886" soundid="146493">I&apos;ve had a trying day and I just want to relax in the Heart of the Empire for a few minutes before I rush home to attend the family accounts.</string>
  <string id="93887" soundid="146494">My husband claims he has no head for figures, though I suspect he just has no back for work.</string>
  <string id="93888" soundid="146495">If you happen to find Creative Yukong, do go easy on him, would you?</string>
  <string id="93889" soundid="146496">The poor boy did nothing wrong, and my husband is being unusually cruel to him.</string>
  <string id="93890" soundid="146497">Thank you. I have so little time to take in the ambiance of this place.</string>
  <string id="93892">I&apos;m here to talk to you about Creative Yukong.</string>
  <string id="93895">Why is Yukong wanted for confidence schemes?</string>
  <string id="93897">How much did you give this actor?</string>
  <string id="93898">Do you have any idea where I could find Creative Yukong?</string>
  <string id="93902">Would you mind if I asked you a few questions?</string>
  <string id="93905">I should let you get back to what you were doing.</string>
  <string id="93907" soundid="150714">Chai Ka: You have drawn some attention, but their description lacks accuracy. What they have will not reveal you.</string>
  <string id="93908">Too much a fool to accept your fate.</string>
  <string id="93913" soundid="146520">Dancing pretty lights. There&apos;s fire in the air and fire inside. They scream like music.</string>
  <string id="93914" soundid="146521">You&apos;ll scream like a demon when Fading Moon puts the light inside of you.</string>
  <string id="93915" soundid="146522">There&apos;s more than that on my head. There&apos;s a crown of flame that burns all the time, even when it gets tighter!</string>
  <string id="93916" soundid="146523">None of us are alive anymore, not until the lights dance with us!</string>
  <string id="93917" soundid="146524">You don&apos;t get to leave. We have to dance like the pretty lights.</string>
  <string id="93918" soundid="146525">You&apos;ll scream like those maggot people, leeching off the Empire until they burn!</string>
  <string id="93919" soundid="146526">Dancing lights.</string>
  <string id="93920" soundid="146527">Leaping flames inside us all. Purity.</string>
  <string id="93921" soundid="146528">Climbing higher &apos;til all fall down!</string>
  <string id="93922" soundid="146529">Red to black to gray.</string>
  <string id="93924">You&apos;re Fading Moon? There&apos;s a bounty on your head.</string>
  <string id="93926">It&apos;s always harder when they&apos;re insane, I&apos;ll wager.</string>
  <string id="93928">Maybe I&apos;ll leave you to your &quot;lights.&quot;</string>
  <string id="94226">I can&apos;t hurt you?</string>
  <string id="94263">You were ordered to kill innocents? Why even consider it?</string>
  <string id="94264" soundid="146886">I have my reasons. For now I&apos;ll tell you this... it&apos;s a part of my life I wish I could forget. But no matter how much I drink, it stays with me.</string>
  <string id="94267" soundid="146889">Just keep clear of this place... that&apos;s what I wanted to tell you. It&apos;s rotten to the core... or at the top... or maybe at the core of the top. You know what I mean.</string>
  <string id="94268" soundid="146890">You don&apos;t need anything else from this place, so just stop here. You don&apos;t want to go any further... let&apos;s just leave it at that.</string>
  <string id="94269" soundid="146891">What? What do you want?</string>
  <string id="94270" soundid="146892">Tried that once, it didn&apos;t work out. Prefect Mu Hong pledged his daughter Meishan to me, after I cleared his district of bandits. She wasn&apos;t ugly, so I agreed.</string>
  <string id="94271" soundid="146893">The night of the wedding feast, I got more than a little drunk, and in the morning I woke up in the prefect&apos;s bed, next to the prefect&apos;s wife.</string>
  <string id="94272" soundid="146894">I got up and went to my bride&apos;s room, and there was strange man in her bed. I killed the bastard and was about to kill her when Meishan came into the room yelling!</string>
  <string id="94273" soundid="146895">Apparently, I had just killed her sister&apos;s husband and was about to kill her sister. I tried to tell her it was an honest mistake, but she wouldn&apos;t hear it.</string>
  <string id="94274" soundid="146896">The brother-in-law&apos;s family was pissed, and so was the prefect when he found out about his wife. They tried to subdue me, so they could send me to prison.</string>
  <string id="94275" soundid="146897">I killed them all swiftly. None of them suffered. Still, Meishan wouldn&apos;t leave with me; she kept crying and complaining about her family. Family life just isn&apos;t for me.</string>
  <string id="94276" soundid="146898">Whatever.</string>
  <string id="94277">Lost Spirit</string>
  <string id="94278" soundid="146900">I&apos;m a fighter, not a damn history book! No more stories. You&apos;ve got my fists and my axes, that&apos;s enough. Let&apos;s find someone to kill!</string>
  <string id="94279" soundid="146901">Not now, I&apos;m done talking about myself. Let&apos;s go do something fun... like kill someone.</string>
  <string id="94280" soundid="146902">Too much talking and thinking can be dangerous. I should know. I remember one cold winter I took a job clearing rats from a local monastery.</string>
  <string id="94281" soundid="146903">I was supposed to make sure the pests stayed out of the sacred pools, but hunting rats one at a time is boring work. So I had an idea, a way to catch &apos;em all at once.</string>
  <string id="94282" soundid="146904">I convinced the monks to give me some of their sacred wine, and I filled the sacred pools. I figured if I could get the rats drunk they&apos;d be so much easier to catch.</string>
  <string id="94283" soundid="146905">Nothing happened at first, so I helped myself to the wine. I passed out before the rats came. In the middle of the night I was woken up by screaming monks and fiery explosions.</string>
  <string id="94284" soundid="146906">It was just the rats. The poor furry buggers were just trying to get warm near the monk&apos;s fires after their swim in the wine! Not a good combination!</string>
  <string id="94285" soundid="146907">The monks wanted me gone. I might have deserved the blame, but the abbot insisted it was a sign from the gods and closed the monastery. See what happens when you think too much?</string>
  <string id="94286">The strong must rule, but simple murder is a waste.</string>
  <string id="94287" soundid="166940">It must be that young woman in blue. I saw her and thought, &quot;If anyone can help us, it&apos;s her.&quot;</string>
  <string id="94288" soundid="166941">The young woman in red, right? We should thank the heavens she came to our town, then.</string>
  <string id="94289" soundid="166942">It must be that woman in plum I&apos;ve seen around town! Well, thank the Emperor she arrived!</string>
  <string id="94292" soundid="166945">They say the dam will never close.</string>
  <string id="94293" soundid="146915">I always figured if I saw the Emperor it would be for my own execution. &apos;Course, the day&apos;s still young.</string>
  <string id="94294" soundid="146916">I just hope I get to meet the man who taught you how to fight. I&apos;ve never seen someone so small fight so well. First, we have to free him.</string>
  <string id="94295" soundid="146917">Let&apos;s get to the palace and give the Emperor a taste of real power! We&apos;ll have your master free in no time.</string>
  <string id="94296" soundid="146918">Well, the city has everything you could ever want. Fighting, money, wine, and... hmm... there was something else that people like, but I can&apos;t quite remember what it is.</string>
  <string id="94297" soundid="146919">Oh well, I&apos;m sure it&apos;ll come to me once I&apos;ve had a few bowls of wine. Let&apos;s get something to wet our tongues!</string>
  <string id="94298" soundid="146920">This is going to be fun. Those Lotus Assassins won&apos;t know what hit &apos;em. This might just be the most exciting day of my life.</string>
  <string id="94299" soundid="146921">You know, battles like this don&apos;t come along every day. We could very well die in there, cut up into small pieces, trying to fight off hundreds of enemies.</string>
  <string id="94300" soundid="146922">I&apos;m getting goose bumps just thinking about it. C&apos;mon... let&apos;s go to the fortress and have some fun.</string>
  <string id="94301" soundid="146923">These Lotus Assassins really aren&apos;t all that tough; they&apos;re just trained well. I&apos;ve seen men a lot tougher than this run scared from a fight, but not these guys.</string>
  <string id="94302" soundid="146924">They&apos;re like well-trained dogs, and just as dangerous... though they smell slightly better, and I&apos;m willing to bet they wouldn&apos;t taste as good over a plate of rice. </string>
  <string id="94303" soundid="146925">Damn it, now I&apos;m getting hungry... and thirsty. Let&apos;s get this finished so I can get something to drink.</string>
  <string id="94304" soundid="146926">I can&apos;t believe Silk Fox is the princess! Who&apos;d have thought a spoiled little emperor&apos;s daughter could fight like that? Her dad certainly brought her up right.</string>
  <string id="94305" soundid="146927">That&apos;s one way to make sure your little angel doesn&apos;t get despoiled by anyone... teach her how to kick a man&apos;s ass into his throat!</string>
  <string id="94306" soundid="146928">Speaking of kicking, you&apos;d better keep going if you&apos;re ever going to pass as a Lotus Assassin.</string>
  <string id="94307" soundid="146929">Nothing&apos;s changed since the last time you asked me. Unless I passed out... did I pass out? No... how could I? I haven&apos;t been drinking!</string>
  <string id="94308" soundid="156043">Some things are best kept a secret, and I tried to warn you. This is the last time, I promise.</string>
  <string id="94309" soundid="156044">My brother became the arena champion... the Raging Ox. They said he retired, but he didn&apos;t retire... he was killed. I should know; I&apos;m the one who killed him.</string>
  <string id="94310" soundid="156045">I&apos;ve killed hundreds, thousands of men. Death has no hold over me... even my brother&apos;s death.</string>
  <string id="94311" soundid="156046">I wanted nothing from this place. He would have kept his title if it wasn&apos;t for Kai Lan.</string>
  <string id="94312" soundid="156047">Raging Ox was one of Kai Lan&apos;s men... well, he wasn&apos;t always. Kai Lan approached me first, and when I turned him down, he went to my brother instead.</string>
  <string id="94313" soundid="156048">I&apos;m sure you know all about that, what with the Khana thing and all. I knew what was happening as soon as I saw her sway, but that&apos;s another secret I&apos;m keeping.</string>
  <string id="94314" soundid="156049">When Ox joined up with Kai Lan, I stopped getting good matches. Ox was fighting his way to becoming champion, and doing a little work for the Guild on the side.</string>
  <string id="94315" soundid="156050">He was so cocksure and wouldn&apos;t listen to his older brother. Once he fell in with Kai Lan, he stopped talking to me.</string>
  <string id="94316" soundid="156051">Soon, Ox became Kai Lan&apos;s enforcer and carried out his bidding. He&apos;d skulk around in robes so no one would know the arena champion was a common thug.</string>
  <string id="94317" soundid="156052">One night, I followed Ox back to Kai Lan&apos;s. I was drunk, and I was mad. I just wanted to tell Ox how dangerous Kai Lan was... convince him to leave.</string>
  <string id="94318" soundid="156053">But Kai Lan was there, he tried to interfere. I attacked him, and Ox tried to stop me. When it was over... Ox was dead, and my axe was covered in his blood.</string>
  <string id="94319" soundid="156054">I didn&apos;t do it on purpose. It was stupid... but it was an accident.</string>
  <string id="94320" soundid="156055">Kai Lan just stood there, smiling. I would have killed him if I wasn&apos;t so stunned.</string>
  <string id="94321" soundid="156056">After that, I left. For the first time in my life, I ran. I ran, and then I drank myself into a stupor that lasted for half a year.</string>
  <string id="94322" soundid="156057">Sometimes these things have to come out, or they&apos;ll kill you. Still, don&apos;t try to give me a hug, or I&apos;ll lop your head off.</string>
  <string id="94323" soundid="156058">You do what you have to in the arena. Just don&apos;t fool yourself about working with the Serpent.</string>
  <string id="94324" soundid="156059">Good idea. We&apos;ll leave Kai Lan to explain how Cho&apos;s body ended up in his room.</string>
  <string id="94325" soundid="156060">Lucky Cho&apos;s death just put you on the Serpent&apos;s wanted list. I&apos;d really like to see Kai Lan&apos;s face if you become arena champion. &apos;Course, I&apos;d rather just kill him.</string>
  <string id="94326">Innocents die. That is what they do. So what?</string>
  <string id="94327" soundid="156061">C&apos;mon. Let&apos;s go.</string>
  <string id="94328">Are you all right?</string>
  <string id="94332">Again you tease with secrets. Out with it!</string>
  <string id="94333">You claim knowledge but share nothing. I have no further interest in you.</string>
  <string id="94335">Kai Lan truly is a serpent.</string>
  <string id="94337">Enlighten me.</string>
  <string id="94338" soundid="146960"></string>
  <string id="94339" soundid="146961">I thought there&apos;d be more half-dressed serving girls with bowls of wine and food. What kind of Emperor doesn&apos;t have serving girls?</string>
  <string id="94340" soundid="146962">Let&apos;s get going. Maybe he keeps the good stuff farther in.</string>
  <string id="94341" soundid="146963"></string>
  <string id="94342" soundid="146964">Now what is it?</string>
  <string id="94343" soundid="146965">I&apos;ve already told you all I can. Besides, this is the time for battle, not words!</string>
  <string id="94344" soundid="146966">What? This isn&apos;t the time for stories... it&apos;s time to fight. Let&apos;s sharpen our blades instead of our tongues!</string>
  <string id="94345" soundid="146967">I never thought I&apos;d see the day when somebody would actually defy a god... and live. You&apos;ve got some spirit... and soon you&apos;ll have her spirit, too.</string>
  <string id="94346" soundid="146968">C&apos;mon, there&apos;s nothing stopping us now. Let&apos;s find that old bastard Li and give him a taste of his own medicine!</string>
  <string id="94347" soundid="146969">I&apos;m not sure what happened back there with the dragon, but one thing&apos;s for sure... Li&apos;s in for the fight of his life!</string>
  <string id="94348" soundid="146970">Never thought we&apos;d be back here again, and still no serving girls! These Sun brothers are a strange lot. C&apos;mon, let&apos;s find this dragon and be done with it.</string>
  <string id="94349" soundid="146971">Good. I&apos;m itching to fight, not talk.</string>
  <string id="94350" soundid="146972">The boredom is always greatest before the storm. Could we poke a stick in the eye of this little squall and get moving?</string>
  <string id="94351" soundid="146973">Good decisions win the battle, bad decisions draw it out. Either way, I&apos;ll be on the field.</string>
  <string id="94352" soundid="146974">Besides, this Death&apos;s Hand fellow seems fine to me. Hasn&apos;t touched my wine, and he fights well enough.</string>
  <string id="94353" soundid="146975">As for the others, just means more fighting for me. Everything worked out fine, if you ask me.</string>
  <string id="94354" soundid="146976">As for this binding crap, I don&apos;t see how it changes anything. A body is a body in battle. If it can fight for you, who cares what it is?</string>
  <string id="94355" soundid="146977">I always have my fists, so I&apos;m always ready. If I lose those, I&apos;ll have bigger problems than missing a fight.</string>
  <string id="94356" soundid="146978">Actually, better safe than sorry. Kang! Make me a wine bowl I can hold with stumps!</string>
  <string id="94357" soundid="146979">Yours or someone else&apos;s?</string>
  <string id="94358" soundid="146980">Ha! Now that&apos;s the kind of idea I can get behind!</string>
  <string id="94359" soundid="146981">Don&apos;t waste your anger on me, save it for the enemy! Now or later, I don&apos;t really care, as long as I get to spill some blood!</string>
  <string id="94361" soundid="146983">How about sooner?</string>
  <string id="94363" soundid="146985">I&apos;m pretty sure I thought you were a ghost. That, and you looked like you might be able to hold your own for a few moments.</string>
  <string id="94364" soundid="146986">Turns out I sold you short... easy to do when you&apos;re as tall as I am.</string>
  <string id="94365" soundid="146987">Drunken cows are no joke! I had to wrangle a whole herd of &apos;em once. Bloody things broke into a winery and drank &apos;til their milk was curdled.</string>
  <string id="94366" soundid="146988">I finally rounded &apos;em up, but the farmer said the milkings were unbearable for a week after that. Milk and wine... that&apos;s bad mix.</string>
  <string id="94367" soundid="146989">Where?</string>
  <string id="94368" soundid="146990">Oh, you mean me? That&apos;s water under the bridge, through the lake, and out to the ocean.</string>
  <string id="94369" soundid="146991">Anyway, I&apos;m guessing you must be here on Lord Yun&apos;s business. Can&apos;t imagine why anyone would come here otherwise.</string>
  <string id="94370" soundid="146992">Look, I&apos;m no good with forests, trees, or temples. If you want to talk about that stuff, Spear&apos;s your man.</string>
  <string id="94371" soundid="146993">You know how it goes.</string>
  <string id="94372" soundid="146994">You wander the countryside, maybe set fire to a few fields, pass out behind a barn, get chased by farm dogs... before you know it you&apos;re here... talking with you.</string>
  <string id="94373">I will find a way to enter without participating in their foul ways.</string>
  <string id="94374" soundid="146996">It gets me the ladies.</string>
  <string id="94375" soundid="146997">Ha! Of course not. Just look at me! A lady&apos;s got to be damn drunk before she&apos;d be impressed by my name.</string>
  <string id="94376" soundid="146998">Ha, ha! You got that right! Damn if I&apos;m not starting to like you. No, it takes more than a name to impress the ladies, that&apos;s for sure.</string>
  <string id="94377" soundid="146999">Well... there was that time during the Fall of the Nine Fathers when I would crash down on a town like a black storm of death, rending flesh from bone.</string>
  <string id="94378" soundid="147000">I was a force of destruction. The streets ran red with blood and everyone I approached screamed, &quot;The Black Whirlwind is here!&quot;</string>
  <string id="94379" soundid="147001">It might have been that... or maybe I thought it up when I was drunk. Either way, it stuck.</string>
  <string id="94380" soundid="147002">Way ahead of you. What were we talking about?</string>
  <string id="94381" soundid="147003">Ha! I attack just about everyone I meet. We just got it out of the way early.</string>
  <string id="94382" soundid="147004">Now we&apos;ll get along just fine. I don&apos;t suppose you have any wine on you?</string>
  <string id="94383" soundid="147005">Good, I&apos;m going to see if I can find some hidden stocks of sacramental wine. Tastes terrible, but it does the trick.</string>
  <string id="94386">Why did you attack me?</string>
  <string id="94389">Ha! Your strikes are clumsy as a drunken cow.</string>
  <string id="94392">If you&apos;re done talking, I have a gigantic oaf to kill.</string>
  <string id="94395">How did you end up in this forest?</string>
  <string id="94397">I am strong enough to do whatever they want without it affecting me.</string>
  <string id="94398">Why are you called the Black Whirlwind?</string>
  <string id="94399">Does that actually work?</string>
  <string id="94400">I think it might take more than that... for you anyway.</string>
  <string id="94402">So where *did* the name come from?</string>
  <string id="94405">I&apos;ve suddenly stopped caring.</string>
  <string id="94406">Don&apos;t think I&apos;ve forgotten that you attacked me when we met.</string>
  <string id="94408">That&apos;s all I need from you.</string>
  <string id="94410">What is it?</string>
  <string id="94411">When did you develop a stutter? Out with it.</string>
  <string id="94414">Get on with it, Whirlwind.</string>
  <string id="94415">Why haven&apos;t I heard about this before?</string>
  <string id="94417">I&apos;m missing the part where I should care about this.</string>
  <string id="94420">Have you ever considered settling down?</string>
  <string id="94422">You&apos;re a beast, Whirlwind.</string>
  <string id="94423">Where was your new wife during all this?</string>
  <string id="94424">That&apos;s one way to get to know your new family.</string>
  <string id="94426">You killed your wife&apos;s brother-in-law? By mistake?</string>
  <string id="94427">That must have made you very popular with the family.</string>
  <string id="94428">I could see how you might make that mistake.</string>
  <string id="94430">That&apos;s all for now.</string>
  <string id="94431">I&apos;d like to hear more about your past.</string>
  <string id="94434">I can&apos;t believe you got rats drunk.</string>
  <string id="94435">Ahh... this should be good.</string>
  <string id="94436">Were the rats the only ones who got drunk?</string>
  <string id="94438">The rats exploded? That&apos;s horrible!</string>
  <string id="94439">What happened to the monastery?</string>
  <string id="94440">Well, at least you got rid of the rats.</string>
  <string id="94441">That is by far the most stupid thing I&apos;ve ever heard.</string>
  <string id="94442" soundid="166946">I bet it was that fellow with the tattoos! You can&apos;t trust strangers these days!</string>
  <string id="94443" soundid="166947">I wager that fellow with the yellow sash is responsible. You can&apos;t trust wanderers, I say.</string>
  <string id="94444" soundid="166948">You&apos;ve seen that fellow in the robes? I bet it was him. He looks shifty.</string>
  <string id="94445" soundid="166949">It had to be that big fellow. Who else would be strong enough to break the controls?</string>
  <string id="94446" soundid="166950">It bet that girl in the blue outfit is responsible. She&apos;s not from around here.</string>
  <string id="94447" soundid="166951">Have you spotted the girl in the red and blue running around? I bet she&apos;s the reason.</string>
  <string id="94448" soundid="166952">Do they? Well, I say that strange girl in the plum outfit is the reason. She&apos;s not from around here.</string>
  <string id="94450" soundid="166954">Someone said the Great Southern Forest is less troubled than it was?</string>
  <string id="94451">What are your thoughts on our situation?</string>
  <string id="94461">Don&apos;t get all weepy on me now.</string>
  <string id="94464">We should get going, Whirlwind.</string>
  <string id="94467">Everyone&apos;s little to you.</string>
  <string id="94469">What do you mean?</string>
  <string id="94470">That&apos;s not surprising; fighting is all you do!</string>
  <string id="94473">Is your brother still fighting?</string>
  <string id="94474">More secrets, Whirlwind?</string>
  <string id="94476">Why did you kill him?</string>
  <string id="94477">How can you discuss this so calmly?</string>
  <string id="94479">Were you jealous of his success?</string>
  <string id="94483">That must have made things awkward between you two.</string>
  <string id="94484">Zu, why does this trouble you so much? You&apos;ve killed many before and since.</string>
  <string id="94485">Why didn&apos;t you stop him?</string>
  <string id="94490">A good excuse to justify your actions. Why don&apos;t you use it?</string>
  <string id="94493">What happened then?</string>
  <string id="94494">So you just killed your brother?</string>
  <string id="94500">Tell me more about yourself.</string>
  <string id="94501">What do you think about our current situation?</string>
  <string id="94504">That&apos;s all for now.</string>
  <string id="94505">You have no concerns about my decisions?</string>
  <string id="94508">Stay ready, friend. The final confrontation will come soon enough.</string>
  <string id="94509">Just be ready, or I will leave you behind, fool.</string>
  <string id="94510">Easy, friend. The battle will come soon enough. Ready yourself.</string>
  <string id="94514">We will go when I say, you reckless fool. No sooner.</string>
  <string id="94516" soundid="147138"></string>
  <string id="94517" soundid="147139">There, you got it.</string>
  <string id="94518" soundid="147140">That&apos;s beside the point for now. I must thank you, as I clearly owe you my life.</string>
  <string id="94519" soundid="147141">Well, you did, and now I owe you my life. I will happily repay that debt any way I can.</string>
  <string id="94520" soundid="147142">These cannibals were getting desperate enough to cook even someone as ropy as me. The last thing I needed was to be dragged into the caves below.</string>
  <string id="94521" soundid="147143">I heard a lot about the caves from the cannibals. There&apos;s something down there they call the Mother, and I think she...it, whatever, is what made them what they are.</string>
  <string id="94522" soundid="147144">She is some sort of greater demon the cannibals serve. I think she&apos;s the reason they&apos;re as twisted as they are.</string>
  <string id="94523" soundid="147145">From what I overheard, the Mother was trapped in this hill before Sagacious Tien forged the Jade Empire, but something has disturbed her.</string>
  <string id="94524" soundid="147146">I don&apos;t know how or why this Mother of theirs has returned to the world, but if she can do this to men, she must be stopped.</string>
  <string id="94525" soundid="147147">That is something I do not know. They would leave the inn and then return. I wasn&apos;t in a position to ask for details.</string>
  <string id="94526" soundid="147148">I don&apos;t know for sure, only that there are many more of them. From the sounds of it, they&apos;ve been capturing people and...changing them. The ones they don&apos;t eat, that is.</string>
  <string id="94527" soundid="163697">What am I going to do? If I go, I&apos;ll die. If I don&apos;t, my mother will die.</string>
  <string id="94528" soundid="147150">Is there anything else that I can help you with?</string>
  <string id="94529" soundid="147151">Well, they&apos;re cannibals! They were once men, but they were corrupted... twisted into flesh-eating abominations.</string>
  <string id="94530" soundid="147152">The Keeper, the one who met everyone, including yourself, at the door, had some skill with magic.</string>
  <string id="94531" soundid="147153">You might have seen through the illusion in time, but most people never get the chance. They&apos;re usually taken... or worse, changed into one of them.</string>
  <string id="94532" soundid="147154">They kept me around in hopes that I would make this place seem more normal, and they needed me to help run the inn. They&apos;re none too bright, really.</string>
  <string id="94533" soundid="147155">I resolved to try and tip off the first warrior who dared come to this place. The cannibals must be stopped.</string>
  <string id="94534" soundid="147156">They claim that they were changed by a creature called the Mother in the caves below.</string>
  <string id="94535" soundid="147157">Apparently, she&apos;s an ancient demon responsible for twisting these sick creatures.</string>
  <string id="94536" soundid="147158">A good idea. Even talking about them makes me queasy.</string>
  <string id="94537" soundid="147159">They spoke often about the Mother, in the caves nearby. They used this inn as a base and a way to lure people to increase their food stocks and swell their ranks. </string>
  <string id="94538" soundid="147160">What they failed to realize is that the forest is polluted with ghosts. No travelers means no food, whether people think this place is normal or not.</string>
  <string id="94539" soundid="147161">Maybe they had some plan around that, but I doubt it. They are not forward thinkers, these beasts. How it all ties together, I&apos;m not exactly sure.</string>
  <string id="94540" soundid="147162">I don&apos;t know what you have planned, exactly, but I hope you intend to finish the good work you started. </string>
  <string id="94541" soundid="147163">They were celebrating the release of the Mother not too long ago. Somehow she was freed from the Forest Shadow&apos;s trap... or cage. Something like that.</string>
  <string id="94542" soundid="147164">If you want to learn more, you&apos;ll need to face them directly. There&apos;s a new opening at the back of the kitchen that I think will take you deeper into the caves.</string>
  <string id="94543" soundid="147165">You killed the cannibals up here, but there&apos;s more in the caves below. I don&apos;t know how they got in or out or how they took prisoners down there.</string>
  <string id="94544" soundid="147166">I do know that they were terrified of something called the Forest Shadow. I&apos;m willing to bet that would be a good place to start.</string>
  <string id="94545" soundid="147167">If you&apos;re planning to tackle these beasts, I want to help... in my own way, of course. I&apos;m not much with my fists... not anymore, anyway.</string>
  <string id="94546" soundid="147168">But, you&apos;d be surprised what tricks an old bun master might know. Have you ever heard of Drunken Master style?</string>
  <string id="94547" soundid="147169">Drunken Master uses alcohol to loosen the body, deaden pain, and create unpredictable moves. It is unique, deadly, and entertaining all at once.</string>
  <string id="94548" soundid="147170">I was a master. Top of my game and well known in Phoenix Gate, one of the great cities in the Prosperous East. My skills earned me fame, fortune... and a wife.</string>
  <string id="94549" soundid="147171">You weren&apos;t listening. Fame, fortune, and a *wife*.</string>
  <string id="94550" soundid="147172">Teaching is all I can do. As I said, fame, fortune, and a *wife*.</string>
  <string id="94551" soundid="147173">I discovered fairly early on that she had... opinions. Most of them regarding alcohol, and my regular consumption of it.</string>
  <string id="94552" soundid="147174">I can still teach you, though. She has never expressly forbidden that. I have a few bottles on me right now, if you&apos;d like to learn.</string>
  <string id="94553" soundid="147175">Pay attention. I don&apos;t like repeating myself. Now, when I am with you, I can throw you bottles of wine. You must pick these up in order to use Drunken Master.</string>
  <string id="94554" soundid="147176">I don&apos;t care what they&apos;re offering you, you can&apos;t let these things live!</string>
  <string id="94555" soundid="147177">Er, hello. Welcome to the Pilgrim&apos;s Rest, where the patron is the most important part of our business.</string>
  <string id="94556" soundid="147178">Also home to a bloodthirsty collection of cannibals and their twisted demon Mother goddess. Oh, and one soon-to-be-dead cook.</string>
  <string id="94557" soundid="147179">I am Henpecked Hou, a simple bun master who has been enslaved in this awful place. But there are even greater things at stake than my life.</string>
  <string id="94558" soundid="147180">I know the Forest Shadow is dead. The earth heaved against itself as the caves below opened.</string>
  <string id="94559" soundid="147181">That doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s too late! If you could defeat her, then surly you can defeat these beasts!</string>
  <string id="94560" soundid="147182">Please, find a way to stop these beasts. The only thing they seem to fear is this Forest Shadow.</string>
  <string id="94561" soundid="147183">Perhaps she can help you. I beg of you, please try.</string>
  <string id="94562" soundid="147184">I am Hou, your humble cook. I&apos;m also in charge of the few supplies the inn actually stocks, if you have need of them.</string>
  <string id="94563" soundid="147185">Though I am weary and worked to the bone, I&apos;m here to help you. What can I do for you today?</string>
  <string id="94564" soundid="147186">Hello again. Can I interest you in some of my simple items?</string>
  <string id="94565" soundid="147187">There&apos;s...nothing, it&apos;s nothing. I just thought... well, I was hoping that... would you like a bun?</string>
  <string id="94566" soundid="147188">[Success] I... I can&apos;t tell you... not here, not now. They&apos;re listening.</string>
  <string id="94567" soundid="147189">[Success] Ask *him?* He might give you an answer you do not want. But if you must, then do so forewarned.</string>
  <string id="94568" soundid="147190">[Success] Perhaps you could... though I&apos;m not so sure.</string>
  <string id="94569" soundid="147191">Go and speak to the Innkeeper. Ask him about the twisted servants of The Mother. See how he reacts to that!</string>
  <string id="94570" soundid="147192">Be prepared when you speak to him! That&apos;s all I&apos;m saying about this.</string>
  <string id="94571" soundid="147193">[Failure] It&apos;s...nothing. I&apos;m sure you have bigger things to worry about.</string>
  <string id="94572" soundid="147194">Yes. I&apos;m sure you will.</string>
  <string id="94573" soundid="147195">I&apos;d be happy to. I&apos;m sure you understand that my stocks are limited.</string>
  <string id="94574" soundid="147196">In fact, if you think about it, with the ghosts filling the forest, I shouldn&apos;t have *any* supplies at all.</string>
  <string id="94575" soundid="147197">Yes, yes it is. Ah well, have a look, and tell me if you see anything you like.</string>
  <string id="94576" soundid="147198">Of course. Here you are.</string>
  <string id="94577" soundid="147199">I don&apos;t know much about this forest at all. I was only passing through when I, ah... stopped at this inn. It turned out to be a longer stay than I anticipated.</string>
  <string id="94578" soundid="147200">I&apos;m sorry I can&apos;t be of more help. However, as shop keeper I do have some items that you might be interested in.</string>
  <string id="94579" soundid="147201">How very lucky for me. I seem to just stumble into these situations.</string>
  <string id="94580" soundid="147202">There&apos;s not much I can tell you, to be fair. You should ask the Keeper. I&apos;m sure he&apos;ll be happy to tell you his side of things.</string>
  <string id="94581" soundid="147203">I&apos;m sorry I can&apos;t be of more help. Maybe you should ask the Keeper.</string>
  <string id="94582" soundid="147204">I don&apos;t really go in for celestial politics, but I will say that it&apos;s awfully odd that the inn folk seem to hate her so.</string>
  <string id="94583" soundid="147205">To hear them talk, she&apos;s practically insane with bloodlust. But everything here *seems* perfectly normal, wouldn&apos;t you say?</string>
  <string id="94584" soundid="147206">No, no it doesn&apos;t. But why then are they so scared of this Forest Shadow? Well, I&apos;ve probably said enough.</string>
  <string id="94585" soundid="147207">Ah, well, if she attacked you, then she must be mad as a mountain farmer. Unless there was some mistaken identity, of course.</string>
  <string id="94586" soundid="147208">The Keeper has more than enough to say for both of us about the Forest Shadow. Go ask him if you have more questions.</string>
  <string id="94587" soundid="147209">If only it were that easy... to go that is.</string>
  <string id="94588" soundid="147210">That&apos;s...a very good point. I suppose I&apos;ll try to find the sunny side of this situation.</string>
  <string id="94589" soundid="147211">That&apos;s more like it. Now you&apos;re more in line with the spirit around here.</string>
  <string id="94590" soundid="147212">Take very good care.</string>
  <string id="94591" soundid="147213"></string>
  <string id="94592" soundid="147214">I can&apos;t believe my luck. I arrive home after being lost only to find that my wife has gone off to visit relatives.</string>
  <string id="94593" soundid="147215">No, you misunderstand me. My wife... she&apos;s not here. I thought I was as good as dead, now my execution is delayed... until her eventual return, of course.</string>
  <string id="94594" soundid="147216">I am very happy, indeed. Instead of dying upon my return home, I am free... until she returns, of course.</string>
  <string id="94595" soundid="147217">Yes, yes. Of course, anything you like. Today I am feeling... impulsive.</string>
  <string id="94596" soundid="147218">Yes? How can this humble bun master assist you today?</string>
  <string id="94603" soundid="147225">You&apos;re beginning to sound like my wife. Where were you last night? Why were you talking to that woman? Why do you smell like a goat? Always with the questions.</string>
  <string id="94604" soundid="147226">As I mentioned earlier, after becoming tournament champion for the second time, I was forced to marry my sponsor&apos;s nubile niece. *She* is the reason I no longer fight.</string>
  <string id="94605" soundid="147227">My disapproving dove did not care for my drinking, or for my friends, or my fighting, or my friends fighting. She believed I should settle down, be more respectable.</string>
  <string id="94606" soundid="147228">At first I ignored her rebukes and continued fighting, but I soon learned that she was not a woman to be crossed.</string>
  <string id="94607" soundid="147229">Prior to one fight, my duplicitous daisy drugged my wine. I don&apos;t remember much of what happened next, which is fortunate. From what I hear it wasn&apos;t very pretty.</string>
  <string id="94608" soundid="147230">I spent the next several months under the tender ministrations of my doting wife. Needless to say, when I was well enough to walk again I was more than happy to... settle down.</string>
  <string id="94610">You&apos;re not teaching new styles, then?</string>
  <string id="94611">Focus Shrine</string>
  <string id="94612">I&apos;ll pass for now.</string>
  <string id="94613" soundid="166605">Do what you have to, and let&apos;s get back to the palace. I don&apos;t want to lose the element of surprise entirely.</string>
  <string id="94614" soundid="166606">Ya, Zhen. We waste time in petty errands while spectacular prey waits for you in the palace. Hurry up... master.</string>
  <string id="94615" soundid="166607">Chai Ka: Your destiny awaits you in the palace. We should not delay much longer.</string>
  <string id="94616" soundid="147238">We made it this far; how hard can it be from here? From what I&apos;ve seen you&apos;re more than capable of handling anything we&apos;re likely to encounter.</string>
  <string id="94617">Reverse Order</string>
  <string id="94618" soundid="147240">I can&apos;t believe that Silk Fox and Princess Lian are one in the same. She&apos;s a tough woman, maybe tougher than my wife, and far more beau--ahem, bold.</string>
  <string id="94619" soundid="147241">But her plan to infiltrate the Lotus Assassin fortress seems more than a little foolhardy. Those Assassins are trained killers. Even my wife fears them.</string>
  <string id="94620" soundid="147242">On the upside, if I die at the hands of the Lotus Assassins, I won&apos;t have to face my lovely wife when she returns. [sigh] I should have stayed with the cannibals.</string>
  <string id="94621" soundid="147243">I think you need somebody like me to keep your camp in order while you&apos;re off invading the fortress. I can make sure there&apos;s some hot soup waiting for you.</string>
  <string id="94623" soundid="147245">Turtle egg soup perhaps... now, there&apos;s a thought. Where did I put those turtle eggs?</string>
  <string id="94624" soundid="147246">I&apos;ve seen many things in my life that scare me, many of them with you, I might add. This place terrifies me. My knees are shaking so badly I&apos;m going to have bruises.</string>
  <string id="94625" soundid="147247">These Assassins are very well trained. They obey without question, pay no heed to their pain or their needs, and they work tirelessly for their masters, with little reward.</string>
  <string id="94626" soundid="147248">Come to think of it, they live a life much like mine. But then, they don&apos;t have to share a bed with my wife.</string>
  <string id="94627" soundid="147249">I can&apos;t believe we&apos;re actually going to see the Emperor himself. This is a most propitious day. If my wife were here, she&apos;d... actually, I&apos;d rather not think about that.</string>
  <string id="94628" soundid="147250">I am, however, looking forward to meeting your master. I&apos;d like to know if he&apos;s familiar with my Drunken Master style. But I suppose we should get ready to go.</string>
  <string id="94629" soundid="147251">Just give me the word, and I&apos;ll get the camp packed up and ready to go.</string>
  <string id="94630" soundid="147252">I can&apos;t believe we&apos;re actually inside the Emperor&apos;s palace. I must admit, I feel as though I&apos;m trespassing... like I don&apos;t belong here.</string>
  <string id="94631" soundid="147253">Perhaps the Emperor can give me some courage... I seem to have lost mine.</string>
  <string id="94632" soundid="147254">My prescient pretty has an uncanny knack for derailing my plans, in case you haven&apos;t already noticed. I have tried several times to leave, but it always fails miserably.</string>
  <string id="94633" soundid="147255">Some say there are spirits out there that masquerade as people, and I suspect she may be one of them. She has my soul, and there&apos;s nothing I can do about it.</string>
  <string id="94634" soundid="147256">One time, I tried to sneak away while she was delivering a special order of buns to her uncle&apos;s family. As I started to leave, I slipped on some oil and broke my arm.</string>
  <string id="94635" soundid="147257">Still, I put my arm in a sling and was continuing on my way when I was run down by a rogue bun cart. When I came to, my wife had returned and was in a foul mood.</string>
  <string id="94636" soundid="147258">Apparently, everyone she had visited died from food poisoning. But why not her? I mean, I&apos;m sure she ate at least one of the buns I sent.</string>
  <string id="94637" soundid="147259">I am saying no such thing.</string>
  <string id="94638" soundid="147260">It is simply my lot in life to be given into the care of a demon whose sole sustenance comes from sucking the very life from my body and soul. [sigh] Soup anyone?</string>
  <string id="94639" soundid="147261">Good, good. I&apos;ll be here, struggling to keep up with you, if you should need anything.</string>
  <string id="94640" soundid="147262">As you say. I will be here scrubbing your pots until you call upon me again.</string>
  <string id="94641" soundid="166417">Is this the one?</string>
  <string id="94642" soundid="147264">Stories, stories, stories... there are no more. If I tell you anything more, I will have no secrets left. A good bun master must always have a few secrets.</string>
  <string id="94643" soundid="147265">Not now. Memories of my wife are... difficult to bear. Especially when I am here and she could be so far, far... far away.</string>
  <string id="94645" soundid="156199">Another of Gang&apos;s weakling acolytes headed to the slaughter. How many have the ghosts killed so far?</string>
  <string id="94646" soundid="156200">Eleven? Twelve? Does it matter? Worthless as one, worthless as a group.</string>
  <string id="94647" soundid="156201">So, you crawl back. Ready for your inevitable fate, trainer? We can&apos;t have Gang&apos;s acolytes getting too skilled, can we?</string>
  <string id="94648" soundid="156202">I am ready if you think you are, trainer.</string>
  <string id="94649" soundid="156203">You killed Kai Feng? But he was fully trained.</string>
  <string id="94650" soundid="156204">Such insolence will not go unpunished. We&apos;ll make an example of you soon enough. Your corpse will be dragged before your master!</string>
  <string id="94651" soundid="147273"></string>
  <string id="94652" soundid="147274"></string>
  <string id="94653" soundid="147275"></string>
  <string id="94654" soundid="147276">We are victorious, but how long will this peace last?</string>
  <string id="94655" soundid="147277">The day already drags like an overloaded ox. Our enemies should be more efficient.</string>
  <string id="94656" soundid="147278">I do not shy from meaningful combat, but eliminating your boredom is not a worthwhile cause to fight for.</string>
  <string id="94657" soundid="147279">If there&apos;s no wine, there should be fighting. That&apos;s the way of things for a warrior.</string>
  <string id="94658" soundid="147280">We should not take much longer to lick our wounds, even if the victory was ours. No doubt the enemy awaits us.</string>
  <string id="94659" soundid="147281">I agree. While the victory was ours, another battle looms. The enemy is no doubt waiting for us to make a move.</string>
  <string id="94660" soundid="147282"></string>
  <string id="94661" soundid="147283">I find this matter most unsettling.</string>
  <string id="94662" soundid="147284">What? He&apos;s a damn good fighter. Better to have him as an ally than an enemy.</string>
  <string id="94663" soundid="147285">He&apos;s not an ally, he&apos;s... enslaved.</string>
  <string id="94664" soundid="147286">At least we know where he is. It might be best to leave him this way.</string>
  <string id="94665" soundid="147287">Can you blame us? There is an unsettling new presence in the group.</string>
  <string id="94666" soundid="147288">An odd kind of trophy to collect. Very hard to display without reaction.</string>
  <string id="94667" soundid="147289">It is just a discussion about the presence you have introduced into the group.</string>
  <string id="94668" soundid="147290">He is more useful the way he is. He did a great deal of damage. We could use him to repair it.</string>
  <string id="94669" soundid="147291">He has the fate he deserves. What better use is there for an old enemy?</string>
  <string id="94670" soundid="147292">It is not right. Such a torment to inflict.</string>
  <string id="94671" soundid="147293">This is not right. Such an honored person should not be tormented in this manner. It was wrong before, and it is wrong now.</string>
  <string id="94672" soundid="147294">It pains me to see anyone so devoid of free will.</string>
  <string id="94673" soundid="147295"></string>
  <string id="94674" soundid="147296"></string>
  <string id="94675" soundid="147297">A troubling thing, but war pushes many to make foolish choices.</string>
  <string id="94676" soundid="147298">A foolish choice? Sky nearly damned us all. That is more than a simple mistake.</string>
  <string id="94677" soundid="147299">It was a selfish thing, and I am inclined to let him suffer the consequences. He risked everything for a hopeless promise.</string>
  <string id="94678" soundid="147300">Do you seek vengeance? I like this darker side of you, but was the act so surprising? Our leader appears to condone far worse.</string>
  <string id="94679" soundid="147301">Are suggesting that everything until now has led to the binding of Death&apos;s Hand and that environment has let other evils flourish?</string>
  <string id="94680" soundid="147302">It is something to ponder. Perhaps we will have our answer in what punishment is chosen for our weak willed friend.</string>
  <string id="94681" soundid="147303">Are you looking for vengeance? For once we may be in agreement. What does this darkened Dawn Star recommend? Prison? Death?</string>
  <string id="94682" soundid="147304">Look beyond the act. If we ignore his pain, we cannot fully understand what led to this.</string>
  <string id="94683" soundid="147305">Are you saying that Sky was prompted to do this because our leader appears to condone far worse?</string>
  <string id="94684" soundid="147306">Sky&apos;s actions stand apart from the binding of Death&apos;s Hand or any other &quot;evil.&quot; Let the poor rogue answer for his actions, and let Death&apos;s Hand rot if he is useful to us.</string>
  <string id="94685" soundid="147307">The binding of Death&apos;s Hand was a... regrettable evil that I know will be rectified. It does not mean that everything up until now contributed to it or Sky&apos;s betrayal.</string>
  <string id="94686" soundid="147308">We will let the one affected most decide what is the proper course of action.</string>
  <string id="94687" soundid="147309">The reasons do not matter. He risked everything, and I will not trust him again. Death is the only acceptable option.</string>
  <string id="94688" soundid="147310">The choice is not ours to make. That task is left to the one affected most.</string>
  <string id="94689" soundid="147311">There&apos;s always too much talk after a battle. Axes are better than words for deciding things.</string>
  <string id="94690" soundid="147312">Your weapons will see some use soon enough, you oaf. This pathetic whelp deserves no less.</string>
  <string id="94691" soundid="147313">Perhaps it is fortunate that there are others here who may wish to have a say in his fate.</string>
  <string id="94692" soundid="147314">I will speak for myself! No one else has the right to.</string>
  <string id="94693" soundid="147315">I... I am not going to make excuses, but try to understand me, and I will accept whatever comes.</string>
  <string id="94694" soundid="147316">Traveling with you, I realized that finding the people who killed my daughter would bring no peace. I had to destroy the power that had led to her death.</string>
  <string id="94695" soundid="147317">There was a taint that led from Gao all the way to the Emperor. When even he was gone, someone else claimed the evil for themselves. There is no end.</string>
  <string id="94696" soundid="147318">Everyone sought to benefit. Even you seem beyond mortal concerns. When Master Li is gone, will you be any different from him?</string>
  <string id="94697" soundid="147319">Destroying the power behind it all began to lose meaning. If avenging my daughter meant nothing, what else could I do to bring her spirit peace?</string>
  <string id="94698" soundid="147320">I have seen the evil you are capable of. The binding of Death&apos;s Hand is only the latest example. You are not so different from the enemy.</string>
  <string id="94699" soundid="147321">I have seen the evil that taints you. Whether you choose to admit it or not, you are closer to the enemy than to the rest of us.</string>
  <string id="94700" soundid="147322">Death&apos;s Hand spoke of a small hope. If all parts are equal, I began to feel I should help the one who seemed willing to help me.</string>
  <string id="94701" soundid="147323">It was a shallow dream. I know it. I always did. But your actions did nothing to counter it.</string>
  <string id="94702" soundid="147324">I am weak, but so are you. So is your master. So is everyone. I am sorry, but I had to try. I await judgment from those I endangered.</string>
  <string id="94703" soundid="147325">You don&apos;t wish to hear what led him to this? Er... perhaps it would be wise, just to ensure it does not happen again?</string>
  <string id="94704" soundid="147326">Then I await your judgment. I will say no more.</string>
  <string id="94705" soundid="147327">Who will decide his fate?</string>
  <string id="94706" soundid="147328">As you decided the fate of our newest member?</string>
  <string id="94707" soundid="147329">That is your right. I&apos;m sure the judgment will be fair.</string>
  <string id="94708" soundid="147330">I am not quite so sure.</string>
  <string id="94709" soundid="147331">To which of us do you speak? Does the newest addition get to vote as well?</string>
  <string id="94710" soundid="147332">Binding the spirit of a member of the royal family is not acceptable.</string>
  <string id="94711" soundid="147333">I must agree. Death&apos;s Hand has caused much pain, but if Prince Kin was also the victim of our true enemy, shouldn&apos;t he be allowed some peace?</string>
  <string id="94712" soundid="147334">I do not like what this means, especially for your ability to make it happen. I am also surprised that the Princess has not stood up for her relative.</string>
  <string id="94713" soundid="147335">My words may not be of much value anymore, but I am greatly saddened that Death&apos;s Hand stands beside you while I am at your feet.</string>
  <string id="94714" soundid="147336">You earned that place! Death&apos;s Hand is a shell to be commanded. There is no question of *his* loyalty.</string>
  <string id="94715" soundid="147337">I am more interested in how you made it happen. Having him here is troubling, but I see that he could be useful.</string>
  <string id="94716" soundid="147338">Let his spirit rot. It is not as if the honored Prince Kin did not earn his fate. Much as Sky earned his.</string>
  <string id="94717" soundid="147339">I do not like that he is here. It seems... cruel, even if he was our enemy.</string>
  <string id="94718" soundid="147340">Tools must be respected, but they are still just tools.</string>
  <string id="94719" soundid="147341">That could apply to any of us. That is why this is cause for concern.</string>
  <string id="94720" soundid="147342">I cannot support this. His spirit should be allowed some peace. I... I can&apos;t follow you if you approve of this.</string>
  <string id="94721" soundid="147343">As a member of the royal family, I must protest. You cannot do this if you want my support.</string>
  <string id="94722" soundid="147344">I don&apos;t care if he goes or stays, but the twisting of a man&apos;s soul should not be allowed.</string>
  <string id="94723" soundid="147345">Though I am already at your feet, I cannot condone this... binding you have done.</string>
  <string id="94724" soundid="147346">It would seem the group is somewhat divided on the matter. I don&apos;t care what happens to Death&apos;s Hand.</string>
  <string id="94725" soundid="147347">Such a thing is not natural. I... won&apos;t follow you if this continues. I&apos;d rather face my wife again.</string>
  <string id="94726" soundid="147348">Chai Ka: Such binding locks the will of the victim. They are held in service and must obey, although they see and feel everything they are forced to do.</string>
  <string id="94727" soundid="147349">Chai Ka: Though useful in retrieving wayward ghosts, on the living it becomes a torture most foul. Spirit Monks were forbidden to do such a thing.</string>
  <string id="94728" soundid="147350">Another surprise from your time among the dead? You continue to be an extraordinary person.</string>
  <string id="94729" soundid="147351">You have the ability to do such a thing? I suppose there may be no choice if we want to succeed.</string>
  <string id="94730" soundid="147352">I should not approve, but our ultimate goal cannot fail for the sake of some petty freedoms.</string>
  <string id="94731" soundid="147353">You would strip away my will? What is my loyalty worth if it is forced?</string>
  <string id="94732" soundid="147354">Please, don&apos;t do this. Our time together means nothing if it is forced. Can&apos;t you see I must oppose you out of love?</string>
  <string id="94733" soundid="147355">If it must be done. Come on, let&apos;s get this over with so we can get to our next battle.</string>
  <string id="94734" soundid="147356"></string>
  <string id="94735" soundid="147357">I don&apos;t know if I really know who you are anymore.</string>
  <string id="94736" soundid="147358">This is not the path I thought you were on.</string>
  <string id="94737" soundid="147359">I&apos;m sorry that we could not move beyond this.</string>
  <string id="94738" soundid="147360">Finally! Let&apos;s get going so we can find our next fight.</string>
  <string id="94739" soundid="147361"></string>
  <string id="94740" soundid="147362">I doubt it will be as easy as that to assuage the fears of those involved. You toy with spirits just like our enemies do. </string>
  <string id="94741" soundid="147363">I am glad that it is so easily resolved. Er... you will do as you have said, won&apos;t you?</string>
  <string id="94742" soundid="147364">I am... free... after all the years. Free!</string>
  <string id="94743" soundid="147365"></string>
  <string id="94745" soundid="147367">Please, remember the person you were before all this talk of power. </string>
  <string id="94746" soundid="147368">You would dare attempt to steal my will? I could not imagine a more horrible fate.</string>
  <string id="94747" soundid="147369">Has our time together meant nothing? You don&apos;t know me at all if you would suggest this.</string>
  <string id="94748" soundid="147370">This is not acceptable. It would seem you are a very different person from who I thought you were. </string>
  <string id="94749" soundid="147371">I could suffer the imprisonment of my body, but having my mind taken would be a horror.</string>
  <string id="94750" soundid="147372">We have shared so much. Why throw it all away? I only oppose this out of concern for you.</string>
  <string id="94751" soundid="147373">You know me. This would be unbearable. Won&apos;t you listen to reason?</string>
  <string id="94752" soundid="147374">Ya Zhen: Mmm... such binding holds the will of the victim. They are forced to obey your every whim, but they see themselves commit each act and can wail their shame.</string>
  <string id="94753" soundid="147375">Ya Zhen: It could be used to shepherd spirits gone mad, but on the living it is sublime torture. Spirit Monks were forbidden to indulge in such ways.</string>
  <string id="94754" soundid="147376">He brought us more fools to fight. Where&apos;s the harm in that?  Let him live... or die fighting, but let&apos;s get it over with.</string>
  <string id="94755" soundid="147377">Some of us find it a little more difficult to... appreciate the threat he created.</string>
  <string id="94756" soundid="147378">Chai Ka: Fair judgment is all that I ask.</string>
  <string id="94757" soundid="147379">One must always accept responsibility for what one creates.</string>
  <string id="94758" soundid="147380">And that means he should be killed. It&apos;s the only penalty appropriate for what he has done.</string>
  <string id="94759" soundid="147381">He was weak. He has shown regret. Should we be so quick to end his life?</string>
  <string id="94760" soundid="147382">Yes.</string>
  <string id="94761" soundid="147383">I can&apos;t agree to that. Imprisonment, perhaps, but not death.</string>
  <string id="94762" soundid="147384">I am resigned to whatever you decide. I am at your feet.</string>
  <string id="94763" soundid="147385">This is not wise! He is a proven risk.</string>
  <string id="94764" soundid="147386">While I might not have agreed with execution, I have to say that I don&apos;t trust him, either.</string>
  <string id="94765" soundid="147387">Bah! Danger in front or danger in back; only a fool forgets to keep an eye in both directions.</string>
  <string id="94766" soundid="147388">I thank you. I will not let your faith be in vain.</string>
  <string id="94767" soundid="147389">If this unpleasant matter is behind us, we will need to decide where to go next. We can&apos;t stay here indefinitely.</string>
  <string id="94768" soundid="147390">Agreed. This peace will not last. It would not be wise to wait for another assault.</string>
  <string id="94769" soundid="147391">Chai Ka: Emperor Sun Li waits for us, growing in power. He is draining the Water Dragon far faster than Sun Hai ever managed.</string>
  <string id="94770" soundid="147392">Er, I appreciate the need for haste, but the Marvelous Dragonfly will need some adjustments. The landing here was... rough.</string>
  <string id="94771" soundid="147393">A good idea. It will allow for some adjustments to the Marvelous Dragonfly. The landing here was... rough.</string>
  <string id="94772" soundid="147394">I admire the optimistic view of our numbers, but we could march to the end of the Empire and it would do no good. The palace is, as you know, elevated.</string>
  <string id="94773" soundid="147395">I will ferry whom I can for an initial assault. Give me a few moments. We will leave at your command... when my work is done.</string>
  <string id="94774" soundid="147396">Ya Zhen: Emperor Sun Li is growing stronger. The Water Dragon is yielding more power to him than the previous tyrant ever managed to consume.</string>
  <string id="94775" soundid="147397">I... I understand. I will not tempt your wrath further.</string>
  <string id="94776" soundid="147398">You just don&apos;t have the capacity for forgiveness that our leader does. That&apos;s a failing I&apos;m glad you&apos;ve kept to yourself.</string>
  <string id="94777" soundid="147399">Chai Ka: Such binding locks the will of the victim. They are bound into service and must obey, although they remain aware of what they are forced to do.</string>
  <string id="94778" soundid="147400">Chai Ka: Though useful in retrieving wayward ghosts, on the living it becomes the worst of tortures. Spirit Monks were forbidden to do such a thing.</string>
  <string id="94779" soundid="147401">This skill must be another surprise from your time among the dead. You continue to be an extraordinary person.</string>
  <string id="94780" soundid="147402">You would strip away my will? What is my loyalty worth if it is forced?</string>
  <string id="94781" soundid="147403">Please, don&apos;t do this. Our time together means nothing if it is forced. Can&apos;t you see I must oppose you out of love?</string>
  <string id="94782" soundid="147404">It has to be done. We need to move forward, and this is the only way.</string>
  <string id="94783" soundid="147405"></string>
  <string id="94784" soundid="147406">Thank you for your mercy. I prefer my mind and body to be as much a team as possible.</string>
  <string id="94785" soundid="147407">Thank you. One day I will earn your trust again.</string>
  <string id="94786" soundid="147408"></string>
  <string id="94787" soundid="147409">Please! Have pity on him!</string>
  <string id="94788" soundid="147410">The time for reason has passed, I fear. Just because we have stood by our principles doesn&apos;t mean they will have any effect.</string>
  <string id="94789" soundid="147411">I respect your judgment.</string>
  <string id="94790" soundid="147412"></string>
  <string id="94791" soundid="147413">I accept my fate.</string>
  <string id="94793" soundid="190467">I saw Jade Empire as a chance to branch out into more... legitimate acting. I get a lot of comments about what I used to do on stage, but you do what you have to when you are starting out.</string>
  <string id="94794" soundid="147416">Please, remember the person you were before all this talk of power. </string>
  <string id="94795" soundid="147417">It seems a useful skill, and as a substitute for execution, it is the lesser of two cruelties, in my mind.</string>
  <string id="94796" soundid="147418">It lets him live and yet be trusted and useful. An elegant solution.</string>
  <string id="94797" soundid="147419">I would rather be locked away than be a prisoner in my own body! You must know this will be torture for me!</string>
  <string id="94798" soundid="147420">Finally! Let&apos;s get this over with so we can find a new fight.</string>
  <string id="94799" soundid="147421"></string>
  <string id="94800" soundid="147422">A chilling ability. I can&apos;t think of anything more monstrous... but it is preferable to killing him.</string>
  <string id="94801" soundid="147423">Ya Zhen: Mmm... such binding holds the will of the victim. They are forced to obey your every whim, but they see each act and can wail their shame.</string>
  <string id="94802" soundid="147424">Ya Zhen: It could be used to shepherd wayward spirits, but on the living it is sublime torture. Spirit Monks were forbidden to indulge in such ways.</string>
  <string id="94803" soundid="147425">Acceptable, if a bit too lenient.</string>
  <string id="94804" soundid="147426">I will strive to restore your trust in me. Someday I will.</string>
  <string id="94805" soundid="147427"></string>
  <string id="94806" soundid="147428">An example must be made. Unfortunate, but necessary.</string>
  <string id="94807" soundid="147429">I understand. I hope in the future I can restore your faith in me.</string>
  <string id="94808" soundid="147430"></string>
  <string id="94809" soundid="147431">Yes, the cost of disobedience must be enforced.</string>
  <string id="94810" soundid="147432">No! Are we no better than those we face? This is simple murder! I cannot let this stand.</string>
  <string id="94811" soundid="147433">My love... please. You know I could never fight you, but I can&apos;t follow where you are leading. Will no one else stand up against this?</string>
  <string id="94812" soundid="147434">I could never beat you, and we both know it. I simply cannot follow you if you do this. Will no one else stand up for Sky&apos;s life?</string>
  <string id="94813" soundid="147435">I... would agree with Miss Dawn Star.</string>
  <string id="94814" soundid="147436">I am grateful for your mercy.</string>
  <string id="94815" soundid="147437">Hold! Sky&apos;s fate is of no concern to me, but we cannot slaughter everyone who disagrees with you. They may be needed.</string>
  <string id="94816" soundid="147438">Er, yes! I am ever so useful!</string>
  <string id="94817" soundid="147439">Have some dignity, Hou. I will not follow this path, no matter the penalty.</string>
  <string id="94818" soundid="147440">I... don&apos;t have anything more satisfying to offer, but it just seems a waste of life. I can&apos;t follow such a course. Will anyone else speak up?</string>
  <string id="94819" soundid="147441">You are on your own, fool.</string>
  <string id="94820" soundid="147442">I&apos;m sorry, but Sky is a threat we cannot afford to have at our backs.</string>
  <string id="94821" soundid="147443">Perhaps I have acted too hastily. I... don&apos;t wish to call my own loyalty into question.</string>
  <string id="94822" soundid="147444">Harsh, but perhaps necessary.</string>
  <string id="94823" soundid="147445">I must agree. Who will... carry out this sentence?</string>
  <string id="94824" soundid="147446">If this is the way it must be, I am ready.</string>
  <string id="94825" soundid="147447"></string>
  <string id="94826" soundid="147448">If this is the way it must be, I accept my fate.</string>
  <string id="94827" soundid="147449">Another reason to be rid of you. Only fools accept death willingly! Goodbye, thief.</string>
  <string id="94828" soundid="187291">Ask Minister Sheng about it, if you like. I&apos;m sure he&apos;d be more than happy to complain to you about another problem he hasn&apos;t been able to solve.</string>
  <string id="94829" soundid="147451">In time, it might be forgiven. I cannot fight you, but I will not follow you if you do this. Will anyone else stand up for Sky&apos;s life?</string>
  <string id="94830" soundid="147452">Er... I&apos;m afraid I must respectfully disagree with this... course of action.</string>
  <string id="94831" soundid="147453">His crime is too grave. Imprisonment at the least. Death is... not out of the question.</string>
  <string id="94832" soundid="147454">Well, I&apos;m inclined to agree with Dawn Star. I&apos;m impressed with the effect you have had on her.</string>
  <string id="94833" soundid="147455">He has risked too much. Death would be severe, but not completely undeserved. Imprisonment would be the least I would accept.</string>
  <string id="94834" soundid="147456">Imprisonment is... not out of the question. I would prefer a more understanding approach, but at least it would allow hope for the future.</string>
  <string id="94835" soundid="147457">Ya Zhen: Destruction is my wish. Cast him to the depths.</string>
  <string id="94836" soundid="147458">We may need to call on your services. This traitor has certainly earned it.</string>
  <string id="94837" soundid="147459">There are others here who may wish to express a preference in this matter.</string>
  <string id="94838" soundid="147460">We don&apos;t need to do anything rash just yet. There are others here with a stake in his fate.</string>
  <string id="94839" soundid="147461">In a quick and bloody fashion, I hope.</string>
  <string id="94840" soundid="147462">In a manner that shows the seriousness of the crime, I hope.</string>
  <string id="94841" soundid="147463">His stupidity led him here. Lock him away while we move on, and we can deal with the subtleties of it at our leisure.</string>
  <string id="94842" soundid="147464"></string>
  <string id="94843" soundid="147465"></string>
  <string id="94844" soundid="147466">It would seem that the group is again... of one mind.</string>
  <string id="94845" soundid="147467">Who cares what brings them to the front line, as long as they fight when they get there.</string>
  <string id="94846" soundid="147468">You have removed all choice in the matter. The weakest ploy of a poor leader.</string>
  <string id="94847" soundid="147469">Perhaps it is best that you are held this way. All others in your family descended to treachery eventually.</string>
  <string id="94848" soundid="147470">Examine your own weakness before daring to judge your betters, little Dawn Star. You would be here if you were stronger!</string>
  <string id="94849" soundid="147471">You must see that these are not the actions of a just man.</string>
  <string id="94850" soundid="147472">I am free to move because I know that lost causes are lost for a reason. The threat we face has... changed what is truly right or wrong.</string>
  <string id="94851" soundid="147473">While I do not wish to take sides in the... management of my fellows, I must agree that we need to move forward.</string>
  <string id="94852" soundid="147474">A leader? No, the actions of a slaver.</string>
  <string id="94853" soundid="147475">I hold more pity than hatred for Death&apos;s Hand now. He endured this for twenty years.</string>
  <string id="94854" soundid="147476">He fell because he was naive, and we have done the same. The &quot;savior&quot; of the Empire is just another tyrant in the making.</string>
  <string id="94855" soundid="147477">What choice do I have? You have taken my will. I will follow you to the ends of the Empire, but it will mean nothing.</string>
  <string id="94856" soundid="147478">Pretty little thing, forced to see what it truly takes to attain power in this world. A tragedy I am lucky to witness.</string>
  <string id="94857" soundid="147479">A greater tragedy is how you have fallen. If you accept this, what about your beloved Empire? What will become of it when our leader&apos;s evil replaces Master Li&apos;s?</string>
  <string id="94858" soundid="147480">A pity your ability does not bind her mouth as well.</string>
  <string id="94859" soundid="147481">It might not have been necessary if you had shown proper loyalty. Certain acts may seem... unseemly, but we fight a greater evil!</string>
  <string id="94860" soundid="147482">And becoming like that evil is the solution? I won&apos;t... I can&apos;t.</string>
  <string id="94861" soundid="147483">I hold pity for Death&apos;s Hand. He endured this for twenty years.</string>
  <string id="94862" soundid="147484">You deserve worse for endangering all of us... for risking the Empire.</string>
  <string id="94863" soundid="147485">I have to agree. You are forever a traitor. We could not have you at our backs unbound.</string>
  <string id="94864" soundid="147486">I regret this action, but better this than dead for a foolish act.</string>
  <string id="94865" soundid="147487"></string>
  <string id="94866" soundid="147488">Peace is restored to the group, but our number is... reduced.</string>
  <string id="94867" soundid="147489">Ha! More enemies for me. What&apos;s wrong with that?</string>
  <string id="94868" soundid="147490">It may be a little more difficult to achieve our goals with our limited resources, but I will enjoy the added peace and quiet.</string>
  <string id="94869" soundid="147491">We do what must be done. The sooner we leave this unpleasantness behind, the better.</string>
  <string id="94870" soundid="147492">Who wants peace and quiet? Let&apos;s take the fight to the enemy and shake the very heavens with our battle cries!</string>
  <string id="94871" soundid="147493">Perhaps the ranks needed to be thinned, but the sooner we put this behind us, the better.</string>
  <string id="94872" soundid="147494">If that is what you want, I&apos;m sure you will get it in abundance. I certainly don&apos;t look forward to confronting our nemesis with fewer hands at the ready.</string>
  <string id="94873" soundid="147495">I tell you, I begin to miss the melodious voice of my wife. So peaceful compared to what follows you around.</string>
  <string id="94874" soundid="147496">Sky&apos;s final fate is troubling, but I would not dare question your wisdom in the matter.</string>
  <string id="94875" soundid="147497">Our definitions of choice may differ in this matter, but it was your burden to deal with, and I would not have enjoyed sharing it.</string>
  <string id="94876" soundid="147498">I suppose all that matters is what is to come. It has been a rough road to get here, and tomorrow promises worse.</string>
  <string id="94877" soundid="147499">I have no wish to have my life ended the way his was. You will find me a most obedient servant.</string>
  <string id="94878" soundid="147500">Let philosophers argue the worth of fear or loyalty. I will follow whichever it pleases you to offer.</string>
  <string id="94879" soundid="147501">It is good to see Sky still with us, although I doubt he likes this form of servitude. Not that I question your judgment.</string>
  <string id="94880" soundid="147502">In my mind, it&apos;s preferable to the other options presented.</string>
  <string id="94881" soundid="147503">I don&apos;t have the insight to say whether his loyalty was reliable before his binding or not. Your decision was a difficult one.</string>
  <string id="94882" soundid="147504">I hope that eventually he will no longer need such... restraints.</string>
  <string id="94883" soundid="147505">Er, of course. I did not wish to anger you.</string>
  <string id="94884" soundid="147506">I look forward to the day when we can return to our simpler lives, although I doubt that will be easy for everyone.</string>
  <string id="94885" soundid="147507">Oh, it will be easy for me. I just cock an ear to the wind and listen. Eventually the shouts of my wife will make their way to me.</string>
  <string id="94886" soundid="147508">I hope everyone has so clear a path... and a more peaceful arrival.</string>
  <string id="94887" soundid="147509">That is a little troubling, but I trust your abilities. You have allowed us to survive so far.</string>
  <string id="94888" soundid="147510">I hope that trend continues.</string>
  <string id="94889" soundid="147511">While my duties don&apos;t seem to have changed much, I find this form of servitude even more degrading than the kind my gentle wife imposes.</string>
  <string id="94890" soundid="147512">I am not alone in my own head. My every move is echoed in my mind by your approving or disapproving guidance. </string>
  <string id="94891" soundid="147513">I appreciate your apology, but like my service, it seems a little forced under the circumstances.</string>
  <string id="94892" soundid="147514">If you don&apos;t mind, I must do what I can to get everyone ready for the coming fight. As you would have it.</string>
  <string id="94893" soundid="147515">I am beginning to recognize that. If there is nothing else, I must do what I can to ready everyone for the coming fight.</string>
  <string id="94894" soundid="147516">Just as you would have it.</string>
  <string id="94895" soundid="147517">The confrontation with Emperor Sun Li will come sooner than any of us would like, I&apos;m sure.</string>
  <string id="94896" soundid="147518">Well, I can&apos;t say my time with you has been boring. Dangerous, nerve-wracking, even exciting at times... but never boring.</string>
  <string id="94897" soundid="147519">You know, being here with you, I almost wish I was home with my wife instead. Almost.</string>
  <string id="94898" soundid="147520">That seemed a drastic way to help the Water Dragon. I hope it does the trick and weakens Li.</string>
  <string id="94899" soundid="147521">Amazing. You give me hope. If you can defy a dragon god, maybe I could defy my wife... just once.</string>
  <string id="94900" soundid="147522">I suppose we must continue now, though my instincts and my feet would seem to disagree.</string>
  <string id="94901" soundid="147523">Hmm, let me see. I&apos;m terrified... I&apos;m petrified... I think my pants need to be washed! What else would you like to know about me?</string>
  <string id="94902" soundid="147524">I&apos;m scared out of my wits, and I told you all the stories I have to tell. Perhaps we could resume this conversation later over some buns and tea.</string>
  <string id="94903" soundid="147525">Good, good. I&apos;ll go back to trying to look inconspicuous.</string>
  <string id="94904" soundid="147526">Your job isn&apos;t done, though. There are still more cannibals in the hill.</string>
  <string id="94905" soundid="147527">The hill heaved a short while ago and dislodged a panel in the kitchen wall. These creatures seemed to think it was a new way into the caves below.</string>
  <string id="94906" soundid="147528">If you truly want to finish this, you must deal with the Mother. The cannibals talked about her often. She&apos;s down there somewhere, corrupting everyone who gets close. </string>
  <string id="94907" soundid="147529">I now see the flaw in teaching you the style. I&apos;ll keep you supplied with wine if you keep those beasts away from me.</string>
  <string id="94908" soundid="147530">Well, it must be safer than this place! Good luck. You&apos;ll need it, I&apos;m afraid.</string>
  <string id="94909" soundid="147531">I don&apos;t know how to get in there, though.</string>
  <string id="94910" soundid="147532">The cannibals were dead set against that Forest Shadow. They didn&apos;t want anyone going near the temple. Maybe you could find her and get some answers.</string>
  <string id="94911" soundid="147533">Now, let&apos;s get out of here before the cannibals change their mind... or get hungry again.</string>
  <string id="94912" soundid="147534">Thanks to your deal with the Keeper, I&apos;m allowed to go free in your custody or company, as you see fit.</string>
  <string id="94913" soundid="147535">The name is Henpecked Hou, Master Bunmaker and long-suffering husband, at your service.</string>
  <string id="94914" soundid="147536">You may have sided with them, but at least you&apos;re human. It&apos;s a relief to be away from their hungry stares.</string>
  <string id="94915" soundid="147537">Why not, you already abandoned the forest to them.</string>
  <string id="94916" soundid="147538">No, that was unfair. You did what you did for a reason, and I&apos;m alive because of it.</string>
  <string id="94917" soundid="147539">I&apos;m just glad to be alive, and I have you to thank for that. Those beasts wouldn&apos;t have let me go otherwise.</string>
  <string id="94918" soundid="147540">You should meet my wife. You two would get along.</string>
  <string id="94919" soundid="147541">That was astonishing! I haven&apos;t seen such martial skills in an eatery since the last time I added ginger to my wife&apos;s hot and sour soup!</string>
  <string id="94920" soundid="147542">I kept hoping you would come over and talk to me so I could try and tip you off. It seems you didn&apos;t need my help at all.</string>
  <string id="94921" soundid="147543">Thank you for your great kindness in rescuing me. Now that these beasts are dead, I can finally talk to you.</string>
  <string id="94922" soundid="147544">My name is Henpecked Hou, and before you ask, I&apos;m not one of those monsters. They kept me prisoner so that I could &quot;seem normal&quot; to the customers.</string>
  <string id="94923" soundid="147545">No sense dancing around it. You might as well have asked.</string>
  <string id="94924" soundid="147546">My wife is...unique. To say that she is as enduring as the Wall itself is to do a disservice to her persistence.</string>
  <string id="94925" soundid="147547">I could make similar comparisons between the force of her will and the Imperial Army, but I think you have the picture.</string>
  <string id="94926" soundid="147548">You have *no* idea what you&apos;re suggesting.</string>
  <string id="94927" soundid="147549">The last I saw of her, she was in the Imperial City. I was due back more than a week ago, and if she hasn&apos;t torn the place down looking for me, I&apos;ll be surprised.</string>
  <string id="94932">Come with me now. I want to try Drunken Master some more.</string>
  <string id="94934">I&apos;ve cleared a path through the forest. Go to Tien&apos;s Landing.</string>
  <string id="94939">Come with me, I&apos;d rather not abandon you to those cannibals.</string>
  <string id="94942">We&apos;ll drop you off in Tien&apos;s Landing.</string>
  <string id="94944">If you can find a way to be useful, I&apos;ll let you live.</string>
  <string id="94949">Pleased to meet...wait, did you just say &quot;Henpecked?&quot;</string>
  <string id="94950">Er...I&apos;m &lt;FullName&gt;.</string>
  <string id="94953">Why don&apos;t you just leave her?</string>
  <string id="94955">Where is she now?</string>
  <string id="94958">I certainly didn&apos;t mean to rescue you.</string>
  <string id="94960">There are caves below this inn?</string>
  <string id="94961">The Forest Shadow told me there were caves below this inn.</string>
  <string id="94962">What do you know about this Mother?</string>
  <string id="94965">How do they reach the caves below?</string>
  <string id="94966">What is in the caves?</string>
  <string id="94967" soundid="163698">It isn&apos;t fair. If only my father were still alive... he&apos;d know what to do.</string>
  <string id="94968">That&apos;s enough about the caves.</string>
  <string id="94969">What were your captors?</string>
  <string id="94970">How did they disguise themselves?</string>
  <string id="94972">Why did they keep you around?</string>
  <string id="94974">Where do they come from?</string>
  <string id="94976">We should discuss something else</string>
  <string id="94977">Why did they keep you around? What were they planning?</string>
  <string id="94980">Tell me about the caves.</string>
  <string id="94981">I know all I want to know about these cannibals.</string>
  <string id="94988">Of course, but I&apos;ve never seen the style.</string>
  <string id="94989">No. What is it?</string>
  <string id="94991">So you can fight alongside me? Perfect.</string>
  <string id="94993">Can you teach me Drunken Master?</string>
  <string id="94996">Teach me how to use Drunken Master. </string>
  <string id="94997">I hope you&apos;re not wasting my time.</string>
  <string id="95001">You&apos;re not one of them?</string>
  <string id="95002">Who are you?</string>
  <string id="95007">There&apos;s something very strange here. What are you hinting at?</string>
  <string id="95008">[Charm] Your clues were very clever, perhaps just one more?</string>

  <string id="95018">I suppose that is a bit odd.</string>
  <string id="95019">Are you going to show them to me or not?</string>
  <string id="95021">Can I ask you some questions about the forest?</string>
  <string id="95023">You just arrived and you&apos;re already keeping shop here at the inn?</string>
  <string id="95025">Just tell me what you know.</string>
  <string id="95026">Maybe I should just ask someone else.</string>
  <string id="95027">Do you know anything about the Forest Shadow?</string>
  <string id="95029">It doesn&apos;t look as though this place has had any problems.</string>
  <string id="95031">She attacked me. I&apos;m inclined to agree with them.</string>
  <string id="95033">I should let you go.</string>
  <string id="95034">I guess you don&apos;t much like your job.</string>
  <string id="95036">I&apos;m not here to make your life easy.</string>
  <string id="95039">I&apos;m sorry to hear that, Hou.</string>
  <string id="95040">I thought you&apos;d be happy.</string>
  <string id="95041">I need to ask you some questions.</string>
  <string id="95048">Why did you become a bun master if you were a master fighter?</string>
  <string id="95051">Well, that&apos;s not such a bad thing.</string>
  <string id="95052">And so you became a bun master?</string>
  <string id="95053">Hou! You need to learn to stand up for yourself.</string>
  <string id="95055">Ouch!</string>
  <string id="95056">Well, I guess you survived.</string>
  <string id="95057">Poor Hou. You&apos;re whipped, my friend!</string>
  <string id="95058">What are your thoughts, demon?</string>
  <string id="95059">What are your thoughts, guardian?</string>
  <string id="95060" soundid="166610">Please, we shouldn&apos;t waste time after coming so far. We need to go back to the palace and find Master Li.</string>
  <string id="95061" soundid="166612">I realize you&apos;re the one with the brains, but shouldn&apos;t we be back to the palace? I had a feeling that was important somehow.</string>
  <string id="95062">Convince Zhong</string>
  <string id="95065">You convinced Zhong the Ox Carrier to leave with Dong Ping. The ogre will no longer worry the patrons in the teahouse.</string>

  <string id="95366" soundid="147988">I... I don&apos;t really know what to say... I don&apos;t really do much. I just go where the Guardian tells me to go. Where we&apos;re needed. I trust him. He won&apos;t let them hurt me.</string>
  <string id="95367" soundid="147989">The evil men, the bad ones, and... the Other. But he says not to worry, that none of them are here now, but they follow you, which is why we&apos;ve come.</string>
  <string id="95368" soundid="147990">I... I don&apos;t know. He&apos;s always been there, inside me. Together. I follow him wherever he takes me. Wherever we&apos;re needed.</string>
  <string id="95369" soundid="147991">Now we&apos;re needed here, with you. You&apos;re the last, he says, so we have to protect you, to make sure balance is restored. You hold the amulet and can use it, unlike....</string>
  <string id="95370" soundid="147992">Oh! He says I&apos;ve already said too much. He doesn&apos;t like me talking about him while he&apos;s busy. Maybe... maybe we can talk again sometime? But for now... not about that.</string>
  <string id="95371" soundid="147993">The Guardian wouldn&apos;t like me talking about that. He&apos;s... busy now. The Other is... hurting, and he&apos;s keeping him inside. All the evil that has been done makes him stronger.</string>
  <string id="95372" soundid="147994">I... I shouldn&apos;t say. Just by naming him... thinking of him, it draws him closer to the surface... gives him more power.</string>
  <string id="95373" soundid="147995">The Guardian said that in all things there is balance, and for light there is dark within each of us. The Other is his darkness, for the good he has to do. That&apos;s what he says.</string>
  <string id="95374" soundid="147996">I... I can&apos;t talk about him. Already he hears me, and the Guardian is having trouble keeping him back. Please... don&apos;t mention him again.</string>
  <string id="95375" soundid="147997">The Guardian is here because of you and the amulet you hold. He is here because there is a debt to be paid. But balance must always be maintained, and so... the Other.</string>
  <string id="95376" soundid="147998">The Guardian is... my friend. He is a part of me. But the Other... he is a part of me, too. Sometimes they pull so hard in different ways, it... I can&apos;t.... [crying]</string>
  <string id="95377" soundid="147999">I... [sniff] I try to be strong, and the Guardian gives me hope. But... sometimes it&apos;s all I can do to convince me I&apos;m still myself. Will... will you stay with me, and keep me in myself?</string>
  <string id="95378" soundid="148000">Th... thank you. [sniff] I&apos;ll try not to be a bother, but the Guardian says we must stay with you. I hope you&apos;ll be my friend.</string>
  <string id="95379" soundid="148001">[sniff] I understand. I&apos;ll try not to be a burden, but the Guardian... he says we have to stay. So I will.</string>
  <string id="95380" soundid="148002">Okay.</string>
  <string id="95381" soundid="148003"></string>
  <string id="95382" soundid="148004">What do you want?</string>
  <string id="95383" soundid="148005">This place is evil. I don&apos;t like it here. The people... they&apos;re hurting, too. A black cloud hangs over this place. Please... don&apos;t leave me behind here... not alone.</string>
  <string id="95384" soundid="148006">Is there anything else you want?</string>
  <string id="95385" soundid="148007">That strong lady... she&apos;s the princess? I... I didn&apos;t know that women could be that strong. We&apos;re always supposed to be weak and left behind.</string>
  <string id="95386" soundid="148008">But there&apos;s you... you&apos;re strong! And a lady as well! I think you two should get along and be friends. We should meet her again.</string>
  <string id="95387" soundid="148009">Chai Ka: You are not weak, Wild Flower. You are as strong as any woman I have ever known. Trust in yourself. And you, mortal, treat her tenderly.</string>
  <string id="95388" soundid="148010">I don&apos;t like what we have to do. Aren&apos;t the Lotus Assassins evil? Why should we try to imitate them?</string>
  <string id="95389" soundid="148011">Chai Ka: To find the heart of evil, you must look within your own. A noble heart can resist any temptations. Do not stray from this path.</string>
  <string id="95390" soundid="148012">I know that I won&apos;t, and that being around Lotus Assassins won&apos;t corrupt me, as long as I have the Guardian... and you.</string>
  <string id="95391" soundid="148013">Now you&apos;re... you&apos;re one of them, aren&apos;t you? But not really, right? We have to find them so we can stop them. I know you can do it!</string>
  <string id="95392" soundid="148014">All the people whisper in fear about them, but you stand up and fight back. But the princess said you&apos;ll have to get inside their fortress to find them.</string>
  <string id="95393" soundid="148015">Chai Ka: The fortress of the Lotus Assassins... hidden among the graves of the Necropolis. A fitting place for their corruption.</string>
  <string id="95394" soundid="148016">This... this place isn&apos;t good. I feel like the Other is pushing on the back of my mind, trying to escape.</string>
  <string id="95395" soundid="148017">You should never have called him out... you shouldn&apos;t use him at all. He&apos;s like... pain... in my head.</string>
  <string id="95396" soundid="148018">Ya Zhen: But sometimes pain is useful... and feels so good. You must reach the highest levels of these Assassins to get what you want. Don&apos;t limit yourself with petty morals.</string>
  <string id="95397" soundid="148019">He hurts... Please don&apos;t call him again.</string>
  <string id="95398" soundid="148020">Chai Ka: Hush, child. I won&apos;t let him harm you. But this place... The evil here brings him closer to the surface. You must pass through here, but not at the expense of your soul.</string>
  <string id="95399" soundid="148021">Chai Ka: Do what is necessary. Find what you seek, but do not delay here, or it could cost the girl dearly.</string>
  <string id="95400" soundid="148022">The Guardian... he helps me sometimes, when the pain is bad. He makes me feel better.</string>
  <string id="95401" soundid="148023">We&apos;re going to see the Emperor aren&apos;t we? That&apos;s what she said, right? I always wanted to see the Emperor. But... we&apos;re just going to talk to him, right?</string>
  <string id="95402" soundid="148024">The Emperor is a part of heaven isn&apos;t he? Close to the gods... No one like that could ever do evil.</string>
  <string id="95403" soundid="148025">Chai Ka: Your innocence shields you, child, but not everyone, no matter how exalted their station, is pure. Evil can find its way into the heart of any man... or woman.</string>
  <string id="95404" soundid="148026">Ya Zhen: Ha! What does this little automaton know about what&apos;s really inside people? I&apos;m the true inner self, stripped of all delusions and pretensions. Keep that in mind.</string>
  <string id="95405" soundid="148027">I... I don&apos;t know. You must go to see the Emperor, and I know the Guardian wants to help you, so... I do to. You&apos;ve done so much for me, and I&apos;ll do anything to repay you.</string>
  <string id="95406" soundid="148028">They don&apos;t come out very much. The Guardian protects me and keeps the... the Other inside. When the Other tries to get out, it feels like my head is going to tear itself apart.</string>
  <string id="95407" soundid="148029">Yes... But the Guardian has always been with me, and I trust him. The other one has been there too, but... smaller. They won&apos;t say why.... They say we have to be with you now.</string>
  <string id="95408" soundid="148030">I... I don&apos;t know. The Guardian... he&apos;s always been with me. The other one, too. But they never really tell me why.... They say we have to be with you now.</string>
  <string id="95409" soundid="148031">Chai Ka: Hush, child. I will speak for now. This child has been chosen as the vessel to allow me into the mortal realm. She is my gate into this world, and I am her protector.</string>
  <string id="95410" soundid="148032">Chai Ka: The amulet you carry had been hidden in the village by the last of the Spirit Monks and the whole area flooded. Those remaining behind died and it was lost forever.</string>
  <string id="95411" soundid="148033">Chai Ka: But the dam had opened again and the water receded. I am bound to protect this amulet, but to exist in this world, balance is needed. With good, evil. With life, death.</string>
  <string id="95412" soundid="148034">Chai Ka: Of those who died there, I chose this one as my host. She was reborn through my power, and I within her. But balance required that my heavenly presence have an opposite.</string>
  <string id="95413" soundid="148035">Chai Ka: Yes. He is within this child as well. He cares nothing for the amulet or the girl. He would break them all to pieces just to have his chance at freedom.</string>
  <string id="95414" soundid="148036">Ya Zhen: Ha! You care too much for this whelp.</string>
  <string id="95415" soundid="148037">Chai Ka: Quiet! Stay inside. Do not mention these things to Wild Flower, Spirit Monk. She is only dimly aware of her past, and this knowledge would harm her further.</string>
  <string id="95416" soundid="148038">Chai Ka: We needed a host, and she was there. I did not expect balance to require that both I and Ya Zhen be within her. It is almost too much for her to bear.</string>
  <string id="95417" soundid="148039">Chai Ka: We are both here inside her, but Ya Zhen is different. He cares nothing for the amulet or the girl and would gladly sacrifice her to escape.</string>
  <string id="95418" soundid="148040">Chai Ka: No... I will not permit him to be free now. He damages this child, and since I was the one who chose her, I bear the responsibility of it. As to why it was her...</string>
  <string id="95419" soundid="148041">I... I can&apos;t call them out right now. I... I don&apos;t think it would be safe. They are fighting again... inside.</string>
  <string id="95420" soundid="148042">I... I... Ahhh!</string>
  <string id="95421" soundid="148043">Ya Zhen: It&apos;s time you and I had a talk, mortal. You&apos;ve been paying too much attention to this girl&apos;s problems and the &quot;Guardian&apos;s&quot; advice. We need more realism here.</string>
  <string id="95422" soundid="148044">Ya Zhen: You know I&apos;m evil and want to kill everything. I know I&apos;m evil and want to kill everything. Why quibble about details? You help me, and I help you. And I want out.</string>
  <string id="95423" soundid="148045">Ya Zhen: The girl is already dead. She&apos;s a walking corpse. She&apos;s nothing to anyone. What I want is the body. I need an anchor, and this little walking meat puppet can provide that.</string>
  <string id="95424" soundid="148046">Ya Zhen: But Chai Ka gives me trouble. He&apos;s in my way. He&apos;s weak, but the girl sides with him. To take control, I need your help. And I&apos;m willing to offer servitude for it.
</string>
  <string id="95425" soundid="148047">Ya Zhen: Ha! You say that now, but when the time comes, we&apos;ll see how much power tempts you. And if you continue to refuse, I still have ways to get my revenge.</string>
  <string id="95426" soundid="148048">Chai Ka: Back into the darkness, Ya Zhen! You tricked me so I wouldn&apos;t hear you talking, but no more! Spirit Monk, it is unwise to speak with him. He knows only lies and deceit.</string>
  <string id="95427" soundid="148049">Chai Ka: For the sake of the child, have no further dealings with him. He is stronger now; he might be able to force his way out, or be called. Resist him. Do not listen to him.</string>
  <string id="95428" soundid="148050">Ya Zhen: Why not? How long do you live, anyway? I&apos;m immortal! I have forever to get what I want. A few decades doing odd jobs for you would be worth it for my freedom.</string>
  <string id="95429" soundid="148051">Ya Zhen: I knew you&apos;d see it my way. The time is not right, now. Soon, though, I&apos;ll have my chance, and then you&apos;ll know what it&apos;s like to have a *real* demon for an ally.</string>
  <string id="95430" soundid="148052">Okay.</string>
  <string id="95431" soundid="148053">Th... there is something here. Some evil thing has happened here. It beats on my mind, and the Guardian... he... can&apos;t... hold it back.</string>
  <string id="95432" soundid="148054">Chai Ka: No! I won&apos;t let you do this! Not now!</string>
  <string id="95433" soundid="148055">Ya Zhen: rrrrRRRRRAAAAAGH!</string>
  <string id="95434" soundid="148056">Ya Zhen: You can&apos;t stop me from being here. I may not be able to leave, but I can talk... and see. I see you mortal. I&apos;ve been watching you.</string>
  <string id="95435" soundid="148057">Ya Zhen: Ha! I am Ya Zhen, the Other of whom Chai Ka and this girl speak. They have suppressed me ever since we inhabited this body. But this place is different.</string>
  <string id="95436" soundid="148058">Ya Zhen: The evil around me has given me strength--for now, at least--and has opened potential doors.</string>
  <string id="95437" soundid="148059">Ya Zhen: I don&apos;t claim to goodness, mortal. I hate your kind, but we can work together. If you help me, I shall help you, and I&apos;ll be much more valuable than &quot;the Guardian.&quot;</string>
  <string id="95438" soundid="148060">Ya Zhen: Bah! Who cares about her? She&apos;s just another insect. This is about what I can offer you. When the time comes... what? No! Chai Ka, you won&apos;t make me go... no!</string>
  <string id="95439" soundid="148061">Chai Ka: You stay below, Ya Zhen! You won&apos;t harm this girl or this world! And you, Spirit Monk... avoid him. For the sake of this girl, don&apos;t let him out.</string>
  <string id="95440" soundid="148062"></string>
  <string id="95441" soundid="148063">I... I&apos;m sorry. They were... fighting again. I&apos;ll be all right... soon. Just... just give me time and I&apos;ll be all right.</string>
  <string id="95442" soundid="148064">Ya Zhen: You&apos;re passing up the chance for greatness, mortal. We both know you&apos;re tempted. How can you... What? No! Chai Ka, you won&apos;t make me go so easily. No!</string>
  <string id="95443" soundid="148065">Ya Zhen: Good. Good. All we need to discuss are the details. I find this prison restricting, and as soon as I can... What? No! Chai Ka, you won&apos;t make me go so easily... No!</string>
  <string id="95444" soundid="148066"></string>
  <string id="95445" soundid="148067">Ya Zhen: The time has come, mortal. I won&apos;t share this shell anymore! I&apos;ll destroy you, Chai Ka, and her mind, as well, if I have to!</string>
  <string id="95446" soundid="148068">Chai Ka: He... He is too strong here, in this place! You must help me, Spirit Monk! For the sake of the girl, fight with me against him!</string>
  <string id="95447" soundid="148069">Chai Ka: Then come, we must face him inside the girl&apos;s spirit.</string>
  <string id="95448" soundid="148070"></string>
  <string id="95451" soundid="148073">Ya Zhen: Ha! I knew you&apos;d see it my way. Come into what&apos;s left of this wretch&apos;s spirit and give me my freedom!</string>
  <string id="95452" soundid="148074"></string>
  <string id="95453" soundid="158326">Quickly, there&apos;s no time to stop and talk. We must escape this place before it becomes our tomb.</string>
  <string id="95454" soundid="158327">There&apos;s no time for discussion. We must confront Jia and get out of here.</string>
  <string id="95455" soundid="150882">Thank you for what you have done here. Ya Zhen has not been banished, but his strength has been greatly depleted. He will not harm the girl again.</string>
  <string id="95456" soundid="150883">She will not know what happened here, only that it was important, that the darkness is gone, and that you are to thank for it.</string>
  <string id="95458" soundid="150885"></string>
  <string id="95459" soundid="150886">Free at last! Now this pitiful girl will feel agony for resisting me for so long! And you... with this girl&apos;s mind as the offering, I bow to you... my master.</string>
  <string id="95460" soundid="160286">The Mother, the demon they serve, is now strong enough to send her minions to attack us directly, breaching the sanctity of this place with her magic.</string>
  <string id="95462" soundid="148084">Ooooh....</string>
  <string id="95463">Imperial Guard</string>
  <string id="95464" soundid="148086"></string>
  <string id="95465" soundid="148087">I... No!.. I... [gasp]</string>
  <string id="95466" soundid="148088">Ya Zhen: Find the Emperor. Face him. No matter what his daughter says, you can do what you want. What&apos;s the point of having a will if you do not enforce it?</string>
  <string id="95467" soundid="148089">Ya Zhen: I am at your disposal, of course.</string>
  <string id="95468" soundid="148090">What would you like?</string>
  <string id="95469" soundid="148091">This palace, it&apos;s... wondrous! I never thought a place like this could exist! But the Guardian... he says that something is wrong... it&apos;s not right.</string>
  <string id="95470" soundid="148092">Chai Ka: This place is steeped in magic. The very stones burn with it, but... there is corruption, too. At the heart lies something outside the bounds of nature.</string>
  <string id="95471" soundid="148093">Chai Ka: Whatever fate guides us, it surely leads us here.</string>
  <string id="95472" soundid="148094">Okay.</string>
  <string id="95473" soundid="148095"></string>
  <string id="95474" soundid="148096"></string>
  <string id="95475" soundid="148097">Hello again. Do you want to talk to me or the Guardian?</string>
  <string id="95476" soundid="148098">I&apos;m... I&apos;m better now, thanks to you. You put the Other back down in a place where he can&apos;t hurt me anymore. You&apos;ve done as much for me as the Guardian, and....</string>
  <string id="95477" soundid="148099">And I&apos;ll never forget it. No matter what. If things here... if they turn out well, I hope, someday, when I&apos;m older... we could meet and... be friends again.</string>
  <string id="95478" soundid="148100">I know that to stand by you, it won&apos;t be me, it&apos;ll be the Guardian, but my hopes go with him.</string>
  <string id="95479" soundid="148101">Chai Ka: I harbor a great sadness over the fate of Sky. It was your right to decide how he should be punished, but that does not make it any less unfortunate.</string>
  <string id="95480" soundid="148102">Chai Ka: I am glad you chose to show mercy to Sky, although the whole situation is still very unfortunate. Many have been troubled by these events.</string>
  <string id="95481" soundid="148103">Chai Ka: The presence of Death&apos;s Hand is not welcome, but it is your choice. The continued torment of the soul removed from him is troubling.</string>
  <string id="95482" soundid="148104">Chai Ka: You have dealt with dissension in the manner you saw fit. I will not pass judgment, for your task ahead is too important to risk on such disagreements.</string>
  <string id="95483" soundid="148105">Chai Ka: You lead as you must. I will serve the will of the heavens and follow in your steps.</string>
  <string id="95484" soundid="148106">Chai Ka: I do not. You have suffered enough interference from my kind and many others.</string>
  <string id="95485" soundid="148107">Chai Ka: You would be better served listening to the wisdom of the child within: Do what you must, but be happy.</string>
  <string id="95486" soundid="148108">The Guardian says he&apos;ll be at your side when you need him.</string>
  <string id="95487" soundid="148109"></string>
  <string id="95488" soundid="148110">Ahh! No... no! I... [shriek]</string>
  <string id="95489" soundid="148111">Ya Zhen: What do you want? I owe you a great deal for freeing me. This body should serve well... as long as it lasts.</string>
  <string id="95490" soundid="148112">Ya Zhen: Your mortal fates are such interesting things. Such amusing toys. But if you get what you seek here, and your ambition is realized... remember a faithful servant.</string>
  <string id="95491" soundid="148113">Ya Zhen: Ha! And if you fail... well, then I&apos;ll have your soul to toy with, anyway, as with this girl.</string>
  <string id="95492" soundid="148114">Ya Zhen: So sad that Sky was killed, but so appropriate. I could feel his anguish, his self-loathing. His spirit will stew for ages over that.</string>
  <string id="95493" soundid="148115">Ya Zhen: Sky should have been killed. If he had died at the peak of his anguish, his spirit would have stewed in torment for ages.</string>
  <string id="95494" soundid="148116">Ya Zhen: Death&apos;s Hand is an interesting acquisition. I look into him and see a void where Kin should be. It&apos;s like staring into an abyss.</string>
  <string id="95495" soundid="148117">Ya Zhen: Those who don&apos;t agree with your wisdom should be punished. You are more merciful than I would be, though this body is too weak to enforce proper... mercy.</string>
  <string id="95496" soundid="148118">Ya Zhen: Things go the way you want them to. It&apos;s not up to me to pass final judgment on your effectiveness.</string>
  <string id="95497" soundid="148119">Ya Zhen: I hope things are fairly clear to you by now. Either you or your master will fall.</string>
  <string id="95498" soundid="148120">Ya Zhen: I recommend that you not let it be you.</string>
  <string id="95499" soundid="148121">Ya Zhen: I&apos;ll be ready. Just be sure that you are.</string>
  <string id="95500" soundid="148122">Ya Zhen: What is it now? Hurry with your preparations so we can move on to more... interesting things.</string>
  <string id="95501" soundid="148123">I sense something strange about this girl. She is more than she appears.</string>
  <string id="95502" soundid="148124">Well, this is certainly odd. I&apos;m guessing there&apos;s more here than meets the eye.</string>
  <string id="95503" soundid="148125">The Guardian is coming. He&apos;s very mad. He got mad at this man and hurt him. You better go away right now, or he&apos;ll get mad at you, too.</string>
  <string id="95504" soundid="148126">I don&apos;t matter. Only the Guardian matters. He&apos;s going to be very cross with you. You should run before he gets here.</string>
  <string id="95505" soundid="148127">He made the Guardian mad. The Guardian hurt him. He&apos;ll hurt you, too. You should run away.</string>
  <string id="95506" soundid="148128">[Sigh] It&apos;s too late. I told you to run away, but you didn&apos;t listen. Now the Guardian&apos;s here, and he&apos;s going to hurt you. He&apos;s really mad.</string>
  <string id="95507" soundid="148129"></string>
  <string id="95508" soundid="148130">The Guardian wants me to give you this. That man over there had it. It&apos;s an Inscrutable Power Source. The Guardian says you might need it.</string>
  <string id="95509" soundid="148131">The Guardian doesn&apos;t know what it&apos;s for, but he knows it&apos;s important. Otherwise, why would that man have had it? You better keep it for now.</string>
  <string id="95510" soundid="148132">The Guardian says we don&apos;t have to stay here anymore. He says we have to go with you now. Is that right?</string>
  <string id="95511" soundid="148133">Good. I like you. The Guardian likes you, too.</string>
  <string id="95513">She is dead.</string>

  <string id="95742" soundid="148364">I... I&apos;m sorry, but I can&apos;t let you pass. Please, Princess! There are Lotus Assassins throughout the tunnels with orders to attack all who enter.</string>

  <string id="95748" soundid="148370">I must hear it from my father&apos;s mouth. I must hear how he explains all these lies, the golems, Death&apos;s Hand... all of it.</string>
  <string id="95749" soundid="148371">I am restricted within my own home. The arrogance of what Death&apos;s Hand has done knows no bounds. Regardless, this path will still be the least fortified.</string>
  <string id="95750" soundid="148372">You go ahead, but only take one other with you. The rest should guard the rear and only fight if needed. I do not want a full war within these sacred walls.</string>

  <string id="95752" soundid="148374">This man was more concerned with my safety than keeping me out. No alarms have been raised. We are still secure.</string>
  <string id="95753" soundid="148375">We must reach the throne room unopposed. He will wake in a few hours. Shall we go? Our meeting with my father can&apos;t come soon enough.</string>
  <string id="95754" soundid="148376">This is one of the many spires within the palace, where visitors are raised as if by the glory of the Empire. Without a guide, you could be lost here for days.</string>
  <string id="95755" soundid="163080"></string>
  <string id="95756" soundid="163081">I wish we could have visited the palace under better circumstances. I feel like an invader in the heart of my own land. Let&apos;s keep moving.</string>
  <string id="95764" soundid="148386">We are nearly to the throne room, although my father has let these unseen parts of the palace fall into disrepair. These chambers are the tombs of past leaders.</string>
  <string id="95765" soundid="148387">The latest tombs belong to the Emperor&apos;s brothers, Prince Sun Li and Prince Sun Kin. You have caused me to doubt this, but here they are for your own eyes to see.</string>
  <string id="95766" soundid="148388">These are the tombs of the Emperor&apos;s brothers. Of Prince Sun Li the Glorious Strategist and Prince Sun Kin the Hand of Heaven.</string>
  <string id="95767" soundid="148389">That is what you said he told you, but here is the tomb of the Glorious Strategist before you. Is this all a lie?</string>
  <string id="95768" soundid="148390">No... they have been sealed for twenty years. I don&apos;t have any more proof than what was announced to the people.</string>
  <string id="95769" soundid="148391">I don&apos;t know what that is worth anymore.</string>
  <string id="95770" soundid="148392">And your next question will be, &quot;What is in there if the brothers aren&apos;t?&quot; I can&apos;t say, but my father will explain everything. He has to.</string>
  <string id="95771" soundid="148393">But... your conviction is disturbing. I will definitely bring this up with my father when we confront him.</string>
  <string id="95772" soundid="148394">We are close to the throne room. The longer we take, the more questions I have.</string>
  <string id="95773" soundid="148395">I... don&apos;t know what to believe. I have to get to my father and let him explain.</string>
  <string id="95774" soundid="148396">Why would you say that?</string>
  <string id="95775" soundid="148397">That... that can&apos;t be possible, can it? Prince Sun Li was killed twenty years ago, along with Prince Kin. Your master was lying... or perhaps testing you.</string>
  <string id="95776" soundid="148398">Besides, you wouldn&apos;t want it to be true. Palace records say the Glorious Strategist was killed after trying to overthrow the Emperor.</string>
  <string id="95777" soundid="148399">The people were told that he and Prince Kin, the third brother, were killed defending the empire. Perhaps they fought each other, or were both traitors?</string>
  <string id="95778" soundid="148400">Perhaps Death&apos;s Hand tried to influence your master before my father, but now you&apos;ve called my father into doubt. I don&apos;t know what is true anymore.</string>
  <string id="95779" soundid="148401">No, they have been sealed since my father announced that they died. That was just after Death&apos;s Hand became his right hand.</string>
  <string id="95780" soundid="148402">I&apos;d always thought Death&apos;s Hand had a role in their deaths. Now I don&apos;t know what to think.</string>
  <string id="95781" soundid="148403">Of course not! It&apos;s been twenty years since they were entombed. Why would you even ask something like that?</string>
  <string id="95782" soundid="148404">The latest are the tombs of two men who were greatly mourned. The Emperor&apos;s brothers, Prince Sun Li the Glorious Strategist and Prince Sun Kin the Hand of Heaven.</string>
  <string id="95783" soundid="148405">You should have an interest. These tombs are proof against a foolish notion that you had some time ago.</string>
  <string id="95784" soundid="148406">You dismiss too quickly. These men were greatly mourned by all: the Emperor&apos;s brothers, Prince Sun Li the Glorious Strategist and Prince Sun Kin the Hand of Heaven.</string>
  <string id="95785" soundid="148407">Here it is... the entrance to my father&apos;s throne room. I doubt he&apos;ll take this intrusion kindly. Especially not with... with the information we&apos;ve learned.</string>
  <string id="95786" soundid="148408">I... I don&apos;t know what my father has done, or what his reaction will be, but I want you to know something.</string>
  <string id="95787" soundid="148409">I care for you, and I want to explore what we mean to each other in more... intimate surroundings.</string>
  <string id="95788" soundid="148410">We have to face my father, but afterwards we must sort out this mess you have created... this confusing tangle of hearts you keep at your beck and call.</string>
  <string id="95789" soundid="148411">I agree. If I am in your heart, say so. I will not be a secondary plaything of yours.</string>
  <string id="95790" soundid="148412">So perceptive, and such a skillful tongue.</string>
  <string id="95791" soundid="148413">You are a vulgar woman, Princess.</string>
  <string id="95792" soundid="148414">And you lie to yourself about it, but that is a topic for another day. The Emperor awaits.</string>
  <string id="95793" soundid="148415">I see. Such an abrupt end to a skillfully manipulated affair.</string>
  <string id="95794" soundid="148416">I don&apos;t understand, but I know I won&apos;t put up with this. Let&apos;s do what we must against this Emperor and get out of here.</string>
  <string id="95795" soundid="148417">We have to face my father and find out what has happened... what he has done. If we still can, afterwards, let&apos;s find what we truly mean to each other.</string>
  <string id="95796" soundid="148418">I think there will be some new rules put in place, ones that allow princesses to see whom they wish. Now, to the Emperor.</string>
  <string id="95797" soundid="148419">If you are lucky, I&apos;ll use them to bind *you.* Enough of this for now. The Emperor awaits.</string>
  <string id="95798" soundid="148420">Ahh... I longed for you to say that, and I will hold you to it. Now, to the Emperor and your master.</string>
  <string id="95799" soundid="148421">Hmm, that&apos;s right, you don&apos;t. Now let&apos;s get this over with so we can return to more pleasurable tasks. The Emperor awaits.</string>
  <string id="95800" soundid="148422">I... I&apos;ve never cared for someone like this before. Not for any man... or woman for that matter.</string>
  <string id="95801" soundid="148423">Then this is it. This is what you were meant to do... to face the Emperor in the heart of the Empire. All our hard work... Sagacious Zu&apos;s sacrifice....</string>
  <string id="95802" soundid="148424">After all of this, all I can think about is how much more there is to be said between us.</string>
  <string id="95803" soundid="148425">I... I have come to rely on that. Please, no matter what happens beyond these doors, do not forget who you are.</string>
  <string id="95804" soundid="148426">Destiny has a way of changing the rules. We have come this far... I could not bear to lose you.</string>
  <string id="95805" soundid="148427">Destiny has a way of changing the rules. After all of this... I would never forgive you if I were to lose you.</string>
  <string id="95806" soundid="148428">I understand. Instead of words, a promise for tomorrow.</string>
  <string id="95807" soundid="148429">Strange that you turn into a poet now after showing me your darker side. We will live because I would never forgive you if I lost you now.</string>
  <string id="95808" soundid="148430">I see. I am sorry I distracted you. Just know that... my thoughts go with you, even if yours are not with me.</string>

Despite the loss of the Master she thought she knew, with the restoration of the natural order the Empire seemed alive with possibility. She had seen the heart of the land in turmoil, so she retraced her steps, replacing memories of destruction with sights of renewal. Soon she found herself back in the ruin of Two Rivers. It was painful, but she took comfort in knowing that the fish were abundant and the land remained fertile; eventually new settlers would come. She replanted her garden, a flower for each of her lost friends, and set out across the Empire once more.</string>

  <string id="95880">Who is entombed here?</string>
  <string id="95881" soundid="162488">There was a time when I might have disagreed with such a ploy, but that was before you showed me how to stand up to this world.</string>
  <string id="95882">Master Li is the Emperor&apos;s brother and he is alive.</string>
  <string id="95883">Have you actually seen inside the tombs?</string>
  <string id="95885">If Master Li is alive, what about Prince Kin?</string>
  <string id="95888">Let&apos;s get going.</string>
  <string id="95889">Why shouldn&apos;t I? Your father&apos;s word is hardly worth more.</string>
  <string id="95890">This can&apos;t be the tomb of the Glorious Strategist.</string>
  <string id="95891">Master Li is the Glorious Strategist. He told me so.</string>
  <string id="95895">His word is hardly worth more than my master&apos;s.</string>
  <string id="95896">It doesn&apos;t matter. Have you seen inside the tombs yourself?</string>
  <string id="95899">Bah! I told you already that Master Li is the Glorious Strategist.</string>
  <string id="95900">That&apos;s impossible. You must have been lied to.</string>
  <string id="95901">Are you certain of this? Have you seen the bodies?</string>
  <string id="95902" soundid="162489">Whoever Master Li is now, he is not the father I never had. If he deserved that role, he would have recognized me. He abandoned me by never searching.</string>
  <string id="95903">I have no interest. We should get moving.</string>
  <string id="95905" soundid="162490">I am more concerned with... with what I have now. Sometimes I wonder what I would do if I lost you.</string>
  <string id="95910">You are second to none, Dawn Star.</string>
  <string id="95911">You both feign annoyance to hide your intrigue. We will discuss it after we deal with the Emperor.</string>
  <string id="95915">This is neither the time, nor the place! Both of you shut up!</string>
  <string id="95918">And what of the court? What of the rules that bind you?</string>
  <string id="95921">I&apos;ll stand by you, my Heavenly Lily.</string>
  <string id="95923">I want no one else, my Silk Fox.</string>
  <string id="95927">I won&apos;t wait. You have my love, Dawn Star.</string>
  <string id="95931">Be silent, my Dawn Star. If it *must* be said, then we are sure to live until it is.</string>
  <string id="95934">And now is not the time. Let me concentrate.</string>
  <string id="95937">I&apos;m ready. Let&apos;s go.</string>
  <string id="95939">I have some words for your father, too.</string>
  <string id="95941">Now, now. Temper.</string>
  <string id="95942">Such fire... why couldn&apos;t you have been like this two nights ago?</string>
  <string id="95943">I have merely removed the guesswork.</string>
  <string id="95944">But so amusing. We will work on your performance later.</string>
  <string id="95945">Goodbye for now.</string>
  <string id="95946">Enough of your chatter. Be quiet!</string>
  <string id="95947">And hardly worth it. You&apos;ve lost all passion.</string>
  <string id="95948">I only wanted to ensure loyalty. I still care for you.</string>
  <string id="95950">I will have Kang construct slippers. Your obedience is all I want.</string>
  <string id="95951">Be grateful. You will stand at my side. Or slightly behind.</string>
  <string id="95952">I had to preserve loyalty. As a princess, don&apos;t you understand?</string>
  <string id="95954">Say what you wish. I will not be swayed.</string>
  <string id="95955">I was left with no choice in the matter.</string>
  <string id="95956">You seemed perfectly happy to let me have my way two nights ago.</string>
  <string id="95957">Fine, I will leave you alone.</string>
  <string id="95961">I hope there is time for us in all of this.</string>
  <string id="95962">Everyone will respect the power I bring.</string>
  <string id="95964">I have made some difficult decisions to get here.</string>
  <string id="95966">Be ready. I will signal when we will leave.</string>
  <string id="95967" soundid="148589"></string>
  <string id="95969" soundid="148591">I am not here to fight you. I have information you might find useful... if you are willing to trade for it.</string>
  <string id="95970" soundid="148592">Not quite yet. There is much you do not know, and I may yet enlighten you... for a price.</string>
  <string id="95971" soundid="148593">Powerful forces are at work here. You are caught in great events that are beyond you. But I may have use for someone as... impetuous as you.</string>
  <string id="95972" soundid="148594">Trust? I never said we should trust each other. I don&apos;t trust you at all, but our goals may be similar.</string>
  <string id="95973" soundid="148595">I want nothing more than for you to continue your journey. You seek the old man who was taken from Two Rivers, correct? </string>
  <string id="95974" soundid="148596">Of course you do. He was taken by Death&apos;s Hand. I could tell you where his minions have gone... for a price.</string>
  <string id="95975" soundid="148597">A simple trade: I tell you where the abductors are, and you tell me who that old man is.</string>
  <string id="95976" soundid="148598">I&apos;ve underestimated you once. I will not do so again. Attack me here, and the local guards will have you in a noose.</string>
  <string id="95977" soundid="148599">What I ask is very reasonable: information for information. Tell me who he is.</string>
  <string id="95978" soundid="148600">You mix truth with lies. He must be more for Death&apos;s Hand to keep him alive. Still, you&apos;ve told me what I need to know.</string>
  <string id="95979" soundid="148601">Sun Li... ha! You think me a fool? You are either a liar or very, very confused.</string>
  <string id="95980" soundid="148602">You don&apos;t know as much as you think you do. But you have answered my question, and I will answer in kind.</string>
  <string id="95981" soundid="148603">The Glorious Strategist has been dead for twenty years! Everyone knows this! You mean to confuse me, but I am not a willing fool.</string>
  <string id="95982" soundid="148604">No idea? I saw your concern over the destruction of the village. Do not think to fool me!</string>
  <string id="95983" soundid="148605">I will let you maintain this deception for now, just to see where it leads, but we share an enemy in Death&apos;s Hand. For that reason, I will help you.</string>
  <string id="95984" soundid="148606">It would take a season to reach the Imperial City by land or water. Air is the only quick way, but you need a wind map. I know the location of one.</string>
  <string id="95985" soundid="148607">Lord Yun governs much of the Great Southern Forest. He petitioned the Lotus Assassins for a wind map so he could settle a trade disruption.</string>
  <string id="95986" soundid="148608">Of course, that has earned him their attention, in addition to whatever trouble is infesting his lands. I doubt he has time for charity, but you might try to find him.</string>
  <string id="95987" soundid="148609">Upriver from this village is a pirate stronghold, the river fortress of Gao the Greater, a minion of Death&apos;s Hand.</string>
  <string id="95988" soundid="148610">The flyers that attacked your village came from that stronghold... and returned there.</string>
  <string id="95989" soundid="148611">The old man must have passed through it. He may still be there, although I know that Death&apos;s Hand has already moved on.</string>
  <string id="95990" soundid="148612">I have matters of my own to attend. If you survive, we will see what use you are to me.</string>
  <string id="95991" soundid="148613">Do not presume familiarity with me. Our paths have crossed for a moment, but no more. I have matters of my own to attend.</string>
  <string id="95992" soundid="148614">His flyers give the Lotus Assassins mobility and speed. If you can stop Gao, or even hinder him, you will hurt Death&apos;s Hand.</string>
  <string id="95993" soundid="148615">Remember, if you want to reach the Imperial City, you must go to the forest and get that map from Lord Yun. My path takes me elsewhere.</string>
  <string id="95994" soundid="148616">If you actually reach the Imperial City, I will be impressed. Until then, I wish you luck. You are a surprising little peasant.</string>
  <string id="95995" soundid="148617"></string>
  <string id="95996" soundid="148618">Remember, if you seek the old man or revenge on Death&apos;s Hand, go to Gao&apos;s fortress. My path takes me elsewhere.</string>
  <string id="95997" soundid="148619">I do not seek a servant in you. Although that much fire in a man&apos;s spirit is... stimulating.</string>
  <string id="95998" soundid="148620">Stop where you are.</string>
  <string id="95999" soundid="148621">It is clear that you are one of his hirelings, or perhaps one of Gao the Greater&apos;s marauding pirates. You will pay for the crimes you have committed.</string>
  <string id="96000" soundid="148622">Don&apos;t waste your last breath on lies. I didn&apos;t get there in time to help anyone, but I saw you leave the massacre in Two Rivers. Clearly you were involved.</string>
  <string id="96001" soundid="148623">Death&apos;s Hand went too far in ordering its destruction, and Gao the Greater sought to profit from it. My retribution will end with them, but it will begin with you.</string>
  <string id="96002" soundid="148624"></string>
  <string id="96003" soundid="148625"></string>
  <string id="96004" soundid="148626">Enough!</string>
  <string id="96005" soundid="148627">The way you move seems odd... a flaw I cannot see, perhaps? But you are... better than I expected. You might even beat me, if I allowed such insolence. </string>
  <string id="96006" soundid="148628">You are too skilled to be just a hireling. Death&apos;s Hand would view such ability outside his assassins as... dangerous, and Gao the Greater prefers his servants docile.</string>
  <string id="96007" soundid="148629">So it would appear. You lack their branding... but if you are not one of them, who are you? A monk? A mercenary? A bandit?</string>
  <string id="96008" soundid="148630">You chase a great evil... larger than you realize. Leave, and you may survive. Others have tried to face Death&apos;s Hand, but were destroyed, as Two Rivers was.</string>
  <string id="96009">Bamboo Cask</string>
  <string id="96010" soundid="148632">Your honor sends you toward peril, but you do not flinch from it.</string>
  <string id="96011" soundid="148633">A trait of fools... and perhaps the occasional hero. I also seek answers from Death&apos;s Hand and his minions.</string>
  <string id="96012" soundid="148634">If you truly oppose him, you will need to find your way to the Imperial City. Of course, only the Lotus Assassins can come and go as they please, thanks to Gao.</string>
  <string id="96013" soundid="148635">Travel routes by land and water are blocked, but they use wind maps and flyers to further their goals here and in the surrounding forest.</string>
  <string id="96014" soundid="148636">Perhaps, if you are capable, we will meet again. I wish you good luck, but you will need far more than that to survive.</string>
  <string id="96015" soundid="148637"></string>
  <string id="96016" soundid="148638">You show no fear, even after seeing the power he wields.</string>
  <string id="96017" soundid="148639">Death&apos;s Hand may be our common foe, but the enemy of my enemy is not necessarily my friend.</string>
  <string id="96018" soundid="148640">I see truth in your eyes; you seek revenge on Death&apos;s Hand. You are not my enemy, but... who are you? A monk? A mercenary? A bandit?</string>
  <string id="96019" soundid="148641">You have managed to survive. I suppose someone of your skill cannot be easily dissuaded.</string>
  <string id="96020" soundid="148642">You may call me Silk Fox. I apologize for my previous aggression, but I thought you were in league with an enemy of mine. I was clearly mistaken.</string>
  <string id="96021" soundid="148643">You are more skilled than I expected, but I rarely need to escape from anyone. I had to... step back, which allowed me to see that you are not my enemy.</string>
  <string id="96023">Student remains</string>
  <string id="96025">I do not follow Death&apos;s Hand.</string>
  <string id="96026">What do you know of Gao the Greater?</string>
  <string id="96027">Get out of my way. You won&apos;t delay my revenge.</string>
  <string id="96033">I am not in league with Gao or the Lotus Assassins.</string>
  <string id="96035">Chair</string>
  <string id="96036">That is why I must face him: to avenge the dead.</string>
  <string id="96038">I will pursue them both! I am not afraid!</string>
  <string id="96043">My business with Death&apos;s Hand is my own!</string>
  <string id="96045">Who are you? Why do you fight the Lotus Assassins?</string>
  <string id="96047">Get out of my way. I&apos;m after Death&apos;s Hand!</string>
  <string id="96049">Who are you? Why did you attack me?</string>
  <string id="96051">Another ambush? You barely escaped last time.</string>
  <string id="96053">Get out of my way.</string>
  <string id="96055">Why should I trust you?</string>
  <string id="96057">What do you want?</string>
  <string id="96059">What do you want for this information?</string>
  <string id="96060">I could beat it out of you. You can&apos;t defeat me.</string>
  <string id="96062">The old man was Master Li, my teacher.</string>
  <string id="96064">He is Sun Li the Glorious Strategist, the Emperor&apos;s brother.</string>
  <string id="96065">Believe what you will. I know the truth.</string>
  <string id="96067">Do not call me a liar!</string>
  <string id="96069">Why? What do you know?</string>
  <string id="96070">I have no idea. Now, tell me where his captors have gone.</string>
  <string id="96077">Help me to defeat Death&apos;s Hand.</string>
  <string id="96079">Now that we&apos;re friends, who are you really?</string>
  <string id="96081">What do you know of Gao?</string>
  <string id="96083">Thank you for your help. Farewell.</string>
  <string id="96087">I will not be your errand-boy!</string>
  <string id="96089">I will not be your errand-girl!</string>
  <string id="96090" soundid="148712"></string>

  <string id="96092" soundid="151054">I know you&apos;re very busy, but if you happen to have time and be passing by the beach, I&apos;d appreciate it if you would at least ask Old Ming.</string>
  <string id="96093" soundid="151055">If I&apos;m lucky, he might know of an herb, and if heaven smiles upon me, he&apos;ll know where to find some.</string>
  <string id="96094">I think I know enough about this herb.</string>
  <string id="96098" soundid="151063">I hope you took a moment to celebrate as you flooded the valley.</string>
  <string id="96099" soundid="151064">Whatever you hoped to achieve by drowning that sad place will soon be undone.</string>
  <string id="96100" soundid="151065">Sergeant, if you will, eliminate this pest.</string>
  <string id="96101" soundid="151066">You hope to appeal to my sense of pity? What&apos;s next? &quot;The town was suffering. Think of the people!&quot; Bah. My loyalty is to the Empire!</string>
  <string id="96102" soundid="151067">That is precisely the idea. I&apos;m sure you are very confident in your skills, but I assure you that these fine men of the Imperial Army are more than your match.</string>
  <string id="96103" soundid="151068">The Sergeant knows his place, and he understands that what we Assassins do is for the good of the Empire as a whole.</string>
  <string id="96104" soundid="151069">If a few people suffer, then they do so for the glory of Emperor Sun.</string>
  <string id="96105" soundid="151070">You treasonous dog! This dam is one of Emperor Sun Hai&apos;s great civic projects, and you smash its controls like they were nothing!</string>
  <string id="96106" soundid="151071">Your acts spit in the face of our glorious Empire, and for your treason, you will die.</string>
  <string id="96107" soundid="151072">An order given by the Lotus Assassins is obeyed without question, and to the letter. No one wanted those controls to be disabled permanently!</string>
  <string id="96108" soundid="151073">These worms are beneath my notice, let alone my concern.</string>
  <string id="96109" soundid="151074">We are the will of the Emperor, and if we choose to flood this place or empty it, that is our prerogative.</string>
  <string id="96110" soundid="151075">You have interfered with our plans, and now you will die. That is the way of things.</string>
  <string id="96113">Wait! You don&apos;t need to follow this Assassin&apos;s orders, Sergeant!</string>
  <string id="96115">You&apos;ll have to go through me if you want to open this dam again.</string>
  <string id="96119">It was your order that emptied this lake in the first place.</string>
  <string id="96121">An Assassin caring about the people of Tien&apos;s Landing? Won&apos;t that make you seem weak?</string>

  <string id="96209" soundid="148831">I do not know who you have become. When this is all done, will the people of the Empire recognize you as one of their own or just another tyrant?</string>
  <string id="96210" soundid="148832">Was it? If you believe that, then you truly do not understand the depth of my shame for my actions.</string>
  <string id="96211" soundid="148833">It would seem that you do not understand me, or the shame I now feel because of this imprisonment.</string>
  <string id="96212" soundid="148834">There was a time I kept thoughts of you very close to my heart. Now I want you out.</string>
  <string id="96213" soundid="148835">I wish you would, but I feel your mind within me.</string>
  <string id="96214" soundid="148836">We are a long way from the farm I once called home. I never thought I would make such a journey.</string>
  <string id="96215" soundid="148837">But you have shown me what power can bring. The closer we get to our goal, the more intrigued and... excited I am at your potential.</string>
  <string id="96216" soundid="148838">The toy you have taken is interesting too. It is a shame that Dawn Star and the princess could not appreciate the value of having Death&apos;s Hand as a puppet.</string>
  <string id="96217" soundid="148839">Time? Of course. Who would dare stop us? If you will it, it will be.</string>
  <string id="96218" soundid="148840">Anything else would be unbearable. I can&apos;t even begin to think about what we will do after this is finished, but I want whatever it is to keep us together.</string>
  <string id="96219" soundid="148841">And many of those who have fallen deserved to do so, but there will come a time when all the tyrants will be gone. I hope your rage will depart with them.</string>
  <string id="96220" soundid="148842">Yes, the old oppressors must be ousted. Then you will have enough power to enforce the freedom that people deserve.</string>
  <string id="96221" soundid="148843">Such anger in your voice. When this is all done, I will help you enjoy some simpler things. Your burden is too great.</string>
  <string id="96222" soundid="148844">I will help you carry that weight, but I&apos;m not sure how much use I can be.</string>
  <string id="96223" soundid="148845">I will stand by you. Once the corruption is excised, the Jade Empire will be a blank slate, my friend.</string>
  <string id="96224" soundid="148846">You seem poised to take control of the Empire. Power brings freedom, and I will be there to do what I can.</string>
  <string id="96225" soundid="148847">Nothing can move me from your side. No matter what comes, I will be there for you.</string>
  <string id="96226" soundid="148848">I will be ready. Rely on it.</string>
  <string id="96227" soundid="148849">It is a shame you could not take Death&apos;s Hand for your own, but I suppose it is best to cast off old enemies whenever possible.</string>
  <string id="96229" soundid="148851">I am sorry for the pain I caused you. I risked everything. I will not take this new opportunity you have given me for granted.</string>
  <string id="96230" soundid="148852">Your master is a formidable opponent. We cannot leave the Empire in his hands.</string>
  <string id="96256">What does the central pedestal do?</string>
  <string id="96258">What colors typically represent what seasons?</string>
  <string id="96260">Can you tell me anything else?</string>
  <string id="96261">Could you repeat what you said before about the furnaces?</string>
  <string id="96276" soundid="155009">What! Zi Bao? Gone? It&apos;s... it&apos;s all my fault. I never should have entrusted this mission to a stranger. And now I&apos;ll have Songtao&apos;s death on my hands.
</string>
  <string id="96277">My style is faulty!</string>
  <string id="96278" soundid="155011">Here you are! I was despairing for your return. What news do you bring? </string>
  <string id="96281">Back off!</string>
  <string id="96284" soundid="151221">His corpse has risen, covered in the protective wrappings he was buried in. I... I would not have survived. Please, get the liver from him quickly!</string>
  <string id="96285" soundid="151222">He lies buried in one of the large tower-tombs closer to the entrance of the Necropolis. His body has risen, covered in the preservative garments it was buried in.</string>
  <string id="96286" soundid="151223">He is most dangerous. If I had not fled, I don&apos;t think he would have left me alive. Be careful there, but please, hurry so my daughter can be saved!</string>
  <string id="96289">Tell me about the nobleman.</string>
  <string id="96291" soundid="151229">Leave Zhong alone.</string>
  <string id="96292" soundid="151230">Zhong! You can&apos;t stay up here forever. This isn&apos;t your home! You need to come back with me to the farm.</string>
  <string id="96293" soundid="151231">No! Zhong not want to go home. Zhong doesn&apos;t want to see ox.</string>
  <string id="96294" soundid="151232">[sigh] It wasn&apos;t your fault... it was an accident. I need you back at the farm, now let&apos;s go, Zhong.</string>
  <string id="96295" soundid="151233">I am Dong Ping, Zhong&apos;s employer. Zhong works on my farm, but the other day, he accidentally killed one of my oxen, and since then he has refused to come back.</string>
  <string id="96296" soundid="151234">Zhong is no ordinary ogre. He is, despite his simple nature, very skilled.</string>
  <string id="96297" soundid="158330">Well, I&apos;m glad to see you are back. What was that all about?</string>
  <string id="96298" soundid="151236">Some of the patrons here are unnerved by his size. I&apos;m worried that if he doesn&apos;t leave with me soon, the owners may take matters into their own hands.</string>
  <string id="96299" soundid="151237">If he gets hurt... or worse, I&apos;ll be ruined. I can&apos;t run the farm without him. But I don&apos;t know what else to do. He won&apos;t listen to me.</string>
  <string id="96300" soundid="151238">You... will? I must warn you... Zhong is... well, he&apos;s very strong willed, and very strong. I am grateful for your help, but please be careful.</string>
  <string id="96301" soundid="151239">Zhong the Ox Carrier came by his name honestly. I would hate to see him hurt you, or anybody else, for that matter. Speak softly to him, and you should be okay.</string>
  <string id="96302" soundid="151240">Yes, indeed it is.</string>
  <string id="96303" soundid="154597">Excellent idea. Your next opponent is Third Brother Renshan.</string>
  <string id="96304" soundid="154598">Once you&apos;ve defeated Third Brother, come and see me. Good luck.</string>
  <string id="96305" soundid="154599">A good idea. Your next opponent is Fourth Brother Yu.</string>
  <string id="96306" soundid="151244">What have you done? How will I run my farm now? It&apos;s bad enough with things the way they are in town. Now I&apos;m surely ruined!</string>
  <string id="96310">Who are you, and who is Zhong?</string>
  <string id="96311">What&apos;s the matter with your ogre?</string>
  <string id="96313">What are you doing with an ogre?</string>
  <string id="96317">Don&apos;t worry, I&apos;ll speak with him.</string>
  <string id="96318">I&apos;ll make sure he leaves.</string>
  <string id="96320">That&apos;s your problem, old man.</string>
  <string id="96321" soundid="154600">A wise decision. Your next opponent is Fifth Brother Shangjin.</string>
  <string id="96322" soundid="154601">Very good. Your next opponent is Sixth Brother Gaoshan.</string>
  <string id="96323" soundid="151261">Go away! Zhong not want to speak to you.</string>
  <string id="96324" soundid="151262">Zhong kill ox. Zhong too strong, too rough with ox. Zhong not want to hurt ox, Zhong only playing. Now Zhong cries for ox.</string>
  <string id="96325" soundid="151263">Zhong not want to go. Zhong think you should go before Zhong get angry. Zhong not mean to kill ox... but will mean to kill you if you make Zhong mad.</string>
  <string id="96326" soundid="151264">Ox like to play with Zhong. Ox like it when Zhong throw her in the air and catch her. Zhong missed. Zhong dropped ox on her head. Ox is dead.</string>
  <string id="96327" soundid="151265">Zhong no play game. Leave Zhong alone, or Zhong will crush you. I will throw you and drop you on your head like I did to ox.</string>
  <string id="96328" soundid="151266">Ox was Zhong&apos;s friend. Zhong killed a friend, and now Zhong is bad.</string>
  <string id="96329" soundid="151267">Master already have another ox. Poor ox... Zhong killed ox&apos;s sister. Now ox won&apos;t like Zhong anymore.</string>
  <string id="96330" soundid="151268">Master have other ox. Master won&apos;t starve... master better off without Zhong.</string>
  <string id="96331" soundid="151269">Ox not dumb... ox was smart. Ox&apos;s brother is dumb... but now ox has no sister. Zhong is very bad.</string>
  <string id="96332" soundid="151270">[Success] Zhong is lonely. Ox must be lonely, too. Maybe ox will forgive Zhong, and we be friends again. I will go and see.</string>
  <string id="96333" soundid="151271">You have been nice to Zhong. Zhong like you. Zhong hope you have good day.</string>
  <string id="96334" soundid="151272">Noooo! Zhong won&apos;t let you hurt ox!</string>
  <string id="96335">Why are you so upset?</string>
  <string id="96336">My, you&apos;re a big one aren&apos;t you?</string>
  <string id="96337">Get out of here, Zhong, or I&apos;ll throw you out!</string>
  <string id="96338">I believe you. I&apos;m sure you didn&apos;t do it on purpose.</string>
  <string id="96339">Tell me exactly how it happened, Zhong.</string>
  <string id="96341">No more games, Zhong! It&apos;s time to leave.</string>
  <string id="96343">Maybe you can get another ox.</string>
  <string id="96345">You don&apos;t have a choice. Look at me.</string>
  <string id="96346">You seemed to like such direction the other night.</string>
  <string id="96347">You can still be of use to me. You might even enjoy it.</string>
  <string id="96348">Ooh, you don&apos;t like being a plaything? Lingering guilt over past behavior, perhaps?</string>
  <string id="96349">Goodbye for now.</string>
  <string id="96350">Silence!</string>
  <string id="96351">I find your tone very unappealing.</string>
  <string id="96353">You are so distant. Is this really so bad?</string>
  <string id="96355">Certain obedience is far more useful to me than trust.</string>
  <string id="96356">The handsome rogue is lecturing me on using people? Amusing.</string>
  <string id="96357">I have learned to use my strength. Is that so bad?</string>
  <string id="96359">It had to be done. That is all I will say.</string>
  <string id="96360">I am sorry, but binding you was necessary.</string>
  <string id="96361">I know your shame. I quite enjoyed it the other night.</string>
  <string id="96362">Fine, I will leave you alone.</string>
  <string id="96365">Will there still be time for us after all this is done?</string>
  <string id="96366">I will destroy anything in my way.</string>
  <string id="96367">Some of these decisions have been hard to make.</string>
  <string id="96369">Ready yourself. We will be leaving soon.</string>
  <string id="96548" soundid="149170"></string>
  <string id="96549" soundid="149171">I am no common bandit. I&apos;ve been hunted by far worse than you!</string>
  <string id="96550" soundid="149172">Let&apos;s go. The main camp is to the north, but there are soldiers all around this area. If you want to find trouble, let&apos;s do it quickly.</string>
  <string id="96551" soundid="149173">I do not blame you. There are times when *I* do not trust myself, but I will help you here today.</string>
  <string id="96552" soundid="149174">You don&apos;t really have much to lose by following my lead. You would have to turn back without it. Now, let&apos;s get moving.</string>
  <string id="96553" soundid="149175">I can refuse some fool determined to get lost in the swamp, but I doubt your friend earned her fate. Gao the Lesser shouldn&apos;t get such a prize without a fair fight.</string>
  <string id="96554" soundid="149176">Dawn Star? I know that name, but I still can&apos;t... I don&apos;t look for trouble. Fighting about it is pointless. You would still be left without your directions.</string>
  <string id="96555" soundid="149177">Gao the Lesser? I know the family. This is a brazen act, even for them, but now I understand why their men are clearing a path through the marsh.</string>
  <string id="96556" soundid="149178">Carrying someone? They took someone from your village? That is very brazen, even for them, but it explains why they are clearing a path through the marsh.</string>
  <string id="96557" soundid="149179">If you know that name you know they are not choosy about who they attack. Would a bandit stop to ask you why you are in the marsh?</string>
  <string id="96558" soundid="149180">I see your point. There are differences. Tien was a knowledgeable man, whereas I feel that a person can sometimes think too much.</string>
  <string id="96559" soundid="149181">I don&apos;t believe I need to explain myself beyond that.</string>
  <string id="96560" soundid="149182">I meant nothing. It&apos;s just that I was trained fairly well, so I recognize when someone else is skilled.</string>
  <string id="96561" soundid="149183">I am no bandit. Stay on your guard if you want, but I have no desire to test your training. I&apos;ve passed through your village once or twice. I&apos;ve seen your skill.</string>
  <string id="96562" soundid="166418">Yes, this is her. She killed the twisted ones for us.</string>
  <string id="96563">Vase</string>
  <string id="96564" soundid="166419">Yes, this is him. They died because of him; the monsters.</string>
  <string id="96565" soundid="149502"></string>
  <string id="96566">Tell me more about yourself, Hou.</string>
  <string id="96569" soundid="155720">There&apos;s always fire in his eyes. Dark magic burns inside him.</string>
  <string id="96570" soundid="155721">Yeah, but this time it was worse. Better stay out of his way for the next little while. Something really set him off.</string>
  <string id="96571" soundid="149509">Suspicious? Oh, heavens no. Everyone here is extremely legitimate and completely normal. Yes, indeed.</string>
  <string id="96572" soundid="149510">Erm... well, no, not him. He, of course, isn&apos;t usual in the usual... er, sense. Not at all. Everyone else, though, is perfectly legitimate.</string>
  <string id="96573" soundid="149511">General questions? Who has time for such mundane subjects! Go ask one of the scholars. One of the *other* scholars, that is.</string>
  <string id="96574" soundid="149512">Indeed you should. There are many things that I must attend to or science itself will suffer.</string>
  <string id="96575" soundid="149513">I&apos;m still here. Have you figured out what you&apos;re going to do with this poor wretch yet?</string>
  <string id="96576" soundid="149514">You need more proof than my pathetic attempt to pose as a scholar? How about the fact that Lord Rento was out of town when I &quot;bilked&quot; him.</string>
  <string id="96577" soundid="149515">Not that anyone but Lady Rento will confirm that for you. Still, it should be apparent that I&apos;m not some great confidence man.</string>
  <string id="96578" soundid="149516">I&apos;ll admit that I can&apos;t match the bounty on my head, but I could give you half of what they&apos;re offering. I have an idea how I could get out of the city, too.</string>
  <string id="96579" soundid="158226">Remember: Find my body in the palace and destroy it, or you will not be able to defeat Sun Li. Enter the portal. I return to you the life that was so wrongly taken.</string>
  <string id="96580" soundid="149518">We should go see Captain Sen right away if you&apos;re sure. Is now a fair time to go down to the gate to get me out of here?</string>
  <string id="96581" soundid="149519">The only easy way out of this city is through the gate that Sen is guarding, and he&apos;s looking for me.</string>
  <string id="96582" soundid="149520">However, if I disguise myself as a mercenary and sneak past him, I might just get away, but you have to help me by distracting him.</string>
  <string id="96583" soundid="149521">Just tell him that I&apos;ve already escaped, and I&apos;ll get away just fine. I can&apos;t imagine what might go wrong.</string>
  <string id="96584" soundid="149522">I understand. Attend to whatever else you had to do, and if you are still willing to help me, come back and see me.</string>
  <string id="96585" soundid="149523">[Sigh] All the best actors die young.</string>
  <string id="96586" soundid="149524">I suppose I&apos;ll just wait here. There&apos;s no point in running, as you could track me down easily enough.</string>
  <string id="96587" soundid="155722">Wait a minute... you there! Who are you? You can&apos;t be up here!</string>
  <string id="96589" soundid="149527">I hope you&apos;re not here to pester me. I&apos;m a very busy, important, and educated man, you know!</string>
  <string id="96590" soundid="149528">Don&apos;t even bother lying to us. It&apos;s clear you&apos;re no scholar.</string>
  <string id="96591" soundid="149529">Of course not! I&apos;m... oh drat. This isn&apos;t working at all. How did you know?</string>
  <string id="96592" soundid="149530">You&apos;re here to hunt me down, then? Lord Rento has it in for me, and I figured it would come to this.</string>
  <string id="96593" soundid="149215"></string>
  <string id="96594" soundid="149216"></string>
  <string id="96595" soundid="149217">So, there is no discouraging you. You have come to the heart of the Assassins, and you already have enemies. Are you certain you are ready for what you will learn here?</string>
  <string id="96596" soundid="149218">I don&apos;t think the choice is yours anymore. This is my realm, where my demons hide. You will be forced to see them.</string>
  <string id="96597" soundid="149219">You have shown little interest in my warnings, but now you will see.</string>
  <string id="96598" soundid="149220">We have discussed much in our time together, but not everything. I left some things buried, but now you have descended to their level.</string>
  <string id="96599" soundid="149221">Whose side is worthy of having me? Is your motivation so clear now that you walk these halls?</string>
  <string id="96600" soundid="149222">Are you? Are you sure you know what kind of person I am? Is anyone so transparent? Are you?</string>
  <string id="96601" soundid="149223">Go, your new master is waiting. Secure a place near the heart of the Assassins, and you will be near your goal. Grand Inquisitor Jia is key.</string>
  <string id="96605" soundid="149227">It wasn&apos;t always like this. Fear used to be the primary tactic. Destroy the family of one to ensure the loyalty of all. It caused chaos, uprisings. Close allies turning on each other.</string>
  <string id="96606" soundid="157295">Kill Master Shin, my superior.</string>
  <string id="96607" soundid="157296">You are beneath notice, but you have surprising skill. No one will suspect you are planning such a thing, and no one will miss you if I have to kill you for refusing.</string>
  <string id="96610" soundid="165697">I&apos;ll get out of here yet! You&apos;ll see!</string>
  <string id="96612" soundid="149234">You approach the soul extractor. The Assassins want you to create a spirit shard; to crush a life to power a golem puppet. They are very efficient in their brutality now.</string>
  <string id="96613">Why trust me with this? I have only just arrived.</string>
  <string id="96614" soundid="149236">They seek control. There used to be a chance to disobey, when the order given was too harsh... the victims pointlessly innocent. Now there is only obedience.</string>
  <string id="96616" soundid="149238">Just go, the thieves await you. Remember, the deepest mines. They are closed now, for being too... troublesome. That is where you will find what you need.</string>
  <string id="96617" soundid="149239">I was one of the elite, and before that, part of the Order of the Lotus, but I am still shut out of some places.</string>
  <string id="96618" soundid="149240">The deep tombs hold malevolent spirits from a time when the Empire nearly fell. Chaotic and powerful, they hunger for revenge. I&apos;m sorry, but I must be sure of what you are.</string>
  <string id="96619" soundid="149241">Zeng Sai the Tree that Defies the Fire was one of many that threatened to level the Imperial City. The Spirit Monks, your people, stopped them. Or so they claimed.</string>
  <string id="96620" soundid="149242">I gambled that the vengeful spirits of these marauders would sense if you truly are a Spirit Monk. So many people are not what they seem to be. I had to be certain.</string>
  <string id="96626" soundid="149248">The Assassins use slaves for their golems now, in part because of tombs like this. That was a remnant of the Old Empire, the spirit of an ancient invading Horselord.</string>
  <string id="96627" soundid="149249">I had to be certain. I won&apos;t trouble you much longer. Now that you have disrupted Zeng Sai&apos;s spirit, you can take his body from his grave and use it in the extractor.</string>
  <string id="96628" soundid="149250">Even in life his kind were devoid of restraint. His spirit is pure chaos; a shard made using his ancient corpse will cripple the Jade Golem and those it commands.</string>
  <string id="96629" soundid="149251">Present the shard to your master, and it will earn you passage to the inner chambers. There you will find the information you seek, and you can proceed to the palace.</string>
  <string id="96630" soundid="149252">I will make that plain soon enough. Appease your master. When you are ready to enter the inner chambers, I will tell you why your success is so important. </string>
  <string id="96631" soundid="149253">This fortress holds many secrets. Some are valuable, some are dangerous, and some are hidden because the dark is where they belong.</string>
  <string id="96632" soundid="149254">Even if you are acting on selfish instinct, you have to see that leaving your enemy stronger would be foolish. This was a profitable move.</string>
  <string id="96633" soundid="149255">When you finish your master&apos;s other task, present the shard to earn passage to the inner chambers. Inside is the information you need to proceed to the palace.</string>
  <string id="96634" soundid="149256">You could, but I won&apos;t trouble you much longer, anyway. Now that you have disrupted Zeng Sai&apos;s spirit, you can take his body and use it in the extractor.</string>
  <string id="96635" soundid="149257">You are nearing your goal. Grand Inquisitor Jia keeps many secrets in the inner chambers. Enough to appease the Princess and earn your way to the palace.</string>
  <string id="96636" soundid="149258">But you may learn more than she wants to know. I know that I did, many years ago.</string>
  <string id="96637" soundid="149259">You know that Master Li tried to stop his brother and failed. I was not there to witness that, so I only have the details that you are aware of yourself.</string>
  <string id="96638" soundid="149260">Hui in Tien&apos;s Landing told you that in response to that act, Master Li&apos;s wife was condemned to death. She was with child at the time. This I know for certain.</string>
  <string id="96639" soundid="149261">I was there. I was one of the elite ordered to kill Master Li&apos;s family.</string>
  <string id="96640" soundid="149262">Death&apos;s Hand brought the order to kill the family. We were cowards if we could not see the wisdom of his order. It was the will of the Emperor.</string>
  <string id="96641" soundid="149263">I could not question the orders. They could not be wrong.</string>
  <string id="96642" soundid="149264">Dirge was burning, your master had fled, and we stood over a woman who had just given birth. I hesitated... and she was killed.</string>
  <string id="96643" soundid="149265">For years I wondered what kind of creature could issue such an order and what I was for following it. It was easier to be a coward than to question the Empire.</string>
  <string id="96644" soundid="149266">Now I understand, and I hope I have shown you, as well. They broke a sacred trust. I have returned because of that, even though I know what Death&apos;s Hand is.</string>
  <string id="96645" soundid="149267">My fate is sealed, but one secret must live on. I killed them all, my fellow Assassins. I would not let them finish their mission.</string>
  <string id="96646" soundid="149268">Master Li&apos;s child still lives.</string>
  <string id="96647" soundid="149269">You needed to know my role, even if you have not proven to me that you are any more thoughtful than those you pursue. I have secrets that will remain mine.</string>
  <string id="96648" soundid="149270">It shows the depths to which even principled men will sink if the order comes from high enough. If you don&apos;t want to listen, fine. I will keep my secrets.</string>
  <string id="96649" soundid="149271">But heed a simple warning. If your enemy begins to look familiar, it&apos;s not because *they* are changing. It took me a long time to learn that.</string>
  <string id="96650" soundid="149272">I have little use for morals, but honor? I have seen what you will face, seen his power. I ran once.... I hope for your sake you have not shaken my resolve.</string>
  <string id="96651" soundid="149531">I don&apos;t suppose running would do me any good?</string>
  <string id="96652" soundid="149532">This is what passes for justice in the Imperial City?</string>
  <string id="96653" soundid="149533">I was unjustly accused! I simply petitioned Lady Rento for some silver to support me as an actor! Patronage, it&apos;s called.</string>
  <string id="96654" soundid="149534">She agreed, but her husband flew into a rage when he found out, and now I have a death sentence on my head!</string>
  <string id="96655" soundid="149535">It&apos;s not fair, and if you were a decent person, you&apos;d help me get out of this city instead of taking me in. It&apos;s the only way I&apos;ll get clear of Lord Rento&apos;s wrath.</string>
  <string id="96656" soundid="149536">All manner of studies. The History of Dramatic Systems, Applied Theology, and... erm... Celestial Integration! All of these are vital pursuits of knowledge.</string>
  <string id="96657" soundid="149537">Not that you would understand such lofty matters.</string>
  <string id="96658" soundid="149538">Well, you see, drama can be broken down into several systems, and I study the history of those systems over time. How they&apos;ve changed, and that sort of thing.</string>
  <string id="96659" soundid="149281">I trust your plans go well, despite the dangers you face and inflict. Is there something I can do for you?</string>
  <string id="96660" soundid="160238"></string>
  <string id="96661" soundid="160239"></string>
  <string id="96666" soundid="149288">The time is coming, but not yet. There is a great challenge ahead of you, and I will be watching very closely.</string>
  <string id="96667" soundid="154299">Not everyone has to be destroyed. This wasn&apos;t necessary.</string>
  <string id="96668" soundid="154300">The pursuit of power demands sacrifice.</string>
  <string id="96669" soundid="149291">Goodbye.</string>
  <string id="96670" soundid="149292">I told you about your village, and that&apos;s all I&apos;m going to do. Get going. It&apos;s not my business, and you don&apos;t want it to be.</string>
  <string id="96671" soundid="149293">We should leave this place. Death&apos;s Hand obviously didn&apos;t want any survivors. He may send more Lotus Assassins to check on Gao&apos;s men.</string>
  <string id="96672" soundid="149294"></string>
  <string id="96673" soundid="149295">Hold your attack, young student. I am not your enemy. This was... a misunderstanding.</string>
  <string id="96674" soundid="149296">I have tried very hard to go unnoticed, but I also need to eat. I&apos;ve been on the outskirts of your village once or twice to trade goods. I saw you training.</string>
  <string id="96675" soundid="149297">My name is Zu. I have been called Sagacious Zu, if you prefer a title. It&apos;s a name I share with the first emperor, Sagacious Tien.</string>
  <string id="96676" soundid="149298">That is... a personal matter. You&apos;ll have to take my word that I&apos;m above common robbery, if not many other things.</string>
  <string id="96677" soundid="149299">Besides, I have already shown that I have no love for the more common kinds of filth roaming out here.</string>
  <string id="96678" soundid="149300">If you know that name you know the type of men the family employs. I wonder... does their increased presence in the marsh have anything to do with why you are here?</string>
  <string id="96679" soundid="149301">They took someone from your village? That is very brazen, and it explains why they wanted to clear a path through the marsh.</string>
  <string id="96680" soundid="149302">No wonder you came out here as you did; you&apos;re looking to rescue someone. You probably gave no thought to your own safety.</string>
  <string id="96681" soundid="149303">That is very selfless of you. I tend to think more... efficiently.</string>
  <string id="96682" soundid="149304">I did hear something about a camp. They seem to be killing bandits so they won&apos;t be disturbed. There wasn&apos;t much more. I just wanted some peace and quiet.</string>
  <string id="96683" soundid="149305">No. I&apos;m not interested in looking for trouble. I&apos;m sorry, but I have my reasons. As bad as this is, you are better off without my help.</string>
  <string id="96684">Your first special is Radiant Aura, a protective shield.</string>
  <string id="96685" soundid="149307">Dawn Star? I am... familiar with that name. But I still can&apos;t... I have spent a long time avoiding trouble. I don&apos;t want to go looking for it now.</string>
  <string id="96686" soundid="149308">I&apos;m sorry.</string>
  <string id="96687" soundid="149309"></string>
  <string id="96688" soundid="149310">Wait. Dawn Star... your friend... should not suffer because of my reluctance. A group of men went to the north. They had a large pack that was giving them trouble.</string>
  <string id="96689" soundid="149311">That may be where their camp is. There&apos;s no way to leave the marsh in that direction... not on foot, anyway. I will show you. It is easy to get lost.</string>
  <string id="96690" soundid="166479"></string>
  <string id="96691" soundid="149313">You don&apos;t know me. Never forget that.</string>
  <string id="96692" soundid="149314">Now come, we have some catching up to do. We&apos;ll find them. Like I said, they can&apos;t get out in that direction. Not on foot.</string>
  <string id="96693" soundid="149315">I will try not to make you regret it. Your task is probably complicated enough as it is.</string>
  <string id="96696">You act like you know me. I&apos;ve never seen you before.</string>
  <string id="96698">If you are not an enemy, why are you out here?</string>
  <string id="96700">Why were you fighting Gao&apos;s mercenaries?</string>
  <string id="96701">A student has disappeared under strange circumstances.</string>
  <string id="96705">You must know the swamp well. Can you lead me in the right direction?</string>
  <string id="96707">You were right: You&apos;re not a bandit, you&apos;re a coward. I&apos;ll find Dawn Star on my own.</string>
  <string id="96712">Rat Demon</string>
  <string id="96713">Thank you. I knew there was a shred of decency in you.</string>
  <string id="96715">Your assistance is welcome.</string>
  <string id="96717">I will go the way you say, but I will be watching you.</string>
  <string id="96719">Why should I believe you after you refused me before?</string>
  <string id="96720">You changed your mind when I mentioned Dawn Star. Why?</string>
  <string id="96722">Well, if you see a student named Dawn Star, at least show her how to get out of here.</string>
  <string id="96723">I should beat it out of you! Dawn Star deserves better than your cowardice!</string>
  <string id="96725">You seem familiar with their type. Is there anything else you can tell me?</string>
  <string id="96727">My friend is missing. Gao the Lesser may have something to do with it.</string>
  <string id="96729">Just tell me if there are more and if they were carrying someone!</string>
  <string id="96731">Gao&apos;s men seem to be clearing the marsh of outlaws. You could be a bandit.</string>
  <string id="96732">I don&apos;t picture a thoughtful and perceptive emperor fighting in a swamp.</string>
  <string id="96734">Why would my training interest you?</string>
  <string id="96735">I&apos;m in a hurry. Someone was taken from the village by Gao the Lesser.</string>
  <string id="96736">You could be just another bandit. Keep your distance.</string>
  <string id="96738" soundid="149539">Well, it&apos;s the application of the study of theological things, isn&apos;t it? For instance, knowing about spirits and then finding a use for that knowledge.</string>
  <string id="96739" soundid="149540">Well, no, not really. This is the study of applied theology, not the application of studied theology. That&apos;s something else entirely!</string>
  <string id="96740" soundid="149541">Celestial integration means just that; it&apos;s integrated... celestially. Thus the relationship between the heavens and earth is one of integration and, er, celestial.</string>
  <string id="96741" soundid="149542">It&apos;s a very advanced field of research. It would take several lifetimes to understand it properly, which is why my position as a scholar is so irrefutable.</string>
  <string id="96742" soundid="149543">Oh, I doubt it. You don&apos;t look the type for heavy reading.</string>
  <string id="96743" soundid="149544">No, but I am, and I certainly haven&apos;t heard of you.</string>
  <string id="96744" soundid="149545">You&apos;re far too fit to be properly read.</string>
  <string id="96745" soundid="149546">Of course, none of my books are published yet, but as a scholar, and a respected one, I will most certainly pen some marvelous books someday.</string>
  <string id="96746" soundid="149547">Well, yes... unless your theories are astoundingly brilliant, which is the case with me!</string>
  <string id="96747" soundid="149548">A shame. My studies are very important to me. I am a scholar, after all.</string>
  <string id="96748">You&apos;re Creative Yukong, aren&apos;t you?</string>
  <string id="96750">Let&apos;s call it a hunch.</string>
  <string id="96751">Your &quot;studies&quot; weren&apos;t very convincing.</string>
  <string id="96752">That was a pretty sad example of posing as a scholar.</string>
  <string id="96753">It won&apos;t matter in a few moments. You&apos;ll be dead.</string>
  <string id="96755">Lady Rento said the charges weren&apos;t real.</string>
  <string id="96756">How did someone of your skill manage to con a noble anyway?</string>
  <string id="96757">If you run, you&apos;ll only die tired.</string>
  <string id="96762">Whose side are you on, Zu?</string>
  <string id="96764">I am eager to have your help.</string>
  <string id="96773">If you know something that can help, get to the point.</string>
  <string id="96774" soundid="165701">Most people who decided to trail an Inquisitor would have been caught and eliminated within moments. You must be exceptionally skilled. Either that or you&apos;re lying to us.</string>
  <string id="96776" soundid="157314">The Imperial Army is weak, filled with questioning generals that do not know the path to glory. Even we Assassins envy the pure subservience of a golem.</string>
  <string id="96778">Can I ruin their plans *and* get what I need?</string>
  <string id="96779">Why should I trust you?</string>
  <string id="96780">Talk to Scholar Dongow</string>
  <string id="96781">If you have something useful to say, get to it!</string>
  <string id="96782">I&apos;m sick of you interrupting! How are you avoiding capture?</string>
  <string id="96789">Red Minister</string>
  <string id="96792">I trust I no longer need to prove myself to you?</string>
  <string id="96795">What do you mean, you won&apos;t be leaving?</string>
  <string id="96797">So you are staying? Rejoining your old accomplices?</string>
  <string id="96798">A normal shard would earn me passage, too. This battle was pointless.</string>
  <string id="96799">I should kill you where you stand.</string>
  <string id="96802">If you have something to say, Zu, now is the time.</string>
  <string id="96805">That is a remarkable admission. Go on.</string>
  <string id="96807">So you did it? You murdered my Master&apos;s family?</string>
  <string id="96813">The soldier always blames his commander.</string>
  <string id="96814">You take credit, but there is no way for me to verify this.</string>
  <string id="96815">Why does this matter now? What is the point of this?</string>
  <string id="96818">Zu! This better be important to interrupt now!</string>
  <string id="96822">What sort of studies keep you so busy?</string>
  <string id="96824">Why don&apos;t you tell me more about the History of Dramatic Systems?</string>
  <string id="96825">How have these systems changed?</string>
  <string id="96833">Are you ready to talk, Zu? </string>
  <string id="96834" soundid="154301">If a man can&apos;t defend himself, then what good is he, really?</string>
  <string id="96835" soundid="154302">That was... so cruel. I do not know if I have the stomach for this.</string>
  <string id="96836">Goodbye.</string>

  <string id="96842" soundid="149464">You have become Gang&apos;s favorite, and that diminishes the rest of us. The golem army is replacing us as it is. It&apos;s time you learned your place.</string>
  <string id="96843" soundid="149465">I disagree, and so do my companions. It is hard enough to get ahead in this place without you distracting the master!</string>
  <string id="96844" soundid="149466">After you fall, Master Gang will realize he should have focused on us instead of you. That&apos;s all that matters.</string>
  <string id="96845" soundid="149467">If his favorite acolyte falls, that will prove it was a mistake to neglect us! We regain our place, and you are gone!</string>
  <string id="96846" soundid="149468">We want our place back, and if you have to die for that to happen, that&apos;s fine with us!</string>
  <string id="96847" soundid="149469">I am prepared this time! If you fall, Master Gang will have to turn his attention back to us!</string>
  <string id="96848">I did not mean to offend. I am sure there is room for all of us.</string>
  <string id="96850">Master Gang will not appreciate his favorite acolyte being threatened.</string>
  <string id="96852">If more of you want to die at my hand, so be it!</string>

  <string id="96865" soundid="149488">I think it&apos;s unwise to trust the Emperor&apos;s daughter. She acts without regard for her station, but she is a slave to it, like we all are. What other truths might she have missed?</string>

  <string id="96877">Could you give me an example?</string>
  <string id="96878">Celestial integration? You made that one up.</string>
  <string id="96880">Do you have any works I would have read?</string>
  <string id="96884">Wouldn&apos;t you have to have written several books to be a respected scholar?</string>
  <string id="96885">Let&apos;s talk about something else.</string>
  <string id="96886">Have you spotted anyone acting suspicious here?</string>
  <string id="96887">Even the Outlander?</string>
  <string id="96888">Would you mind if I asked you some general questions?</string>
  <string id="96889">I should leave you to your thinking.</string>
  <string id="96890">Do you have any proof that you&apos;re falsely accused?</string>
  <string id="96892">What would my help be worth to you?</string>
  <string id="96893">I think I&apos;ll help you instead of collecting your bounty.</string>
  <string id="96894">I&apos;m ready to help you now.</string>
  <string id="96897">Not right now.</string>
  <string id="96898">I&apos;m not earning any silver talking to you. Time to collect a head.</string>
  <string id="96899">I don&apos;t really want to deal with you right now.</string>
  <string id="96903" soundid="149593">Anyone here could kill me, but there are always witnesses like those men over... uh... like those....</string>
  <string id="96904" soundid="149594">Hmm... it would appear that there would be no witness to my murder other than my slaves. That is... unfortunate. Perhaps we could come to an arrangement.</string>
  <string id="96905" soundid="149595">But... all they can do is hide until there&apos;s a chance of escape. Curse the heavens, I knew dealing with the Assassins would be the death of me!</string>
  <string id="96906" soundid="149596">Monstrous! Fight, slaves! Protect me! It&apos;s your lives too!</string>
  <string id="96907" soundid="149597">Then what? They try to hide until a slim chance for escape comes? Just because I force them to serve me doesn&apos;t mean I treat them poorly. They wouldn&apos;t harm me.</string>
  <string id="96908" soundid="149598">Would you?</string>
  <string id="96909" soundid="149599">Uh... your master demands an answer...?</string>
  <string id="96911">Move somewhere else. *Now!*</string>
  <string id="96912">Too late. I&apos;m killing you and setting your slaves free. I don&apos;t need your store.</string>
  <string id="96913">Too late. I don&apos;t need what you are selling anyway. I&apos;ll kill you *and* your slaves.</string>
  <string id="96914">Actually, it might be amusing to let your slaves kill you. </string>
  <string id="96918" soundid="149608">You know what you have to do. Let&apos;s get on with it.</string>
  <string id="96919" soundid="149609">The Lotus Assassin fortress is dangerous, but we have no other choice if we are to prove Death&apos;s Hand is a traitor.</string>

  <string id="96921" soundid="149611">I hate the assassins. Can&apos;t they see the strings that pull at them? They are unquestioning, and even believe they do my father&apos;s bidding by following Death&apos;s Hand.</string>
  <string id="96922" soundid="149612">I will expose all of this. Do everything your &quot;masters&quot; ask of you and they will take us into the inner chambers. Then we can prove all of this to my father.</string>
  <string id="96923" soundid="149613">You&apos;ve given me proof... even if I didn&apos;t want to hear it. We must go to the palace and confront my father. I must have an explanation.</string>
  <string id="96924" soundid="149614">I&apos;m ready to guide you to the palace whenever you wish to leave... though I would prefer it to be sooner rather than later.</string>
  <string id="96925" soundid="149615">There is no time for discussion. We should hurry to my father as quickly as possible.</string>
  <string id="96926">What do you think about our current situation?</string>
  <string id="96930" soundid="149620">Too large a subject for your mind to comprehend, I&apos;m sure.</string>
  <string id="96931" soundid="149621">This answer should be interesting. I have a question I would ask of this &quot;scholar&quot; if you would permit me.</string>
  <string id="96932" soundid="149622">Well, of course not. A student of theater are you?</string>
  <string id="96933" soundid="149623">I was just wondering about the recent shift in dramatic presentations away from the customary iterative productions where the fourth wall is regularly deconstructed.</string>
  <string id="96934" soundid="149624">Does the shift towards more codified productions, with barriers established between the presented world and the actual environment, create a more immersive experience?</string>
  <string id="96935" soundid="149625">I... er. Well... ah....</string>
  <string id="96936" soundid="149626">That&apos;s what I thought.</string>
  <string id="96937" soundid="149627">Well, there&apos;s the... new system, of course, but everyone knows that. Then we have the, er, old system, which, as you may surmise, is no longer in use.</string>
  <string id="96938" soundid="149628">That&apos;s a brief summary of my latest work, at any rate.</string>
  <string id="96939" soundid="149629">Oh, it&apos;s all very complex, and I really don&apos;t feel like describing it to you at any length.</string>
  <string id="96940" soundid="149630">That&apos;s how you know I&apos;m a scholar, you see. An unwillingness to share all the information I have.</string>
  <string id="96942">My friend would like to ask you a question, if you don&apos;t mind.</string>
  <string id="96947">Can you outline some of these systems for me?</string>

  <string id="96960" soundid="149650">This whole Scourge of the South thing sounds made up to me. How much trouble could one person cause?</string>
  <string id="96961" soundid="149651">If you need assistance, Bai the Outcrier is near the Imperial Arena.</string>
  <string id="96962" soundid="149652">What is with all these stories about ghosts these days? Has gullibility finally consumed the Empire?</string>
  <string id="96972" soundid="149665"></string>
  <string id="96974" soundid="149667">You... what do you want? Have you come to torture me more? Have you come to see me suffer here unavenged? No one cries for Merchant Bai.</string>
  <string id="96975" soundid="149668">You know of me? You have heard about the pains I suffered in life and this continued torment I have to endure in death?</string>
  <string id="96976" soundid="149669">You... you can understand? You don&apos;t run in terror like the rest. Instead, you talk to me... Perhaps you can help.</string>
  <string id="96977" soundid="149670">I was a merchant in life. Not a rich one, but I made enough to survive. I sold mostly to the poorer sections of the city. My goods weren&apos;t the finest, but they were practical.</string>
  <string id="96978" soundid="149671">At the time, there were a pair of brothers, Si Tsu and Si Ran, who were the terror of the streets. They extorted money and goods from everyone. They tried to extort from me.</string>
  <string id="96979" soundid="149672">When I wouldn&apos;t give them what they wanted, they... they decided to make an example of me. They killed me... and mutilated me... and left me dead in that alley.</string>
  <string id="96980" soundid="149673">They terrorized the city for weeks after that, but they were finally run down. That might have been where it ended, justice done, but it wasn&apos;t....</string>
  <string id="96981" soundid="149674">They were buried here, with me! Their deaths, execution by beheading, were harsh enough that they have risen again!</string>
  <string id="96982" soundid="149675">My spirit cannot rest quiet with them here. Even now, in death, they mock me and torment me as they did in my final moments of life. They drive me mad!</string>
  <string id="96983" soundid="149676">Yes! Yes! If my killers are at last removed from this world, their spirits will no longer torment me! You... you must find a way to defeat them and drive them from this place.</string>
  <string id="96984" soundid="149677">They were common criminals, so they were not given a normal burial. They were dumped in a communal grave underground, to the south. I&apos;m sure you can find them.</string>
  <string id="96985" soundid="149678">Thank you, stranger, if you can truly help me. If... if you do, I&apos;ll show you something that even Shen hasn&apos;t found yet.</string>
  <string id="96986" soundid="149679">They... they were. They caught me in an alley and demanded my goods or my life. My goods *are* my life. How could they take one or the other?</string>
  <string id="96987" soundid="149680">You know nothing, then! Begone if you&apos;re of no help to me!</string>
  <string id="96988" soundid="149681">You... you seek to destroy me, as well? You&apos;re no different from them! But... but I can fight you! And kill you! And I will!</string>
  <string id="96990" soundid="149683">You again? What do you want? To make my suffering and tormented existence even worse? Be gone with you if you&apos;re no help!</string>
  <string id="96991" soundid="149684">Have... have you managed to defeat them at last?</string>
  <string id="96992" soundid="149685">Please, find them and destroy them. They have made my death unbearable, even after they took my life!</string>
  <string id="96993" soundid="149686">Thank you! Thank you! I feel as if a great weight has been lifted from my... er... spirit.</string>
  <string id="96994" soundid="149687">Here, let me show you this.</string>
  <string id="96996" soundid="149689">Something Shen hasn&apos;t found yet. I hope you use it well, and... thank you.</string>
  <string id="96998" soundid="149691">This is all that binds me to this tormented existence! Please, stranger, find them and destroy them so they torment me no longer!</string>
  <string id="96999">You are Merchant Bai?</string>
  <string id="97000">Tell me what is bothering you.</string>
  <string id="97003">What did you do?</string>
  <string id="97007">If I help you, will you rest peacefully?</string>
  <string id="97011">Where can I find them?</string>
  <string id="97012">If you&apos;re mad, I&apos;ll just destroy you.</string>
  <string id="97013">So they killed you?</string>
  <string id="97014">I heard they were killed as well.</string>
  <string id="97016">I really don&apos;t care about your problems.</string>
  <string id="97017">I really don&apos;t care what&apos;s wrong with you.</string>
  <string id="97019">Why are you causing trouble here?</string>
  <string id="97020">I&apos;ve been paid by Shen to put you down.</string>
  <string id="97023">I haven&apos;t found them yet.</string>
  <string id="97025">I have defeated them.</string>
  <string id="97030">If you don&apos;t go back, your master will starve.</string>
  <string id="97031">I don&apos;t have time for this right now.</string>
  <string id="97033">It&apos;s the truth.</string>
  <string id="97037">Forgive her.</string>
  <string id="97044">You two can make up on your own time.</string>
  <string id="97045">I&apos;ll just leave you two alone for a bit.</string>
  <string id="97047">If you can&apos;t accept the truth, then there is no hope for you.</string>
  <string id="97048">I won&apos;t let you.</string>
  <string id="97051">Take her, then.</string>
  <string id="97055">Then I&apos;ll end both of yours!</string>
  <string id="97058">The fish is mightier than the sword.</string>
  <string id="97060" soundid="150010">My family would have named him after... after I passed beyond. Shen must know, or there must be some way to find him. I remember so little since I... I passed away.</string>
  <string id="97061" soundid="150011">He was my darling child. My only son. I had planned to name him... I... I don&apos;t remember what it was. So much of the past is unclear to me now.</string>
  <string id="97062" soundid="150012">I remember... There was an... aunt? An uncle? Or was it his father? I... I don&apos;t remember it any clearer than that. Every time I try to grasp it, it slips away.</string>
  <string id="97063" soundid="150013">I&apos;d... I&apos;d have to see his grave. I&apos;d have to see it with my own eyes. And look inside... If he was dead, if he was here, I&apos;d see the tiny spark of his spirit there, calling to me.</string>
  <string id="97064" soundid="150014">But... if it isn&apos;t... if it isn&apos;t him. I&apos;m so close to breaking completely now. The madness that has overtaken all the other ghosts here has its claws in me as well.</string>
  <string id="97065" soundid="150015">My despair is so great that if you lie, if you prove false, then all hope would be lost, and I fear I would descend into madness from which there is no return.</string>
  <string id="97066" soundid="150016">Are... are you sure? I know I wouldn&apos;t be able to stand it if I was separated from him again. Please don&apos;t let this madness consume me. Are you sure it is the right grave?</string>
  <string id="97068" soundid="150018">I... I cannot read. Which... which one is he?</string>
  <string id="97070" soundid="150020">This... this is a woman! Who is this woman?</string>
  <string id="97071" soundid="150021">You... you lied to me after all! Everyone... everyone lies and takes my precious things away!</string>
  <string id="97072" soundid="150022">I... I can&apos;t take... this....</string>
  <string id="97075" soundid="150025">This... this boy... he is not mine. He is not related to me!</string>
  <string id="97077" soundid="150027">This... this old man. He can&apos;t be my son!</string>
  <string id="97078">You&apos;re Miss Chan?</string>
  <string id="97081">What has Shen done with your baby?</string>
  <string id="97083">Your baby is dead, Miss Chan.</string>
  <string id="97084">Whether you like it or not, he&apos;s dead.</string>
  <string id="97087">What can you tell me about your baby?</string>
  <string id="97090">How would I prove your baby is here?</string>
  <string id="97093">I think I know which grave belongs to your baby.</string>
  <string id="97094">Yes. I&apos;ll show you.</string>
  <string id="97096">This is him. Chan Han.</string>
  <string id="97102">This is him. Chan Li.</string>
  <string id="97105">This is him. Chan Deng.</string>
  <string id="97108">This is him. Chan Tuo.</string>
  <string id="97113">I need more time to think about it.</string>
  <string id="97114">I&apos;ll look for your baby.</string>
  <string id="97115">How can I prove to you that he is dead?</string>
  <string id="97116">I&apos;ll go out and look, then.</string>
  <string id="97118">How can I help you find your baby?</string>
  <string id="97119">Your baby was a boy?</string>
  <string id="97121">I&apos;ll speak with Shen.</string>
  <string id="97123">You&apos;re dead. You know that, right?</string>
  <string id="97125">Shen has paid me to put you to rest, spirit.</string>
  <string id="97126">I&apos;m putting you down. Now.</string>
  <string id="97128">How can I prove to you that your baby is dead?</string>
  <string id="97129">I haven&apos;t found your baby yet.</string>
  <string id="97130">I don&apos;t care about your dumb ox!</string>
  <string id="97145">[Intuition] The other ox will be lonely if you don&apos;t go back.</string>
  <string id="97177">Student</string>
  <string id="97219">Get out of here, or I&apos;ll kill the other ox myself!</string>
  <string id="97224" soundid="151287">Thank you for getting rid of that... thing. Business is bad enough without that ogre scaring away my customers.</string>
  <string id="97225" soundid="151288">Here&apos;s a little something to thank you. It&apos;s not much, but it&apos;s about all I can afford these days.</string>
  <string id="97255" soundid="151805">We are here. Have you any other directions? Perhaps I should sweep the ground before you walk on it.</string>
  <string id="97256" soundid="151806">Please, Princess. This slavery is bad enough without you making light of it.</string>
  <string id="97270" soundid="151807">I would agree.</string>
  <string id="97271">I... I&apos;m very sorry... Zi Bao got away.</string>
  <string id="97272">Get out of here!</string>
  <string id="97273">Here it is!</string>
  <string id="97308">I should have known that wouldn&apos;t work?</string>
  <string id="97309">Ha! That was a good one.</string>
  <string id="97310">I&apos;ve been practicing!</string>
  <string id="97311">Feel my sting!</string>
  <string id="97312">Let&apos;s go!</string>
  <string id="97313">I&apos;ll win this one!</string>
  <string id="97314">Time is up for you.</string>
  <string id="97323">Aishi</string>
  <string id="97326">Man</string>
  <string id="97588" soundid="150625">Your own ancestors would not approve. The dead do not like to be disturbed.</string>
  <string id="97589" soundid="150626">Ya Zhen: Ah... and another one begins.</string>
  <string id="97593" soundid="151808">What is your next wish, Master?</string>
  <string id="97595" soundid="150632">Please... please. You&apos;ve got to help me. It&apos;s my son!</string>
  <string id="97596" soundid="150633">Oh, it&apos;s terrible. He&apos;s back there behind the arena, and he needs your help.</string>
  <string id="97597" soundid="150634">No... please. Please... my boy is innocent and just needs your help. You&apos;re strong; you can help him!</string>
  <string id="97598" soundid="150635">Thank you... thank you so much. Just follow me.</string>
  <string id="97599" soundid="150636">But... who will help my son?</string>
  <string id="97600">What&apos;s wrong with your son?</string>
  <string id="97601">Sorry, I don&apos;t have time. There are guards nearby who could help.</string>
  <string id="97602">Get away from me, crazy lady.</string>
  <string id="97603">Lead on. It sounds like there&apos;s no time to waste.</string>
  <string id="97604">Hold on. Why would you let your son play behind the arena?</string>
  <string id="97605">I don&apos;t have time for this. Leave me alone.</string>
  <string id="97606" soundid="150643">Hey, she did it. I guess we won&apos;t get to slice up the boy after all.</string>
  <string id="97607" soundid="150644">That remains to be seen. Keep the boy... and the woman. We may yet have need of them.</string>
  <string id="97608" soundid="150645">Hold your tongue, or I&apos;ll have it removed... before I kill you. We&apos;ve been looking for you, or someone who looks like you.</string>
  <string id="97609" soundid="150646">Killing Gao the Greater was a very big mistake. We have other leaders and other means. The Guild is not going to just... go away.</string>
  <string id="97610" soundid="150647">Maybe you do, and maybe you don&apos;t. It really doesn&apos;t matter. You fit the description... roughly. That&apos;s all that matters.</string>
  <string id="97611" soundid="150648">We know you just arrived here in the city, and you fit the description... roughly.</string>
  <string id="97612" soundid="150649">I&apos;m just glad we found you first. There&apos;s a lot of people looking for you.</string>
  <string id="97613" soundid="150650">Come on out boys... it&apos;s time to gut this pig!</string>
  <string id="97614" soundid="150651">Yes... I&apos;m afraid my boys need a little... release. You understand I&apos;m sure.</string>
  <string id="97615" soundid="150652">Go slowly boys... make sure you savor the moment.</string>
  <string id="97617">Who are you? What do you want?</string>
  <string id="97618">Let the boy and his mother go!</string>
  <string id="97619">Only cowards use women and children to protect themselves!</string>
  <string id="97621">I don&apos;t know what you&apos;re talking about.</string>
  <string id="97623">What makes you think I killed Gao?</string>
  <string id="97625">Don&apos;t be a fool. If I can kill Gao, I can kill you too.</string>
  <string id="97629" soundid="150666">Hold up a minute there, friend. There&apos;s a fee for passing through. It&apos;s not much, just a few silver will do.</string>
  <string id="97630" soundid="150667">You don&apos;t get it. We&apos;ll get our fee... one way or another. You pay... or you don&apos;t leave.</string>
  <string id="97631" soundid="150668">Because I said so. Is that good enough for you? You pay, or you don&apos;t leave. Got it?</string>
  <string id="97632" soundid="150669">You don&apos;t understand... you&apos;re already here. It doesn&apos;t matter which way you want to go... you pay, or you don&apos;t leave.</string>
  <string id="97633" soundid="150670">We&apos;re not alone neither. We&apos;ve got friends... but if we have to call them over, then the fee goes up. Everybody likes to get paid.</string>
  <string id="97634" soundid="150671">[Failure] Nice try. It&apos;ll take more than that to scare us off.</string>

  <string id="97636" soundid="150673">C&apos;mon. Let&apos;s go find someplace else to collect.</string>
  <string id="97637">Transcribed leaf note</string>
  <string id="97638">A note scribbled by Kang that he copied off of a leaf floating around Lord Lao&apos;s Furnace. It suggests that one of the machine&apos;s configurations may be found in a chest in &quot;the cages of animals kept for sport.&quot;</string>
  <string id="97640">The Test of the Closed Fist</string>
  <string id="97641">I suggest you move along before you get hurt.</string>
  <string id="97642">Why is there a fee?</string>
  <string id="97643">I&apos;ll just head back, then.</string>
  <string id="97645">[Intimidation] Move, or I&apos;ll gladly kill you and your friends. No charge.</string>

  <string id="97653">Gravestones</string>
  <string id="97657" soundid="150771">Yes, of course. I have some very... interesting items now.</string>
  <string id="97658" soundid="150772">Of course, of course. Thank you for your help. Come and see me if you&apos;re interested in more of the same. Good fortune to you.</string>

  <string id="97660">Yes, I own it. Why do you want to know?</string>
  <string id="97661">That&apos;s none of your business.</string>
  <string id="97664">And now you want me to help you, I suppose.</string>
  <string id="97665">What exactly do you want me to do?</string>
  <string id="97670">Enough! Just tell me what you want me to do.</string>
  <string id="97671">It is a little rickety actually.</string>
  <string id="97673" soundid="156182">Begone if you&apos;re of no help to me!</string>
  <string id="97674">Kang&apos;s right, this flyer is the best of its kind.</string>
  <string id="97677">You&apos;ve got a deal.</string>
  <string id="97678">I&apos;ll just be leaving now.</string>
  <string id="97679">I&apos;m not interested right now. Thanks.</string>
  <string id="97680">I&apos;m not interested.</string>
  <string id="97683">Let me see your upgrades.</string>
  <string id="97684">I want to do the next mission.</string>
  <string id="97685">I need to go right now. Goodbye.</string>
  <string id="97688" soundid="150804">Get the prefect home safely and I will reward you well. The prefect has also told me to offer you extra silver for destroying as many of the raiders as you can.</string>
  <string id="97689" soundid="150805">The prefect is anxious to be going. Here&apos;s your wind map, and remember, protect the prefect&apos;s flyer at all costs.</string>
  <string id="97691" soundid="150807">This next mission is close to my heart. My family lives in a remote province some distance from here.</string>
  <string id="97692" soundid="150808">The area has been cut off from the main trade routes due to unusually cold weather and bold pirates. I need you to get supplies to my family.</string>
  <string id="97693" soundid="150809">The prefect was so impressed by your assistance, he&apos;s offered the use of his own flyer. It&apos;s equipped to drop supplies, instead of bombs. It&apos;s slower, but it&apos;s tough.</string>
  <string id="97694" soundid="150810">You&apos;ll have to get the supplies as close to the huts and houses as you can to make it worth your while. Take out as many pirates as you can and I&apos;ll gladly pay you extra.</string>
  <string id="97695" soundid="150811">Remember, drop the supplies as close to the homes as possible. Good luck.</string>
  <string id="97696">I&apos;ve decided it would just be easier to destroy you instead.</string>
  <string id="97697">Pay Gambler Daoshen&apos;s Fee</string>
  <string id="97698">Sweet Poison Lyn is is the back room, past where Qui and the fighters rest up between matches. Speak to her and pay Daoshen&apos;s fee of five hundred silver on his behalf and he&apos;ll happily pay you back.</string>
  <string id="97699">Gambler Daoshen, who runs his game in the common room of the tavern in the Imperial Arena, needs someone to pay a five hundred silver fee to a Guild representative named Sweet Poison Lyn. Once the fee is paid, he&apos;ll be able to safely play for larger stakes.</string>
  <string id="97701">I think I should destroy you and put you to rest.</string>
  <string id="97703" soundid="150819">Excellent work. The prefect is happy to be home safe, no doubt.</string>
  <string id="97704" soundid="150820">You did an excellent job clearing out the raiders as well. You&apos;ll get quite a bit extra for that.</string>
  <string id="97705" soundid="150821">I see you were able to dispatch a few of the raiders on your way. I&apos;ll top up your payment a little for that.</string>
  <string id="97706" soundid="150822">The raiders gave you some trouble, I see, but at least the prefect is safe. Here&apos;s the amount I promised you.</string>
  <string id="97707" soundid="150823">Would you like to see some of my upgrades, or could I interest you in doing another mission for me?</string>
  <string id="97708" soundid="150824">There you are! I was wondering if the pirates or the weather had finally stopped you.</string>
  <string id="97709" soundid="150825">You did an excellent job getting the supplies to the people of my province.</string>
  <string id="97710" soundid="150826">I&apos;m glad you were able to get the supplies there. I only wish you could have gotten more to them.</string>
  <string id="97711" soundid="150827">It seems the mission was almost a complete failure. I fear the people of my province will have to make do until the weather clears.</string>
  <string id="97712" soundid="150828">Thankfully, the pirates will no longer be a problem for them.</string>
  <string id="97713" soundid="150829">If only you could have gotten rid of a few more pirates, but at least you were able to destroy some of them.</string>
  <string id="97714" soundid="150830">The pirates were just too much for you it would seem. I hope my friends and family can resist them a bit longer.</string>
  <string id="97717" soundid="150833">I regret I have no more missions for you, but I&apos;m always here if you require upgrades for your flyer. Thank you again.</string>
  <string id="97718" soundid="150834">Hello again. Would you like to see some upgrades for your flyer?</string>
  <string id="97719" soundid="150835">As you wish. I will be here if you change your mind.</string>
  <string id="97720">Who are you again?</string>
  <string id="97721">Yes, I&apos;d like to hear your proposal.</string>
  <string id="97722">No, I&apos;m still not interested.</string>
  <string id="97730" soundid="156189">Curse it all! The wench betrayed us!</string>
  <string id="97735" soundid="156190">The boy will suffer once we&apos;re done with you! So will she, for that matter.</string>
  <string id="97736">Take the Fee to Sweet Poison Lyn</string>
  <string id="97737">With a five hundred silver purse in trust. Go the back room of the Imperial Arena, past the room where the fighters rest up between matches, and speak with Sweet Poison Lyn about Gambler Daoshen.</string>
  <string id="97738">Gambler Daoshen of the Imperial Arena needs a five hundred silver fee taken to Sweet Poison Lyn, a Guild representative, so that he can raise the stakes on his game. You&apos;ve talked Daoshen into giving you the fee up front, and he&apos;s done so in a winnings purse clearly marked as his. This little twist of fate opens up some intriguing possibilities.</string>
  <string id="97758" soundid="150874">And I will take that mishap with the suspended golem as a reminder to always adequately reward you. I would not want our agreement to go sour.</string>
  <string id="97759" soundid="150875">We see them daily at about this time, but they have not arrived yet. Probably delayed in the Necropolis.</string>
  <string id="97760">Is there a shipment of slaves due soon?</string>
  <string id="97761" soundid="150877">Perhaps. They are not often late unless delayed by spirits outside in the Necropolis. Shin makes a point of demanding they be on time.</string>
  <string id="97762">Is there a shipment of slaves due soon?</string>
  <string id="97763">Is there a shipment of slaves due soon?</string>
  <string id="97770" soundid="150897"></string>
  <string id="97771" soundid="158334">I... I don&apos;t believe it! Thank you, mighty one! You have no idea what this means to me.</string>
  <string id="97772" soundid="158335">I have no silver to offer you, but I&apos;ll give you a discount on all the goods I sell. Would you like to see what I have in stock?</string>
  <string id="97773" soundid="158336">I have no silver to offer you, but I&apos;ll give you a discount on all the goods I sell... as soon as the dam is closed and I can replenish my stock.</string>
  <string id="97774" soundid="158337">Tong and his friends are usually off getting drunk near the store houses, past Beggar&apos;s Pier in the southeast end of town. Be careful. I&apos;ve heard they&apos;re good with their fists.</string>
  <string id="97775" soundid="158338">The figurine isn&apos;t worth much, but it belonged to my mother. I wish there was some way to get it back.</string>
  <string id="97776" soundid="158339">Of course. I understand. Your problems, like Sheng&apos;s, are far greater than mine. But, if you should happen to run into Tong, please think of me.</string>
  <string id="97777" soundid="158340">If you convince him to return my mother&apos;s figurine, I&apos;ll give you a discount on all my merchandise when it arrives.</string>
  <string id="97778" soundid="158341">But until Minister Sheng finds someone to close the Great Dam, the river is too low for any trade to come into town, and I can&apos;t replenish my stock.</string>
  <string id="97781">Have you told the authorities about this?</string>
  <string id="97782">This isn&apos;t my problem.</string>
  <string id="97784">I don&apos;t have time for this.</string>
  <string id="97785">I want to ask about something else.</string>
  <string id="97787">I have your figurine here.</string>
  <string id="97789">Where can I find Tong?</string>
  <string id="97790">Maybe you should give it back now.</string>
  <string id="97791">[Charm] Your mother wouldn&apos;t like you taking someone else&apos;s things.</string>
  <string id="97793">[Intuition] The figurine was a gift from Cheung&apos;s own mother.</string>
  <string id="97795">[Intimidation] Give the figurine back, shameless dog!</string>
  <string id="97797">Hey, it&apos;s okay. Don&apos;t cry.</string>
  <string id="97798" soundid="150925">Three years. Three long years of tracing these slavers to their master, only to find that there were more above him.</string>
  <string id="97799" soundid="150926">The consolation lies in finding others who share my goals. I did not expect to be lucky enough to find a friend in this place.</string>
  <string id="97800" soundid="150927">I also found a strong ally, but I&apos;m not sure if the greater consolation lies in your ability, determination, or beauty. I look forward to finding out.</string>
  <string id="97801" soundid="150928">That makes two of us. I&apos;ll keep you informed as we deal with Gao&apos;s masters. They&apos;ll be harder to chase down.</string>
  <string id="97802" soundid="150929">Of course. I wouldn&apos;t dream of breaking you down into components. Treating people like commodities was Gao&apos;s business, not mine.</string>
  <string id="97803" soundid="150930">Oh, I never get ideas, only impressions. Don&apos;t worry about what I will accomplish. Finding Gao was only the beginning.</string>
  <string id="97804" soundid="150931">Why? Because I... we have succeeded at a goal that I&apos;ve been working towards for three years?</string>
  <string id="97805" soundid="150932">I feel fine, but determined. Our work isn&apos;t done, but we&apos;ve taken a small step by removing that stain upon the Empire&apos;s honor.</string>
  <string id="97806" soundid="150933">Fair enough. Don&apos;t worry, I know what lies ahead. I tracked my daughter&apos;s killer for three years, after all.</string>
  <string id="97807" soundid="150934">Now you look here, missy! In my day, we respected our elders! I&apos;m sorry, I can&apos;t do that voice justice. I&apos;m only, what, eight years older than you?</string>
  <string id="97808" soundid="150935">Of course, eight years make a difference when you lose three of them chasing your daughter&apos;s killer.</string>
  <string id="97809" soundid="150936">Gao&apos;s slavers took my daughter, Pinmei, and I was able to follow them. Fortunately, they didn&apos;t cover their tracks. I chased them down, trying to reach her.</string>
  <string id="97810" soundid="150937">I was too late. Pinmei was spirited, and I&apos;m sure she fought them. I believe they decided she was too much trouble and killed her. Five years old... and they ran her through.</string>
  <string id="97811" soundid="150938">I found her dead by the roadside and stopped my pursuit. By the time I cared to continue my chase, the slavers were long gone.</string>
  <string id="97812" soundid="150939">It&apos;s... fine. Thank you for your concern, but for the most part I have come to terms with her death.</string>
  <string id="97813" soundid="150940">There are ways to track men who don&apos;t want to be found. It&apos;s all a matter of time and dedication.</string>
  <string id="97814" soundid="150941">Is that what you&apos;re doing? Chasing after your Master without a thought for the others in your town? Yes, I&apos;ve heard about the attack.</string>
  <string id="97815" soundid="150942">I&apos;m sorry. That wasn&apos;t fair. You&apos;re right. I could have saved myself three years if I&apos;d just run those bastards down.</string>
  <string id="97816" soundid="150943">Why dwell on this? Gao is dead, and perhaps Pinmei has found some peace. That&apos;s what really matters. That and what we still have to accomplish.</string>
  <string id="97817" soundid="150944">You&apos;re right, but we have to pick our time, and now isn&apos;t it. We can talk about this later </string>
  <string id="97818" soundid="150945">We&apos;ll talk about Gao later. We have much to do, and none of it will be accomplished if we stand here hashing over the past.</string>
  <string id="97819" soundid="150946">That wasn&apos;t my intent! I don&apos;t even remember how we got on to the subject of Pinmei!</string>
  <string id="97820" soundid="150947">I almost never talk about her, and then I open up to you and you throw it in my face. Let&apos;s just... forget it and get on with what we&apos;re doing.</string>
  <string id="97821" soundid="150948">All right. If you want to bring it up again, it might do me some good to talk, but we do have more important matters right now.</string>
  <string id="97822" soundid="150949">I should apologize. I can be sensitive about my daughter, and your comment that I was &quot;whining&quot; touched a nerve, but I shouldn&apos;t have snapped at you.</string>
  <string id="97823" soundid="150950">That would be best. I don&apos;t normally hold a grudge; hunting Gao for three years was a unique circumstance.</string>
  <string id="97824" soundid="150951">I don&apos;t think of you as one likely to accuse me of whining, but we&apos;re all full of surprises, aren&apos;t we?</string>
  <string id="97825" soundid="150952">I&apos;ll note that. I wouldn&apos;t want you getting too much of an advantage. Your smile&apos;s already distracting enough.</string>
  <string id="97826" soundid="150953">You have an odd way of handling people, but we all have our quirks.</string>
  <string id="97827" soundid="150954">Thank you. I&apos;m pretty resistant to most jokes at my expense, but some subjects....</string>
  <string id="97828" soundid="150955">I never really answered your question about how I tracked Gao down. It&apos;s not that bad a story, if you still want to hear it.</string>
  <string id="97829" soundid="150956">I&apos;ll make you a deal: If you start to look bored, I&apos;ll throw in a Lotus Assassin or two to spice things up.</string>
  <string id="97830" soundid="150957">I lost the men who murdered my daughter, but there are other ways to track men besides following their footprints, something I know all too well.</string>
  <string id="97831" soundid="150958">Eight years ago, when my wife passed away giving birth to Pinmei, I decided to settle down. Before that, my life was less... stable.</string>
  <string id="97832" soundid="150959">You should have seen Pinmei&apos;s mother fight. We met because we both liked to operate outside of the law.</string>
  <string id="97833" soundid="150960">Curses, you&apos;ve uncovered my secret. Actually, the truth isn&apos;t far off. My wife and I met because we both operated outside of the law.</string>
  <string id="97834" soundid="150961">Not every girl likes pompous nobles or stuffy scholars. She and I saw eye-to-eye on many things, including living life to the fullest.</string>
  <string id="97835" soundid="150962">You would have liked her if you&apos;d met her. As long as she wasn&apos;t slipping through the upper window of your house to steal all your valuables.</string>
  <string id="97836" soundid="150963">You remind me of her. Though, she was flighty where you are intense, and she fought with nothing approaching your skill. You also don&apos;t burgle people&apos;s houses.</string>
  <string id="97837" soundid="150964">Not really. She was a wonderful woman, but she was taken from me long ago. I meant the comparison as a compliment.</string>
  <string id="97838" soundid="150965">I called in a lot of favors tracking down Gao, but you never know.</string>
  <string id="97839" soundid="150966">As I followed the trail of various slave-trading rings, I started seeing connections. Strangely enough, all of them seemed tied to the Lotus Assassins.</string>
  <string id="97840" soundid="150967">They would observe. They would ask the same questions I had, but they did nothing.</string>
  <string id="97841" soundid="150968">Every slave-trading ring I saw, the Assassins were at least aware of.</string>
  <string id="97842" soundid="150969">Apparently not. They seemed to be aware of all of these slave rings, and yet they did nothing about them.</string>
  <string id="97843" soundid="150970">I started drawing conclusions, and when I heard that Gao the Greater was dealing heavily with them, I started looking into him.</string>
  <string id="97844" soundid="150971">By approaching it from the top down--Assassins to Gao to slavers--I managed to piece together his involvement and learn the location of his base.</string>
  <string id="97845" soundid="150972">I don&apos;t have an answer to that, though I would very much like to know. If they support these slavers....</string>
  <string id="97846" soundid="150973">My home was not far from Tien&apos;s Landing, so I am certain that it was Gao&apos;s men who took my daughter.</string>
  <string id="97847" soundid="150974">Meeting you, and being given this chance to take the fight higher, I&apos;m glad I chased that bastard down.</string>
  <string id="97848" soundid="150975">It&apos;s good to be here. There&apos;s much ahead of us, but at least we have allies... and friends.</string>
  <string id="97849" soundid="150976">That will make the road easier. Speaking of which, we should keep moving, don&apos;t you think?</string>
  <string id="97850" soundid="150977">You&apos;re right! We should keep moving while we still have surprise on our side.</string>
  <string id="97851" soundid="150978">I know. There&apos;s some peace in Gao&apos;s death, but not enough. People are still being taken as slaves, and much worse happening in this Empire. I won&apos;t forget that.</string>
  <string id="97852" soundid="150979">Fair enough. Ask me later, if you still want to hear about it.</string>
  <string id="97853" soundid="150980">If you&apos;re not interested, that&apos;s fine by me. We have plenty of other things to do than to stand around and talk.</string>
  <string id="97854" soundid="154933">Good luck. Third Brother is worthy opponent. Do not underestimate him.</string>
  <string id="97855">How does that make you feel?</string>
  <string id="97856">How long were you searching for him?</string>
  <string id="97858">I look forward to hearing which of those you settle on.</string>
  <string id="97859">For us to be allies, you have to accept the whole package.</string>
  <string id="97860">Don&apos;t get any ideas. You&apos;re only here because you&apos;re useful.</string>
  <string id="97861">You&apos;re not going to fall into a depression on me, are you?</string>
  <string id="97862">You&apos;re right. That&apos;s a reason to celebrate.</string>
  <string id="97863">I just want you focused. We have a long road ahead of us.</string>
  <string id="97864">Well, it can happen to men your age. They start acting odd when their youth slides away.</string>
  <string id="97866">How did you track Gao?</string>
  <string id="97869">That&apos;s terrible. I&apos;m sorry to bring this up.</string>
  <string id="97871">How did you eventually catch up with them?</string>
  <string id="97873">You should have chased them down. Vengeance is more effective than sorrow.</string>
  <string id="97876">Things like this are important to dwell upon.</string>
  <string id="97878">You still haven&apos;t told me how you found Gao.</string>
  <string id="97879">Are you going to whine about your daughter every time I talk to you?</string>
  <string id="97881">I don&apos;t really feel like talking about this right now.</string>
  <string id="97883">It was a harsh thing for me to say. I apologize as well.</string>
  <string id="97884">Let&apos;s call it water under the bridge and forget about it.</string>
  <string id="97886">I didn&apos;t picture you as one likely to apologize.</string>
  <string id="97887">I like to keep people on their toes. It keeps them honest.</string>
  <string id="97890">I shouldn&apos;t tease you. I was wrong to call you a whiner.</string>
  <string id="97892">One last surprise: I don&apos;t really care about your past. Let&apos;s drop the subject.</string>
  <string id="97893">Snap or not, I doesn&apos;t really matter to me.</string>
  <string id="97894">I&apos;d be quite interested.</string>
  <string id="97895">Tell me, but it had better be exciting.</string>
  <string id="97898">It seemed odd that a doting father would have your skills.</string>
  <string id="97900">I&apos;ve got it! You were raised by a traveling circus troupe.</string>
  <string id="97902">How did you meet your wife if your life was so chaotic?</string>
  <string id="97904">Don&apos;t you feel strange comparing me to your dead wife?</string>
  <string id="97905">Your connections in the underworld tracked down Gao?</string>
  <string id="97906">Could the people you know help us in any way?</string>
  <string id="97908">How were the Assassins connected?</string>
  <string id="97910">What kind of connections did you see?</string>
  <string id="97912">Is there anything they&apos;re not involved with?</string>
  <string id="97915">How do you know Gao&apos;s slavers were the ones who took your daughter?</string>
  <string id="97916">Did you learn anything else? Why are the Assassins ignoring the slave traders?</string>
  <string id="97919">I&apos;m glad I could help, and I&apos;m happy to have your company.</string>
  <string id="97921">Just remember that things will only get harder.</string>
  <string id="97922">Don&apos;t let your anger slip because Gao&apos;s dead. We need that fire.</string>
  <string id="97923">There&apos;s no time to hear it now.</string>
  <string id="97924">I don&apos;t really care about your past. You&apos;re here because you&apos;re useful now.</string>
  <string id="97925" soundid="154934">What are you doing here? Is Master Smiling Hawk... did you deal with him?</string>
  <string id="97926" soundid="154935">But nevertheless... you have chosen the wrong master to follow. I cannot allow you to help Master Smiling Hawk... you will be stopped!</string>

  <string id="97976" soundid="155788">Look, you can&apos;t trust Kai Lan. I know he was probably offering you the world, or maybe all the wine in it, if he were really crafty, but....</string>
  <string id="97977" soundid="155789">You didn&apos;t honestly think you were going to slip down here after that little display, did you, Whirlwind?</string>
  <string id="97978" soundid="155790">Step back, Cho. For once in my life I&apos;ve got something important to tell someone.</string>
  <string id="97979" soundid="155791">You have nothing important to say, you lummox. You&apos;ve embarrassed Kai Lan the Serpent, and I&apos;m going to make sure you never get a chance to repeat your performance.</string>

  <string id="98006" soundid="151389">The Scholars&apos; Garden is a wonder to behold. It is decorated with rocks taken from The Valley of Sprightly Stones. The finest minds in the Empire congregate in the garden.</string>

  <string id="98018" soundid="151401">Was there something else you wanted to discuss?</string>
  <string id="98019" soundid="151402">There&apos;s almost always something happening in the city.</string>
  <string id="98020" soundid="151403">There&apos;s Captain Sen, of course, standing guard at the gates out of the city. Word has it the Captain has some bounties.</string>

  <string id="98022" soundid="151405">You must know about the Imperial Arena. Qui the Promoter is always looking for skilled fighters to participate in his matches. It&apos;s this huge building right here.</string>
  <string id="98023" soundid="151406">There&apos;s word from the Scholars&apos; Garden that some strange Outlander has taken up residence there. Causing quite the ruckus, as barbarians typically do.</string>
  <string id="98024" soundid="151407">There&apos;s a rumor floating around that the Black Leopard School has been having some difficulties recently. Feuding masters, that sort of thing.</string>

  <string id="98026" soundid="151409">Word has it there&apos;s going to be a new play happening some time soon in the Golden Way district. Over at the large pagoda on the left side of the road.</string>
  <string id="98027" soundid="151410">It might not be ready to start yet, but it&apos;s certainly worth keeping an eye out for.</string>
  <string id="98028" soundid="151411">That&apos;s all I can think of right now.</string>
  <string id="98029" soundid="151412">Of course, most of the things I know about are old news before too long. That&apos;s life in the big city for you.</string>
  <string id="98030" soundid="151413">I would be happy to, if you weren&apos;t prone to ask questions that could get us both hauled away for inappropriate discussions.</string>
  <string id="98031" soundid="151414">I know you&apos;re new to the Imperial City, but the Lotus Assassins are everywhere. They do not tolerate treason or sedition, and casual questions can be viewed as such.</string>

  <string id="98033" soundid="151416">I&apos;m sorry, I can&apos;t say I know anyone by that name. Maybe you could look up at the Black Leopard School? Across the waterway and up the grassy path.</string>
  <string id="98034" soundid="151417">That is not funny! We do not discuss... that man. The Emperor&apos;s brothers are a very sensitive subject, and I won&apos;t discuss this further.</string>
  <string id="98035" soundid="151418">Speak with... are you mad? No one simply speaks with Death&apos;s Hand! He is the commander of the Imperial Army, and the Emperor&apos;s most trusted servant!</string>
  <string id="98036" soundid="151419">No, you do not speak with Death&apos;s Hand, and even *presuming* that you are worthy of that honor is considered treason!</string>

  <string id="98052" soundid="154957">Ah... we&apos;re not exactly sure. She came here and just started meditating. That man followed her in and went to speak to her. You can see what happened to him.</string>
  <string id="98053" soundid="151436">Always a pleasure to see you again.</string>
  <string id="98054" soundid="151437">What can I do for the Imperial Champion?</string>
  <string id="98055" soundid="151438">Aren&apos;t you the one who dealt with that Outlander buffoon over in the Scholars&apos; Garden? Well done!</string>
  <string id="98056" soundid="151439">Your victories have certainly pulled many people to the arena recently! Keep up the good work.</string>
  <string id="98057" soundid="151440">Terrifying news about this &quot;Scourge of the South&quot; isn&apos;t it? Ah well, they&apos;ll never reach our city. What can I do for you?</string>
  <string id="98058" soundid="151441">I hope you find our fair city welcoming.</string>
  <string id="98059" soundid="151442">There are several districts within easy walking distance. This area is the Market District, and it is filled with all sorts of merchants and traffic.</string>
  <string id="98060" soundid="151443">If you cross the waterway and turn left, you will soon come to the gate of the Golden Way, a rich and luxurious place.</string>
  <string id="98061" soundid="151444">The Golden Way is connected to both the Scholars&apos; Garden at its far end, and the Necropolis, though no one would venture into those burial grounds without good reason.</string>
  <string id="98062" soundid="151445">Just over there is the Imperial Arena, where you can test your skills in the finest competition in the land or grab a drink at the Heart of the Empire Tavern within.</string>

  <string id="98065">I&apos;ll be going now.</string>

  <string id="98082">Tell me more about the layout of the city.</string>
  <string id="98085">Tell me more about this immediate area.</string>
  <string id="98088">Let&apos;s hear some more about the places off the Golden Way.</string>
  <string id="98090">What of the Lotus Assassins? Where would I find them?</string>
  <string id="98092">[Charm] You can tell me as a favor. I need to know where to be careful, after all.</string>
  <string id="98094">[Intimidation] You refuse to tell me because you think I&apos;m one of their spies? I resent the implication!</string>
  <string id="98096">[Intuition] I brought this up. I&apos;m the one taking the risk here.</string>
  <string id="98099">Forget I asked.</string>
  <string id="98100">That&apos;s all I wanted to know about the city.</string>
  <string id="98101">Do you know of anything happening in the city?</string>
  <string id="98104">Can you think of anything else?</string>
  <string id="98105">What else is going on?</string>
  <string id="98106">Interesting. Is that all you have?</string>
  <string id="98108">Any other word?</string>
  <string id="98110">Any other news?</string>
  <string id="98111">That&apos;s enough happenings for now.</string>
  <string id="98112">Would you be able to help me look for someone?</string>
  <string id="98114">I&apos;m searching for a man called Master Li.</string>
  <string id="98115">Sun Li the Glorious Strategist</string>
  <string id="98117">How would I speak with Death&apos;s Hand?</string>
  <string id="98120">No one important. Let&apos;s move to another topic.</string>
  <string id="98121">I will be back if I have other questions for you.</string>
  <string id="98122" soundid="151809">That&apos;s isn&apos;t a bad idea, Princess. How many times have you ordered some poor servant to do something similar?</string>
  <string id="98123" soundid="151810">That servant likely had at least the illusion of choice.</string>
  <string id="98124" soundid="151811">Here we are again, at the lair of the enemy. I&apos;m surprised I never looked upon the palace with anything other than contempt.</string>
  <string id="98125" soundid="151812">Into the den of the enemy. I like it. I assume you plan to stay this time?</string>
  <string id="98126" soundid="151813">We... are here. I would like our visit to be as brief as possible, but I have the feeling you intend to stay quite a while.</string>
  <string id="98127" soundid="151814"></string>
  <string id="98128" soundid="151815">Well... that was anticlimactic. A flash of light but no resounding boom. What good is such a light if earth doesn&apos;t meet sky?</string>
  <string id="98129" soundid="169824">When you have a moment, we should talk.</string>
  <string id="98130" soundid="151817">What? Oh, my. It seems we have transported to a... a heaven. A strangely familiar one, for some reason, but I don&apos;t recall ever moving to such a place before.</string>
  <string id="98131" soundid="151818">Where have you brought us, Kang? We don&apos;t have time for such games. Get us back to the Imperial City. Now!</string>
  <string id="98132" soundid="151819">I like this mode of travel even less than your flying bug-eyed barrel. Besides, any heaven worth visiting should have us knee-deep in wine... top down.</string>
  <string id="98133" soundid="151820">It is strangely beautiful. We are clearly not in an earthly realm.</string>
  <string id="98134" soundid="151821">Kang! You and your infernal inventions are going to get us all killed.</string>
  <string id="98135" soundid="151822">An interesting little device you have there. It could be useful if you could count on your point of arrival, but since you made it... I&apos;ll stick to walking.</string>
  <string id="98136" soundid="151823">Chai Ka: There are many realms that can be called heavens. This is... a small one, with strange energies.</string>
  <string id="98137" soundid="151824">Crazy old man. This is going to delay us even more.</string>
  <string id="98138" soundid="151825">This place is completely unknown to me... or is it? I am compelled to... to take the steps this way. There are... gears here, that I remember.</string>
  <string id="98139" soundid="151826">Good idea. Something about this place makes me want to explore, too. I am compelled to step this way... there are gears here that I remember.</string>
  <string id="98140" soundid="151827">Hmm... leave you say? Yes, yes, but... there is something I must look at. It is just over here, but how do I know this? Some sort of machine....</string>
  <string id="98141" soundid="151828">Look at this... it&apos;s a marvel... a wonder of monumental proportions... a phenomenal piece of unbelievable craftsmanship.</string>
  <string id="98142" soundid="151829">I haven&apos;t the slightest idea. But it must be important, wouldn&apos;t you think? I mean, just look at it.</string>
  <string id="98143" soundid="151830">These machines... they are manipulators, fabricators. They bully energy into... into something. They can be activated, deactivated, on and off, off and on. You see?</string>
  <string id="98145" soundid="151832">Don&apos;t worry... the individual machines are not activated. I think the switches must be thrown on at least two of the components before it will do... whatever it does.</string>
  <string id="98146" soundid="151833">Well, judging by the pile of ashes I found near the controls, if you do it wrong it either creates a nice warm fire or burns the person standing here to a crisp.</string>
  <string id="98147" soundid="151834">So... you might want to be careful how you go about it. Things like this usually have directions... no, recipes... no, that&apos;s not it. Configurations! That&apos;s it.</string>
  <string id="98154" soundid="151841">That error was... probably to be expected, given the complexity of the furnace.</string>
  <string id="98155" soundid="151842">Excellent. What an amazing machine. Now, if we can find more configurations... just imagine what we could do here.</string>
  <string id="98156" soundid="151843">That same one? But why not try something different? It&apos;s up to you, of course.</string>
  <string id="98157" soundid="151844">Yes, amazing, indeed. Of course, without more configurations, we&apos;ll never know just what it can really do!</string>
  <string id="98158" soundid="151845">Very well. In the meantime, I will try to see if I can learn anything more about this interesting machine. I can always bring us back here later.</string>
  <string id="98165" soundid="169825">Sorry if I was lagging behind. I was lost in my own thoughts, it seems.</string>
  <string id="98166" soundid="169826">If you ever have something on your mind, I&apos;m happy to lend an ear.</string>
  <string id="98167" soundid="169827">Next time you need a break, boy, have I got a story for you.</string>
  <string id="98168" soundid="169828">Did I ever tell you about the time...? Oh, no, I didn&apos;t.</string>
  <string id="98169" soundid="169829">I just remembered this time where... well, I&apos;ll tell you about it later, if you want.</string>
  <string id="98170" soundid="169830">Do you have a moment to talk?</string>
  <string id="98171">Have you identified any more configurations for the machine?</string>
  <string id="98173">Patron</string>
  <string id="98176">Patron</string>
  <string id="98177">Take me back to the furnace.</string>
  <string id="98178">What do you think about our current situation?</string>
  <string id="98181" soundid="169831">I&apos;ve been thinking, and... well, we&apos;ll talk when you have time.</string>
  <string id="98184">It doesn&apos;t matter. Just activate it.</string>
  <string id="98185">I&apos;m sure that will help. Start it up.</string>
  <string id="98186">Wait, I don&apos;t want to do this yet.</string>
  <string id="98190">I&apos;m ready to go. Call everyone to the flyer.</string>
  <string id="98192">I wanted to speak with you.</string>
  <string id="98195">I&apos;ll be ready soon.</string>
  <string id="98199">Keep your guard up. This won&apos;t be as easy as last time.</string>
  <string id="98201">Enough! Everyone just follow my lead!</string>
  <string id="98204">&quot;Her will?&quot; Is it the Water Dragon spirit?</string>
  <string id="98207">Techniques</string>
  <string id="98208">Don&apos;t worry. I&apos;ll make sure there are no surprises this time.</string>
  <string id="98210">Be quiet! Keep focus and fight when I say!</string>
  <string id="98216">What now? I have heard enough from the spirit world!</string>
  <string id="98224">Um... where are we?</string>
  <string id="98225">Whatever it was supposed to do, it did it.</string>
  <string id="98226" soundid="169832">It&apos;s funny what comes to mind at times like this. If you ever need to talk, I&apos;m here.</string>
  <string id="98227" soundid="169833">There&apos;s something I should tell you.</string>
  <string id="98229">So, you don&apos;t know where we are?</string>
  <string id="98230">Let&apos;s have a look around here.</string>
  <string id="98231">I want to leave here, Kang.</string>
  <string id="98232">Really? What does it do?</string>
  <string id="98234">Quit your jabbering, Kang, and just tell me what it does!</string>
  <string id="98237">Touch nothing!</string>
  <string id="98238">Please don&apos;t randomly hit switches. I find it unsettling.</string>
  <string id="98239">[sigh] Here we go again.</string>
  <string id="98240">Do you think it&apos;s wise to play with it?</string>
  <string id="98242">We still don&apos;t even know what it does.</string>
  <string id="98244">I just want to head back to where we were.</string>
  <string id="98250">I want to try that again.</string>
  <string id="98252">This machine is amazing!</string>
  <string id="98254">I&apos;m ready to leave this place.</string>
  <string id="98256" soundid="151943">Leaving so soon? Oh well, back to my training.</string>
  <string id="98449">Lotus Assassin</string>

  <string id="98458">Lotus Assassin</string>
  <string id="98461" soundid="152148">What should we have done? Gao killed this boy in one blow. Where were you to defend him?</string>
  <string id="98462" soundid="152149">Gao the Lesser would have said the same thing. If you&apos;re so keen to copy him, you should head for the gate to the marshes as well. That&apos;s the direction he headed.</string>
  <string id="98463" soundid="152150">The murderer was dragging some sort of heavy sack behind him. Go catch him, if you even care.</string>
  <string id="98464">Not one of you had the spine to try and stop him? Typical peasants.</string>
  <string id="98465">Do not question me. If this student could not defend himself, he deserved his fate.</string>
  <string id="98497">The defeat of Sun Li signaled a new beginning for the Jade Empire, but it brought little personal comfort to Dawn Star. She was conflicted: the father she never knew had been her mentor all along, but had also never truly existed, his caring nature just a lie to hide darker intentions. Her search for peace of mind took her back to the simpler life of a borderland village much like Two Rivers, where she built her own school in the manner of the Master she had believed in. The schemes of Sun Li died in the palace, but the teachings of her cherished Master would persevere. At least in this, the man Dawn Star had hoped to know would live on with her.</string>
  <string id="98498">Though the credibility of her family was understandably marred by the actions of her father and uncle, Princess Sun Lian emerged from the incident with a newfound credibility that easily secured her claim to the throne. This was thanks in no small part to keeping &lt;FullName&gt; very close at hand, and making sure the people knew that &lt;he/she&gt; had her full support throughout the ordeal. Empress Sun Lian ruled over a new golden age of the Jade Empire that seemed like it would never end.</string>
  <string id="98499">Drastic shifts in power always create political and economic turbulence. In the years following the defeat of Emperor Sun Li, however, things were remarkably calm, with food supplies reaching the poor and Imperial control of areas abandoned to near-lawlessness quickly restored. Those who were there credit the smooth transition to the aid of a group called the Guild. Working under some mysterious Imperial sanction, the Guild&apos;s agents moved supplies quickly to those who needed them most and helped the Imperial Army pinpoint the camps of bandit leaders and others who threatened Imperial control. While the Guild faded from sight as peace was restored, stories persisted. Most stories recounted the exploits of this mysterious organization&apos;s dashing new leader, Sky. His ready smile, endless energy and kindness quickly made him a legend among the common people.</string>
  <string id="98500">After the power of the Water Dragon was restored, Death&apos;s Hand was sustained by &lt;FullName&gt;&apos;s force of will. Some considered this cruel, and to Death&apos;s Hand it was just continued enslavement, but in the weeks that followed, the influence that had corrupted him began to fade, and a semblance of self returned. For the first time in decades, Death&apos;s Hand felt something other than rage; sadness for how he, as Sun Kin, had helped attack Dirge so long ago. Acceptance of this changed him, and he wandered the Empire seeking redemption. No longer bound to Sun Li&apos;s armor, he wore it anyway, a symbol not of the monster he was forced to be, but of the monster he had not recognized within himself.</string>
  <string id="98501">The defeat of Sun Li signaled a new beginning for the Jade Empire, and for the lives of &lt;FullName&gt; and Dawn Star. They had faced much together, and Dawn Star looked forward to the peace their efforts had brought. In the ensuing years she worked to make the Empire a gentle place that cared for all people equally. The land was not always free of strife, but &lt;FullName&gt; and Dawn Star always tried to find a common ground for all concerned. They lived long and well, and all of the Jade Empire remembers their names.</string>
  <string id="98502">The defeat of Sun Li signaled a new beginning for the Jade Empire, and for the lives of &lt;FullName&gt; and Dawn Star. Despite the victory, Dawn Star was conflicted: she was changed by the journey and by &lt;FullName&gt;&apos;s insistence that she be more aggressive. She felt at odds with the new peace, so she and her Spirit Monk companion eventually left the restructuring of the Empire to others and sought more adventurous climes. They never settled down, preferring to call all of the Jade Empire their home.</string>
  <string id="98503">The defeat of Sun Li signaled a new beginning for the Jade Empire, and for the lives of &lt;FullName&gt; and Dawn Star. Despite their victory, Dawn Star was conflicted: The father she never knew had been her mentor all along, but he had also never truly existed, his caring nature just a lie to hide darker intentions. It was difficult to put that aside, but the stability of her relationship with &lt;FullName&gt; let her see that such dishonesty was the exception, not the rule. In the years that followed they worked together to make their homeland a better place. They lived long and well, and all of the Jade Empire remembers their names.</string>
  <string id="98504">Though the credibility of her family was understandably marred by the actions of her father and uncle, Princess Sun Lian emerged from the incident with a newfound credibility that easily secured her claim to the throne. This was thanks in no small part to keeping &lt;FullName&gt; very close at hand. He was welcomed as her companion, and eventually as Emperor at her side. Together they would rule over a new golden age that seemed like it would never end..</string>
  <string id="98505">Princess Sun Lian was praised for helping save the Empire, and with &lt;FullName&gt; close at hand she was soon appointed Empress. It became apparent, however, that she still held the same disdain for the bonds imposed by her position. &lt;FullName&gt; had pushed her to revel in the traits she showed as Silk Fox, and now that freedom seemed further away than ever. She withdrew, much as her father had done, and soon even an audience in the palace was a rare event. In truth, she was spending much of her time in the streets of the Imperial City, hiding her face once more. Her rule was prosperous enough, but it was never more than a game to her and &lt;FullName&gt;.</string>
  <string id="98506">Though the credibility of her family was understandably marred by the actions of her father and uncle, Princess Sun Lian emerged from the incident with a newfound credibility that easily secured her claim to the throne. This was thanks in no small part to keeping &lt;FullName&gt; very close at hand, and making sure the people knew that she had her full support throughout the ordeal. Empress Sun Lian and &lt;FullName&gt; ruled in concert, remaining close companions and sharing the burden of leadership as they guided the Jade Empire through a new golden age.</string>
  <string id="98507">Shortly after the death of its leader, Gao the Greater, the Guild quickly found itself with a new man at the top and its attention turning sharply away from the slave trade. Sky would quickly deny any involvement in such a thing, and despite their suspicions, most people accepted that only one woman would ever know the full truth. If little else, Sky was always clear on one subject: his undying love for &lt;FullName&gt;. The couple&apos;s exploits and their devotion to each other were the stuff of legend. As they so often do, the tales outgrew the people, and the couple quietly withdrew from the public eye. Where they are now, few can say, but there is a small, unmarked grave in the farmlands outside Tien&apos;s Landing that finds itself adorned with flowers once a year without fail.</string>
  <string id="98508">For a time, Sky found peace, but there was always a question in his heart about what could have been if only &lt;FullName&gt; had seized the power of the Water Dragon. Plagued with uncertainty, Sky turned back to the life he had known before, descending into the underworld to wage a bloody campaign against the leaders of the Guild. His victory was short lived, however, as Sky grew careless with his life and noticed too late the acrid taste of his poisoned wine. Some say he struggled to say something as he fell, maybe a name, but in the end, Sky died alone.</string>
  <string id="98509">Never one to pass up an opportunity, Sky quickly established himself as a replacement for Gao the Greater, seizing control of the leaderless Guild and quickly turning the organization into something he deemed &quot;respectable.&quot; While hardly paragons of society, the members of the Guild were brutally effective in stamping out much of the slave trade. Sky and &lt;FullName&gt; remained constant companions, and neither of them could find it in their heart to ever really settle down. Tales of their exploits are still told, growing more fantastic with each repetition.</string>
  <string id="98510">After Sun Li&apos;s defeat, Kang the Mad was in great demand. There was a new Empire to fortify, and &lt;FullName&gt; had Kang working around the clock. In time, however, Kang grew to resent how his devices were used. He felt that, similar to the flyers he had made for Gao the Greater, duplicates inherently diminished the effectiveness of them all. Kang became reclusive, and eventually an explosion at his main factory appeared to take his life (and that of anyone that might have known his trade secrets). Occasionally there were reports of strange devices appearing on the borderlands of the Empire, but by the time any of &lt;FullName&gt;&apos;s forces could arrive, any trace had disappeared.</string>
  <string id="98511">End Game Screen - Evil Ending - Black Whirlwind.</string>
  <string id="98512">Not all destinies serve heaven. Heaven, too, can be caught in a larger, more malignant fate. Chai Ka the Heavenly Gate Guardian fulfilled his destiny, but he failed in the eyes of heaven. Cast out from the Celestial Bureacracy, he wandered as a tormented demon, bereft of purpose. 

His anchor, the child Wild Flower, also wandered. Sustained by the celestial powers that gave her rebirth, she knew life but not death. Forever a child in body, she saw the wasteland her homeland had become and cursed the fate that made it so.</string>
  <string id="98513">The birth of a new god is a time of infinite possibility. Anything can be accomplished by those with the will to seize it. Ya Zhen was a prisoner in the body of the child Wild Flower, but his master&apos;s ascension freed him. The ways of fate and power are fickle, and he backed the winning side. With &lt;FullName&gt;&apos;s power growing, he could serve no better master. This mortal with the heart of a true god would not last forever. Someday the demon&apos;s time will come again.</string>
  <string id="98514">Bound to &lt;FullName&gt;&apos;s will, Death&apos;s Hand served the new Empire wherever the face of terror was needed to quell dissention. Infused by the ever growing power of his master, his physical form was eventually corrupted beyond what his armor could contain, and he became something... other. Much to &lt;FullName&gt;&apos;s approval, as the new form proved far more efficient at instilling fear. Besides, those allowed to comment agreed that the symbolism of trapping him within his brother&apos;s armor had always seemed somewhat quaint.</string>
  <string id="98515">The defeat of Sun Li signaled the rise of &lt;FullName&gt;, and at his side stood Dawn Star. She was devoted to his efforts; he had convinced her that the only valid response to adversity is an adequately forceful reply. Only a firm hand could prevent another tyrant coming to power, and no one was more suited than the Spirit Monk she had helped ascend. Dawn Star became a tempering influence, and made certain that the people of the Empire had their needs met, if not all of their wants. Their Empire, as long as it lasted, was strong and prosperous.</string>
  <string id="98516">The defeat of Sun Li signaled the rise of &lt;FullName&gt;, and Dawn Star was ever at his side. She was devoted to his efforts, but personal turmoil clouded her mind. She had found her lost father, but Sun Li was not the man she had wanted him to be. It was as if he had killed her true father, the idealized Master Li that now only existed in her memories. She grew cold over time, and without her tempering influence, the Jade Empire became a demanding place to live, controlled through force of arms. But the tighter the reigns, the harder the resistance, and the reigns were very tight indeed. Dawn Star would stand by &lt;FullName&gt; to the end.</string>
  <string id="98517">In the wake of Sun Li&apos;s defeat, &lt;FullName&gt; assumed control of the Empire. Princess Lian lent the new emperor legitimacy through her family line, and as Emperor and Empress they turned a chaotic and fractured land into an economic and military powerhouse. Anyone who challenged their rule awakened a fury that not even the gods could contain, and even whispered secrets earned quick reprisals. Empress Lian continued to prowl as the shadowy Silk Fox, but unbeknownst to those who had encountered the supposed outlaw, this new version was dedicated to maintaining the new order. Much as Death&apos;s Hand had served her father, she controlled the flow of all information within the Empire. This combination of power and cunning ensured that the reign of &lt;FullName&gt; would be long remembered.</string>
  <string id="98518">After the death of Sun Li, the Princess and &lt;FullName&gt; assumed control. They quickly crushed any opposition to the partnership they formed, and turned a chaotic and fractured land into an economic and military powerhouse. Anyone that threatened the stability of their Empire awakened a fury not even the gods could contain. It became dangerous to speak against them even in the lowliest of taverns, and Sun Lian and &lt;FullName&gt; were often amused that, despite the power they could command, their enemies were often more afraid of the shadowy Silk Fox that could now somehow be in two places at once. Even at their height of their power they made time for such games they both enjoyed.</string>
  <string id="98519">What does it take for a mortal to hold the affections of a god? Sky&apos;s dedication to his love never wavered, and he stood proudly at her side, enforcing her will without question. Over the years, his name became more dreaded than Death&apos;s Hand, for Sky worked in the shadows, and his informants were everywhere. There were moments when Sky would lie alone in the middle of the night--for no god needs sleep--and he would question the path his life had taken. It was invariably on those nights that the Empress would find time to come to him, and the next day would always find more steel in his eyes and a dark resolve burning in his heart.</string>
  <string id="98520">What does it take for a mortal to hold the affections of a god? Sky&apos;s dedication never wavered, and he stood proudly at the side of the Spirit Monk who had risen to become a living god. Together they ruled an empire enslaved by fear; never before had history seen such a combination of overt power and subversive guile. When all men can be convinced to cast suspicious eyes upon their brothers, perfect control is possible, even if such a balance can only be maintained for short time.</string>
  <string id="98521">End Game Screen - TITLE</string>
  <string id="98522">Emperor</string>
  <string id="98543" soundid="152352">You&apos;re going to pay back Death&apos;s Hand for all that he&apos;s done to you, to us. I know you&apos;ll find a way, but still....</string>
  <string id="98544">Student</string>
  <string id="98552">The Other</string>
  <string id="98553" soundid="152272">Is there anything else you need right now?</string>
  <string id="98556" soundid="152275">They showed up shortly after Gao took over, working with him and his Guild. Inquisitor Lim seems to be in charge of the Lotus Assassins here.</string>
  <string id="98557" soundid="152276">Gao and Lim don&apos;t get along... they both like to be in charge. Be careful if you run into Lim. There&apos;s something very wrong about him.</string>
  <string id="98559">Tell me about the Lotus Assassins.</string>
  <string id="98560" soundid="152279">Don&apos;t try to pin your failings on me, Lim! I&apos;ve delivered everything I promised. It&apos;s only a matter of time until I finish the special Dragonfly to transport the artifact to the Imperial City.</string>
  <string id="98561" soundid="152280">Jia is not my Mistress, Lim. And I don&apos;t take orders from you, either! Remember, if not for my son you would never have discovered where the Glorious Strategist was hiding!</string>
  <string id="98562" soundid="152281">I am well aware of your son&apos;s role in all this, Gao. In fact, I suspect I know more about him than you do.</string>
  <string id="98563" soundid="152282">What are you talking about? Have you heard something about young Gao? Tell me!</string>
  <string id="98564" soundid="152283">Of course, Gao. I was just waiting for the perfect time to tell you. I received a report from the destruction of Two Rivers. Your son, Gao the Lesser, is dead.</string>
  <string id="98565" soundid="152284">No! This can&apos;t be! You lie!</string>
  <string id="98566" soundid="152285">I speak the truth. It seems your son was no match for one of the other students. From the condition of his body it sounds like he died quite painfully.</string>
  <string id="98567" soundid="152286">No! Young Gao was everything to me... Damn you and your black heart, Lim! Damn you!</string>
  <string id="98576" soundid="152353">You&apos;ve been the best of companions, and I&apos;ve come to value that in ways I didn&apos;t expect.</string>
  <string id="98577" soundid="152354">You&apos;ve shown me the value of strength, of finding my enemy&apos;s weaknesses before I strike.</string>
  <string id="98578" soundid="152355">You&apos;re not like anyone else. You fight like a demon, and yet you value honor and harmony. So many people would abuse your skills.</string>
  <string id="98579" soundid="152356">Maybe it&apos;s those deep eyes or that glorious hair, but when we first met, your beauty ignited me.</string>
  <string id="98580" soundid="152357">I find you irresistible. Whenever that beautiful face of yours breaks into a smile, my heart lifts.</string>
  <string id="98581" soundid="152358">I was struck when I first saw you. You are a creature of grace. You belong in heaven, not here on earth.</string>
  <string id="98582" soundid="152359">When I learned of your nobility, strength, and honor, I knew you were special.</string>
  <string id="98583" soundid="152360">Then I saw you fight and learned of your quick mind. I knew you were more than just a pretty face.</string>
  <string id="98584" soundid="152361">Then you showed me what it takes to be strong, to take advantage of my enemy&apos;s weaknesses, and I knew you were unique.</string>
  <string id="98585" soundid="152362">What can I say? Your company brings out the best in me.</string>
  <string id="98586" soundid="152363">Think about what you&apos;re planning to do.</string>
  <string id="98587" soundid="152364">Look, I&apos;m trying to tell you that... before you go....</string>
  <string id="98588" soundid="152365">I... want you to be careful.</string>
  <string id="98589" soundid="152366">Well, no.... I just.... Look. You can&apos;t afford to be distracted in there. You go, you win, and we&apos;ll deal with this later, I promise.</string>
  <string id="98590" soundid="152367">Where do you get that incredible courage? I didn&apos;t want to distract you, but you&apos;re one step ahead of me, as always.</string>
  <string id="98591" soundid="152368">Whatever happens in there, I&apos;ll be there for you when this is all over. </string>
  <string id="98592" soundid="152369">Thank you.</string>
  <string id="98593" soundid="152370">You can count on it.</string>
  <string id="98594" soundid="152371">I&apos;m sorry. I&apos;ll... keep my thoughts to myself.</string>
  <string id="98595" soundid="152372">We should get going. Don&apos;t worry about me; I&apos;m just a tongue-tied fool today. Let&apos;s go.</string>
  <string id="98596" soundid="152373">I shouldn&apos;t hold you back. You have a long-overdue debt to repay.</string>
  <string id="98604">You&apos;re not exactly average yourself, Sky.</string>
  <string id="98606">You&apos;re more serious than usual.</string>
  <string id="98608">What are you trying to say?</string>
  <string id="98610">That&apos;s all? Nothing else you wanted to say?</string>
  <string id="98611">That was quite the setup for something Whirlwind might have said. You sure nothing else is on your mind?</string>
  <string id="98612">Careful? I&apos;m about to face the Emperor himself and you think I should be &quot;careful?&quot;</string>
  <string id="98613">If you can&apos;t say it, I will. I love you, Sky.</string>
  <string id="98616">I know what you&apos;re really saying. I&apos;ll be all right.</string>
  <string id="98618">Just be sure you&apos;re ready to say what you really mean when we&apos;re done with the Emperor.</string>
  <string id="98620">I don&apos;t have time for this. If you can&apos;t be honest with me, be silent.</string>
  <string id="98625">Lotus Assassin</string>
  <string id="98628">Lotus Assassin</string>
  <string id="98638" soundid="152423">Things ended on a sour note anyway. Let&apos;s let that moment pass before we return to the subject.</string>
  <string id="98639" soundid="152424">Give me a bit to digest what has happened, and then I promise to regale you with the story of how I found him.</string>
  <string id="98640" soundid="152425">Always happy to help. What do you need?</string>
  <string id="98641" soundid="152426">Sagacious Zu sacrificed himself so that you could continue. That reminded me how dangerous our task truly is.</string>
  <string id="98642" soundid="152427">I hope so, too. He certainly earned a reprieve, if only from hating himself so much.</string>
  <string id="98643" soundid="152428">I don&apos;t think you would have survived Death&apos;s Hand. Even if you had, would you be in any shape to face his master, the Emperor?</string>
  <string id="98644" soundid="152429">You&apos;re growing stronger. You learn new styles with ease and fight like no one I&apos;ve seen. </string>
  <string id="98645" soundid="152430">Your master obviously trained you well, but you have come a long way even since we met. </string>
  <string id="98646" soundid="152431">It&apos;s true, though half of them have come from watching you, and the rest are the result of being desperate to survive, if only to see what happens next.</string>
  <string id="98647" soundid="152432">Would you have kept me around if I hadn&apos;t? If we&apos;re going to depend on each other, we have to be strong.</string>
  <string id="98648" soundid="152433">I&apos;m not sure about that. A skilled master is more interested in ensuring that his pupils learn how to learn rather than drilling them in basic moves.</string>
  <string id="98649" soundid="152434">I agree. If you had been released from the confinement of Two Rivers sooner, you would be even stronger!</string>
  <string id="98650" soundid="152435">I know. Despite the temptations before you, your skills are guided by a sense of honor that would humble Sagacious Tien.</string>
  <string id="98651" soundid="152436">I can imagine. Your capacity for learning new styles and refining those you know is almost superhuman.</string>
  <string id="98652" soundid="152437">I would not wish to stand in your way; that is for certain.</string>
  <string id="98653" soundid="152438">I&apos;m quite sure I will make a point eventually. I usually do after I dance around it for a while, don&apos;t I?</string>
  <string id="98654" soundid="152439">I forget how you value direct speech. I won&apos;t in the future.</string>
  <string id="98655" soundid="152440">I know this seems a strange thing to ask now, of all times, but do you ever wonder what you will do after we rescue your master? </string>
  <string id="98656" soundid="152441">I have my own ideas, but I&apos;d be interested in hearing yours.</string>
  <string id="98657" soundid="152442">I&apos;d rather hear what you have to say, unless you&apos;re going to insist?</string>
  <string id="98658" soundid="152443">What about your master? What do you think will happen with him?</string>
  <string id="98659" soundid="152444">That may prove difficult, but I can think of no one more up to the task.</string>
  <string id="98660" soundid="152445">I would hope you&apos;d be at his side. That would make you the second most powerful man in the Empire.</string>
  <string id="98661" soundid="152446">With yourself at his side, I hope. You would be the most powerful woman in the Empire.</string>
  <string id="98662" soundid="152447">I&apos;ve wondered the same thing, but your master is a strong man.</string>
  <string id="98663" soundid="152448">You&apos;re right, but the longer Dawn Star deludes herself, the more useful she will be to the group.</string>
  <string id="98664" soundid="152449">Are you sure? Master Li&apos;s blood runs the same color as the Emperor&apos;s. Still, you would know him best.</string>
  <string id="98665" soundid="152450">Depending on what it takes to rescue Master Li, that may leave an empty throne in the Imperial Palace. That situation is ripe with opportunity for us all.</string>
  <string id="98666" soundid="152451">That&apos;s fair. Personally, I have high hopes that we will find a way to save your master.</string>
  <string id="98667" soundid="152452">I understand. I think we will be too late to save your master. This will turn into a search for vengeance before the end.</string>
  <string id="98668" soundid="152453">I would keep that from Dawn Star, though. She&apos;ll be more useful to you if she thinks there&apos;s still hope for Master Li.</string>
  <string id="98669" soundid="152454">What about you? Where do you see yourself?</string>
  <string id="98670" soundid="152455">Your students would be rich in skill and spirit from the lessons you could teach.</string>
  <string id="98671" soundid="152456">If your students learned even a tenth of your skill, they would be strong.</string>
  <string id="98672" soundid="152457">You could also find an army of highly trained, devoted followers, if you were so inclined.</string>
  <string id="98673" soundid="152458">No one knew much about them, even when they were around to ask. Your task would not be easy.</string>
  <string id="98674" soundid="152459">But it would be rewarding, and perhaps you could find answers to questions you didn&apos;t even know you had.</string>
  <string id="98675" soundid="152460">They must have possessed great magics to work with the Water Dragon. If you could master their secrets, the earth would tremble where you walk.</string>
  <string id="98676" soundid="152461">A shining blade of vengeance, cutting out the dark heart of this Empire. The poets will never forget you.</string>
  <string id="98677" soundid="152462">I was hoping you would say that. Those who stand in our path deserve no better.</string>
  <string id="98678" soundid="152463">Some sort of holiday? A break from the drudgery of fighting the Empire? You&apos;d get bored.</string>
  <string id="98679" soundid="152464">Depending on the rogue, you may lose an opportunity to take advantage of the Empire&apos;s turmoil.</string>
  <string id="98680" soundid="152465">I can only hope this fellow is possessed of remarkable stamina. I can&apos;t imagine you &quot;settled&quot; for long.</string>
  <string id="98681" soundid="152466">Depending on the rogue, you may find he thinks that &quot;settling&quot; would waste your talents and opportunities for the future.</string>
  <string id="98682" soundid="152467">I wouldn&apos;t presume to know what you will do next, but I know you will follow the path of honor. Whatever that requires.</string>
  <string id="98683" soundid="152468">I wouldn&apos;t guess at what you will do, but I know you will be better for the experience.</string>
  <string id="98684" soundid="152469">If we haven&apos;t already, I know you will avenge the insult the Lotus Assassins have dared to heap upon you.</string>
  <string id="98685" soundid="152470">Allow me a prediction, if you will?</string>
  <string id="98686" soundid="152471">You&apos;re not usually so closed about your goals, but I can respect that. If you&apos;ll permit me, I could make a few guesses.</string>
  <string id="98687" soundid="152472">Someday I&apos;ll enter into your confidence, but for now I can respect your privacy. Would you permit me to hazard a few guesses?</string>
  <string id="98688" soundid="152473">I have high hopes that we will find a way to save your Master.</string>
  <string id="98689" soundid="152474">We both suspect that we will be too late to save your Master. This will turn into a search for vengeance.</string>
  <string id="98690" soundid="152475">I would keep that from Dawn Star, though. She&apos;ll be more useful to you if she thinks there&apos;s still hope for Master Li.</string>
  <string id="98691" soundid="152476">I wouldn&apos;t presume to know what you will do next, but I know you will follow the path of honor. Whatever that requires.</string>
  <string id="98692" soundid="152477">I wouldn&apos;t guess at what you will do, but I know you will be better for the experience.</string>
  <string id="98693" soundid="152478">If we haven&apos;t already, I know you will avenge the insult the Lotus Assassins have dared to heap upon you.</string>
  <string id="98694" soundid="152479">I do not think we will all survive, not against these odds, but those of us who do will find a way to return to our normal lives.</string>
  <string id="98695" soundid="152480">Whatever your ambitions, those of us strong enough to survive what&apos;s ahead will follow you to the end.</string>
  <string id="98696" soundid="152481">When you think about it, that leaves only the question of us, doesn&apos;t it? That&apos;s the tricky one.</string>
  <string id="98697" soundid="152482">Yes, I do.</string>
  <string id="98698" soundid="152483">We&apos;ve talked long enough. As it stands I&apos;m going to have to listen to Whirlwind&apos;s lewd innuendos for the next two days, at least.</string>
  <string id="98699" soundid="152484">I want nothing more than to carry this conversation to its logical conclusion, but we have stood apart from the others long enough.</string>
  <string id="98700" soundid="152485">If I have to listen to that Whirlwind oaf make one lewd comment, I swear I&apos;ll strangle him with his own intestines.</string>
  <string id="98701" soundid="152486">Given what we&apos;re facing, I don&apos;t know if we should go further with this until you rescue your Master. The last thing you need is a distraction.</string>
  <string id="98702" soundid="152487">Good. I&apos;ll look forward to... after.</string>
  <string id="98703" soundid="152488">Trust me, you&apos;re not the only one, but you can&apos;t afford distractions right now.</string>
  <string id="98704" soundid="152489">There will be time later.</string>
  <string id="98705" soundid="152490">There you have it. The easiest answer of this entire journey! Stupefyingly simple.</string>
  <string id="98706" soundid="152491">I have you covered there, Master.</string>
  <string id="98707" soundid="152492">Yes, only a fool.</string>
  <string id="98708" soundid="153740">If it isn&apos;t the champion. You have any idea how many headaches you&apos;ve caused me at this betting counter? How many screaming maniacs are drawn to your fights?</string>
  <string id="98709" soundid="152494">We should carry on, don&apos;t you think? You have great things ahead of you. Let&apos;s go see what they are.</string>
  <string id="98710" soundid="152495">Understood. I&apos;ll do my best not to bother you in the future.</string>
  <string id="98711" soundid="152496">I haven&apos;t been to the Imperial City in a while. I traveled here some time ago in my hunt for Gao. In fact, this is where the hunt began.</string>
  <string id="98712" soundid="152497">I&apos;ve come full circle, and I think it&apos;s time to let go of the past and look forward. We have exciting things ahead of us.</string>
  <string id="98713" soundid="152498">There&apos;s no point in living in the past, either.</string>
  <string id="98714" soundid="152499">More pressing, and more dangerous. What we are attempting... it&apos;s madness. All the more exciting.</string>
  <string id="98715" soundid="152500">There won&apos;t be much time for that sort of diversion, but I can&apos;t help see the potential.</string>
  <string id="98716" soundid="152501">You were the one who asked me if I had anything to say.</string>
  <string id="98717" soundid="152502">Perhaps you should stay focused on finding your master. I&apos;d hate to be a distraction.</string>
  <string id="98718" soundid="152503">In my heart, I know my daughter rests as easily as any spirit now. Whatever happens, I have that. And if we succeed, I know she finds peace.</string>
  <string id="98719" soundid="152504">If I could go back, I don&apos;t know if I would. I&apos;m a different man now, and while I treasure the past, I look forward to the future with the same warmth.</string>
  <string id="98720" soundid="152505">We&apos;ll find a way through any troubles. We&apos;re too resourceful to roll over and die.</string>
  <string id="98721" soundid="152506">Besides seeing what trouble you get yourself into next, you mean?</string>
  <string id="98722" soundid="152507">Never! You left out the part about accumulating vast sums of ill-gotten silver.</string>
  <string id="98723" soundid="152508">If I tire you so, I swear this is the last you will hear about this.</string>
  <string id="98724" soundid="152509">You know, I look forward most to the day when I figure out how to deal with you.</string>
  <string id="98725" soundid="152510">A woman as strong as she is beautiful is rare, but I&apos;ve encountered that combination before. Normally, I&apos;d try to flatter you into my bed, but you....</string>
  <string id="98726" soundid="152511">You&apos;re better than that. You&apos;re a companion and a damn skilled warrior. So I find I never quite know how to deal with you.</string>
  <string id="98727" soundid="152512">See, now you&apos;re flirting with me, and I&apos;m left here stammering.</string>
  <string id="98728" soundid="152513">Where&apos;s the fun in that? As I said, I love a challenge!</string>
  <string id="98729" soundid="152514">It&apos;s the truth. Plain and simple.</string>
  <string id="98730" soundid="152515">Am I? Drat, I don&apos;t even know any more. Like I said, consistently off balance.</string>
  <string id="98731" soundid="152516">I don&apos;t deny your beauty; I just don&apos;t want to treat you like I would... other women. I respect you, and well... Let&apos;s just leave it at that for now.</string>
  <string id="98732" soundid="152517">I&apos;m excited to be back in the city. It feels like we&apos;re one step closer to our goal, but you know that better than anyone.</string>
  <string id="98733" soundid="152518">You brought us to this point, after all. Who else could have gathered this crew or found such a quick way out of Tien&apos;s Landing?</string>
  <string id="98734" soundid="152519">With your charms, any sane man would have. Then again, no sane man would be attempting what we&apos;re about to, so you can draw your own conclusions.</string>
  <string id="98735" soundid="152520">I&apos;m serious about you being the reason we&apos;re all in this, though. Somehow, the impossible doesn&apos;t seem that far off when you&apos;re here.</string>
  <string id="98736" soundid="152521">How do you manage that kind of humility? Some sort of special training?</string>
  <string id="98737" soundid="152522">And there you have it. A simple answer is usually the best.</string>
  <string id="98738" soundid="152523">It&apos;s good to see you still have a sense of humor. Some people mistake dry and boring for humble, and that&apos;s simply no fun. Given what we face, we need all the laughter we can get.</string>
  <string id="98739" soundid="152524">That is your way. For my sake, I hope my strength never falters when you need it.</string>
  <string id="98740" soundid="152525">You don&apos;t usually evaluate people like that, but it&apos;s good to know you find my aid valuable.</string>
  <string id="98741" soundid="152526">I know about your history--your heritage--but does it bother you? Is it something you wish weren&apos;t part of your life?</string>
  <string id="98742" soundid="152527">No, no. I take no offense, and every answer you find seems to leave only more questions. Perhaps the city will be more enlightening.</string>
  <string id="98743" soundid="152528">Regardless, we have an empire to shake up.</string>
  <string id="98744" soundid="152529">I&apos;m not sure I understand all the pressures you face, but I will do what I can to aid you. For one thing, the city awaits us.</string>
  <string id="98745" soundid="152530">Some would shy away if presented with your situation, but you embrace it. This city is in for quite a surprise now that you&apos;ve arrived, I wager.</string>
  <string id="98746" soundid="152531">Let&apos;s go see how much trouble we can cause.</string>
  <string id="98747" soundid="152532">If you want to talk more, we should do so later. I&apos;d like that, but we should go see how much trouble we can cause in the big city.</string>
  <string id="98748" soundid="152533">My apologies. I&apos;ll keep such pryings to myself. After all, we&apos;re too busy for idle talk.</string>
  <string id="98749" soundid="152534">I hear and obey. I shall reserve my tales for those who wish to hear them.</string>
  <string id="98750" soundid="152535">What we face... will not be easy. Whenever you need me, just call, and I will fight by your side.</string>
  <string id="98751" soundid="152536">Companions to the end, we&apos;ll put an end to the wrongs in this world.</string>
  <string id="98752" soundid="152537">Dawn Star has been telling me about Two Rivers, the swamp, and Gao the Lesser.</string>
  <string id="98753" soundid="152538">I was sorry to hear about your town. You&apos;re a woman with a knack for finding trouble.</string>
  <string id="98754" soundid="152539">I didn&apos;t say it was a bad thing! We&apos;re kindred spirits, you and I.</string>
  <string id="98755" soundid="152540">You&apos;d be bored and then complacent. The magical spark in your eyes would dim, and you&apos;d grow old. That&apos;s not really what you want.</string>
  <string id="98756" soundid="152541">Stirring the pot just to see what&apos;s at the bottom, are you? It&apos;s amazing how your eyes dance when you&apos;re thinking about causing a ruckus.</string>
  <string id="98757" soundid="152542">Perhaps not the same words, but I am as guilty as the stable boy in his mistress&apos; bed. In your case, though, I&apos;m making an observation of fact.</string>
  <string id="98758" soundid="152543">I was sorry to hear about your town... and your friends. It brought a question to mind.</string>
  <string id="98759" soundid="152544">There&apos;s something I&apos;ve been meaning to ask you. Why? Seriously. Why are you doing this?</string>
  <string id="98760" soundid="152545">Details aside, you&apos;re fighting the Empire as a whole when you oppose the Lotus Assassins, Death&apos;s Hand, or the Emperor&apos;s will.</string>
  <string id="98761" soundid="152546">I know all about your village and your Master, and that explains some of it. What it doesn&apos;t explain is your drive, your strength. What gives you that?</string>
  <string id="98762" soundid="152547">I wonder if fate cast this burden upon you, or if you rose up on your own to shoulder it? History will probably decide.</string>
  <string id="98763" soundid="152548">A village was destroyed just to capture one man. You&apos;re right, that loss was unnecessary and unforgivable.</string>
  <string id="98764" soundid="152549">Revenge, then? Or perhaps the thought that there&apos;s still more to learn by walking this path?</string>
  <string id="98765" soundid="152550">I know you&apos;re going to follow Silk Fox&apos;s plans to find a way into the Assassins&apos; den. It won&apos;t be easy, but I&apos;m confident we&apos;ll succeed.</string>
  <string id="98766" soundid="152551">It&apos;s what happens after you find a way in that has me worried.</string>
  <string id="98767" soundid="152552">What can I say? You&apos;re a source of constant excitement in my life. I&apos;d hate to lose that.</string>
  <string id="98768" soundid="152553">All kinds. Trust me. Let&apos;s not get too far off topic, though. This is important.</string>
  <string id="98769" soundid="152554">I know, I know, but never in their lair. Never in that place.</string>
  <string id="98770" soundid="152555">I can imagine that might just be the case.</string>
  <string id="98771" soundid="152556">I knew men and women who were drawn to the Lotus Assassins. They went into that place to prove themselves, as you intend to.</string>
  <string id="98772" soundid="152557">And the few who made it back out were... different.</string>
  <string id="98773" soundid="152558">True enough. You&apos;re more likely to take over than kowtow to their demands.</string>
  <string id="98774" soundid="152559">That&apos;s reassuring to hear. I&apos;m afraid of what would happen if they convinced you that their way is right.</string>
  <string id="98775" soundid="152560">They acted like they didn&apos;t know us or just didn&apos;t care if we lived or died. It&apos;s hard to say if there&apos;s even a difference to the Lotus Assassins.</string>
  <string id="98776" soundid="152561">I know. There&apos;s nothing common about you, but still....</string>
  <string id="98777" soundid="152562">That&apos;s... true. It is impressive. If the novices were stronger, they wouldn&apos;t buy into the dogma.</string>
  <string id="98778" soundid="152563">I&apos;m not sure if I agree. People work best when they do something they want to do, not something they&apos;re forced to do.</string>
  <string id="98779" soundid="152564">I know you&apos;ll be fine. The Assassins will be lucky if you don&apos;t bring the place down around their ears. Just be sure not to tip your hand before you&apos;re ready.</string>
  <string id="98780" soundid="152565">That&apos;s all in the future, though. We should keep at what we&apos;re doing. There&apos;s a lot left to tackle before we&apos;re done.</string>
  <string id="98781" soundid="152566">Understood. You&apos;re more than able to make your own decisions.</string>
  <string id="98782" soundid="152567">Just make sure you&apos;re doing this for the right reasons.</string>
  <string id="98783" soundid="152568">There is one thing that&apos;s been puzzling me. Is.... No, it&apos;s nothing. We have things we should do instead of wasting time talking.</string>
  <string id="98784" soundid="152569">This could be a delicate subject, so if... well, stop me if I say anything out of line.</string>
  <string id="98785" soundid="152570">It&apos;s just that the... well, Silk Fox is obviously attracted to you, but you don&apos;t seem all that interested.</string>
  <string id="98786" soundid="152571">And then there&apos;s Dawn Star, who&apos;s clearly.... She idolizes you, and yet there&apos;s nothing between you. Is there some... I don&apos;t know, some reason?</string>
  <string id="98787" soundid="152572">Thank you for the candid answer.</string>
  <string id="98788" soundid="152573">Me? You mean....</string>
  <string id="98789" soundid="152574">I... wondered. It wasn&apos;t just the princess or Dawn Star; you came and spoke to me often. Certainly about nothing this important, but....</string>
  <string id="98790" soundid="152575">I&apos;m not quite sure how I feel right now, but you&apos;ve certainly given me something to think about. I&apos;ve never met someone like you and... that&apos;s, maybe, a place to start.</string>
  <string id="98791" soundid="152576">I need to think about this privately for a little while. We&apos;ll talk later.</string>
  <string id="98792" soundid="152577">You enjoy this, don&apos;t you? You like to twist people to see what it will take to make them snap!</string>
  <string id="98793" soundid="152578">I didn&apos;t expect that from you... you&apos;re not normally one to....</string>
  <string id="98794" soundid="152579">I&apos;m... I&apos;m going to pretend this conversation simply didn&apos;t happen. To do anything else would force me to stalk away and never come back.</string>
  <string id="98795" soundid="152580">You&apos;re wise beyond your years, my friend. There are times when love can complicate things immensely.</string>
  <string id="98796" soundid="152581">I&apos;m sorry! I just wondered if.... Well, it&apos;s nothing.</string>
  <string id="98797" soundid="152582">Ha, fair enough! The last thing I need is to be equated with the mad inventor.</string>
  <string id="98798" soundid="152583">There&apos;s adventure to be had, and we should get back to it. We have to stay focused if we&apos;re going to get through this alive.</string>
  <string id="98799" soundid="152584">Frankly, I would like to see the end of this little escapade.</string>
  <string id="98800" soundid="152585">I believe we have an appointment with the Emperor, by invitation of his daughter, no less.</string>
  <string id="98801" soundid="152586">Unless you have other things to finish, I see no reason to keep him waiting. Emperors hate to be disappointed.</string>
  <string id="98802" soundid="152587">I don&apos;t know about you, but if a member of the Imperial family were leaving me gifts, I&apos;d be mighty curious to learn more.</string>
  <string id="98803" soundid="152588">Then again, the Scholars&apos; Garden is full of more hot air than some flyers, so I can understand your reluctance to rush there.</string>
  <string id="98804" soundid="152589">You managed to satisfy the Lotus Assassins, and that&apos;s a major step forward. I just worry that it&apos;s a step over the edge of a precipice.</string>
  <string id="98805" soundid="152590">Despite my misgivings, I can&apos;t help but smile at the thought that you&apos;re the reason they&apos;re so keen to acquire new recruits. Nothing like thinning the ranks to make some room.</string>
  <string id="98806" soundid="152591">I never expected to see the inside of this place, and, frankly, I wish I hadn&apos;t.</string>
  <string id="98807" soundid="152592">I will give the Assassins this, though: They sure know how to decorate to a theme.</string>
  <string id="98808" soundid="152593">Well, let&apos;s see if I can break it down for you. We&apos;re desperately trying to impress the people who are trying to kill you and who kidnapped your master.</string>
  <string id="98809" soundid="152594">That, of course, will allow us to enter the heart of their lair where we can acquire highly sensitive evidence against the most dangerous man in the Empire. </string>
  <string id="98810" soundid="152595">If we were anyone else, I&apos;d say we were doomed, but hey, we got me.</string>
  <string id="98811" soundid="152596">I&apos;ll be honest, I can&apos;t think of anything I haven&apos;t said already.</string>
  <string id="98812" soundid="152597">Of course. I&apos;ll be here if you need anything.</string>
  <string id="98813" soundid="152598">I have no illusions that you might not cast me aside. For all my skills, all my charms, I&apos;m nothing compared to what you are and what you might become.</string>
  <string id="98814" soundid="152599">It&apos;s a risk I&apos;m willing to take.</string>
  <string id="98815" soundid="152600">I appreciate the sentiment, but we both know that you are the superior in this relationship. I will find a way to prove my worth to you, whatever it takes.</string>
  <string id="98816" soundid="152601">Ha! I would have deluded myself into thinking you would be fair about things and let me stand beside you &quot;just because.&quot;</string>
  <string id="98817" soundid="152602">Now I know you&apos;d be a fool to do that, which is why I will do all I can to prove my worth at your side.</string>
  <string id="98818" soundid="152603">I hope to do so at least once more. Your Master must be cast aside so that you can finish this. The Empire will be yours.</string>
  <string id="98819" soundid="152604">Then let us pass it with flying colors. Your Master will regret the basics he drilled so carefully into you. We&apos;ll make sure of it.</string>
  <string id="98820" soundid="152605">You know there will be. We will wrest time from heaven itself if we have to.</string>
  <string id="98821" soundid="152606">This journey began with loss for everyone. I think it&apos;s time to put that to a stop.</string>
  <string id="98822" soundid="152607">You know it. Let&apos;s finish this.</string>
  <string id="98824">What did you want to talk about before we left for the palace?</string>
  <string id="98825">Zu was a good man. I hope he has finally found some peace.</string>
  <string id="98827">What are you getting at?</string>
  <string id="98828">Zu died because he was a fool. Death&apos;s Hand was in my grasp.</string>
  <string id="98830">I think you need to bend a little, Yarou. Being a horse&apos;s ass won&apos;t help matters any.</string>
  <string id="98831">You&apos;ve learned some new tricks of your own, haven&apos;t you?</string>
  <string id="98834">Master Li was holding me back. I&apos;m sure of it.</string>
  <string id="98837">Stay with me, and you&apos;ll see that I am capable of much more.</string>
  <string id="98841">Is this so vital that we need to talk about it before the palace?</string>
  <string id="98845">I have some ideas of what&apos;s ahead.</string>
  <string id="98846">I prefer to deal with the future as it comes.</string>
  <string id="98847">You first. What do you think will happen?</string>
  <string id="98848">I have some idea.</string>
  <string id="98849">I want to help him replace his brother as Emperor.</string>
  <string id="98853">Despite Dawn Star&apos;s hopes, I think we will be too late to save him.</string>
  <string id="98856">If I know Master Li, he will want to rebuild his peaceful life in Two Rivers.</string>
  <string id="98859">I honestly have no idea.</string>
  <string id="98863">I think I could find some peace in my own school.</string>
  <string id="98867">I would like to learn more of my people, the Spirit Monks.</string>
  <string id="98871">I won&apos;t rest until I have destroyed everyone responsible for what&apos;s happened.</string>
  <string id="98874">I think I will take some time for myself. Perhaps with some roguish company.</string>
  <string id="98877">Maybe I&apos;ll settle down with some dashing rogue.</string>
  <string id="98880">I won&apos;t know until after this is finished.</string>
  <string id="98885">I am going to insist.</string>
  <string id="98886">My plans are my own. Mind your business.</string>
  <string id="98887">Let&apos;s hear them.</string>
  <string id="98896">We&apos;re smart. We&apos;ll figure it out, don&apos;t you think?</string>
  <string id="98901">I agree. This isn&apos;t the time.</string>
  <string id="98902">What if I want a little distracting?</string>
  <string id="98904">There is no us, Sky.</string>
  <string id="98905">We&apos;re friends. That&apos;s what&apos;s important.</string>
  <string id="98907">If you thought there was something between us, you were a fool.</string>
  <string id="98909" soundid="153741">Congratulations on winning everything and all, but I&apos;ll be glad if you never fight again. At least not in here. You just can&apos;t imagine!</string>
  <string id="98910">Go bother one of the others if you want to play at soothsayer.</string>
  <string id="98911">What&apos;s on your mind right now?</string>
  <string id="98913">There&apos;s no shame in dwelling on the past.</string>
  <string id="98915">It&apos;s about time. There are more pressing things ahead than Gao.</string>
  <string id="98917">The thought of all these nobles and their fat purses is making you giddy.</string>
  <string id="98919">If you have nothing more useful than that to say, keep your thoughts to yourself.</string>
  <string id="98921">Maybe a distraction is what I need. You&apos;re glad to be along?</string>
  <string id="98923">You realize you may not have a future if you follow me?</string>
  <string id="98925">Is there something specific you&apos;re looking forward to?</string>
  <string id="98927">You foresee a rich future of traveling the land and wooing fainting noblewomen, don&apos;t you?</string>
  <string id="98929">If you&apos;re done unburdening yourself, we have more important things to do.</string>
  <string id="98930">I shouldn&apos;t snap at you. We all have a history to share.</string>
  <string id="98933">I don&apos;t know, I wouldn&apos;t mind a bit of flattery here and there.</string>
  <string id="98935">If you can&apos;t handle me, maybe you should stick to waitresses and noblewomen.</string>
  <string id="98937">That&apos;s nice of you to say.</string>
  <string id="98939">Sounds like you&apos;re trying a new tactic to &quot;deal with me.&quot;</string>
  <string id="98943">As I recall, you leapt at the chance to join me, Sky.</string>
  <string id="98945">Don&apos;t discount yourself or the others.</string>
  <string id="98946">You can&apos;t be perfect unless you&apos;re humble about it, too, you know.</string>
  <string id="98947">I just take the time to appreciate those who are with me.</string>
  <string id="98949">Oh yes, years of intense mediation are required before you can say something nice.</string>
  <string id="98951">It&apos;s not humility. You wouldn&apos;t be with me if you weren&apos;t useful.</string>
  <string id="98954">No one else could do what I can. I&apos;m &quot;special.&quot;</string>
  <string id="98955">It&apos;s something I have to deal with. I shouldn&apos;t take it out on you.</string>
  <string id="98958">Sometimes I just want to be me, not a destiny.</string>
  <string id="98960">My abilities are unique. Only a fool would flinch from such power.</string>
  <string id="98962">It&apos;s something I wish nosy people wouldn&apos;t keep prying into.</string>
  <string id="98964">Good. You&apos;re with me for your skills. I have no interest in your musings.</string>
  <string id="98966">That&apos;s good advice. We&apos;re too busy for idle chit-chat.</string>
  <string id="98969">You were the one facing down three pirates alone not too long ago.</string>
  <string id="98971">I&apos;d prefer a life of peace, if it were possible.</string>
  <string id="98973">I don&apos;t find trouble, I cause it.</string>
  <string id="98975">Do you use that line on all the girls, Sky?</string>
  <string id="98980">People are suffering. I am going to find out why and fix it.</string>
  <string id="98982">It is a matter of honor. My home must be avenged.</string>
  <string id="98984">The Empire destroyed those who would have taught me to fully use my abilities.</string>
  <string id="98987">You&apos;re worried about me? That&apos;s sweet of you.</string>
  <string id="98988">What kind of excitement are we talking about?</string>
  <string id="98989">I can look after myself. I&apos;ve dealt with Assassins before.</string>
  <string id="98991">Why the concern?</string>
  <string id="98992">I&apos;ll tear that place down by its foundations if I have to.</string>
  <string id="98995">They&apos;ll have to kill me before they change me.</string>
  <string id="98998">Different how?</string>
  <string id="99000">I&apos;m stronger than the thieves you used to run with, Sky.</string>
  <string id="99002">You have to respect that kind of control over novices.</string>
  <string id="99006">Keep your worries to yourself. We have more important things to do.</string>
  <string id="99007">Never question my motivations. They&apos;re mine alone.</string>
  <string id="99009">What&apos;s on your mind?</string>
  <string id="99010">If you have something to say, say it.</string>
  <string id="99013">Neither one of them is interesting to me. That&apos;s all there is to it.</string>
  <string id="99015">There&apos;s a very good reason. You.</string>
  <string id="99017">If this makes you uncomfortable, we can pretend this conversation never happened.</string>
  <string id="99018">How do you feel about things?</string>
  <string id="99020">You believed me? Sky, you&apos;re a fool; I don&apos;t have feelings for anyone in this group.</string>
  <string id="99023">Relationships are a weakness my enemies would be quick to exploit.</string>
  <string id="99024">What we&apos;re trying to do is too important. Personal matters can wait.</string>
  <string id="99026">Stay out of my affairs, Sky. You have no right to ask me this.</string>
  <string id="99028">You&apos;re absolutely right. Let&apos;s get back to it.</string>
  <string id="99029">I&apos;ve already got Kang, Sky. I don&apos;t need two people stammering around me.</string>
  <string id="99032">What are your thoughts on our situation?</string>
  <string id="99039">I&apos;ll talk to you later, Sky.</string>
  <string id="99042">You stayed true to me through everything. I won&apos;t forget that.</string>
  <string id="99043">Would you have said that before you met me?</string>
  <string id="99045">You have proven your worth a dozen times over.</string>
  <string id="99046">One final test, Sky. Master Li is the final test for both of us.</string>
  <string id="99048">Lotus Assassin</string>
  <string id="99051">Lotus Assassin</string>
  <string id="99054">Lotus Assassin</string>
  <string id="99057">Dawn Star</string>
  <string id="99088" soundid="152873">Hold on, there. This way leads into the Necropolis, a dangerous area. You shouldn&apos;t go in there unless you have some business there.</string>
  <string id="99089" soundid="152874">[Success] Y... yes, but I must warn you: the dead aren&apos;t the only terrifying things in the Necropolis. They say the Lotus Assassins have a special interest in the place.</string>
  <string id="99090" soundid="152875">The Empire? What is there to know? The world bows before us. Everyone is in awe of our culture. We are the finest and purest examples of the human race.</string>
  <string id="99091" soundid="152876">Led by the most glorious Emperor, we are truly the people closest to heaven.</string>
  <string id="99092" soundid="152877">The... the Lotus Assassins. They are the personal guard of the Emperor and serve directly under Death&apos;s Hand. They are above our laws and act with impunity.</string>
  <string id="99093" soundid="152878">We are forced to obey, or... they kill. Even us, even soldiers. But the Emperor either turns a blind eye or is so far under the sway of Death&apos;s Hand, that....</string>
  <string id="99094" soundid="152879">I&apos;ve said too much. The less said about them, the better. They listen from the shadows. It is not wise to speak about them.</string>
  <string id="99095" soundid="152880">Stay away from the Necropolis. It&apos;s dangerous.</string>
  <string id="99096" soundid="152881">Stay away from the Necropolis. I wouldn&apos;t want a pretty girl like you getting hurt in there.</string>
  <string id="99097" soundid="152882">[Failure] So? I&apos;m not here to stop you. I&apos;m just here to warn you. Any fool can go in and risk their life with the walking dead.</string>
  <string id="99098" soundid="169879">I haven&apos;t had time to think about anything except Master Li and Two Rivers and the Imperial City... it&apos;s all so much to take in.</string>
  <string id="99099" soundid="152884">Well, I&apos;m not here to stop anybody. I just warn them. It&apos;s been a lot more dangerous in there recently. They say ghosts of the dead walk again!</string>
  <string id="99100" soundid="152885">They couldn&apos;t pay me enough to go in there and put them down. The dead are best left alone!</string>
  <string id="99101" soundid="152886">Ghosts have been rising up everywhere in the Empire, I&apos;ve heard. So many have come up in the Necropolis that it just isn&apos;t safe anymore.</string>
  <string id="99102" soundid="152887">It would take an army of us to clear them out... if we could do it at all. We can&apos;t even safely post a guard in there.</string>
  <string id="99103" soundid="152888">We just warn people away. The Lotus Assassins want everyone kept away, as well. First time I&apos;ve heard of them being altruistic.</string>
  <string id="99104" soundid="152889">Things have been bad over the past few--let&apos;s say five--years. No one has any idea why so many of the dead refuse to return to the wheel of life peacefully.</string>
  <string id="99105" soundid="152890">All we know for sure is that they&apos;re not happy. Not happy at all.</string>
  <string id="99106" soundid="152891">Bad. Real bad. Monks used to go in every few weeks to clean out the ones who had risen, but lately it has become too much for them to handle.</string>
  <string id="99107" soundid="169880">I was thinking about the Imperial City. It is such an expansive place, with a great deal of history. But my... my gift lets me see other things as well. Glimmers of the past.</string>
  <string id="99108" soundid="152893">Leave the dead to their own is what I say. Just block the whole place off and start again somewhere else.</string>
  <string id="99109" soundid="152894">Anything else you need? Talk helps pass the time on duty.</string>
  <string id="99110" soundid="152895">If you&apos;re still going in there, just watch your back.</string>
  <string id="99111" soundid="152896">I... I&apos;d hate to see a pretty lady like you get hurt. If you&apos;re going in there... just watch your back.</string>
  <string id="99112" soundid="152897">What can I do for you, citizen?</string>
  <string id="99113" soundid="152898">It&apos;s the city of the dead, as some call it. The burial tombs of hundreds of generations of our most honored ancestors. To be buried in the necropolis is a great honor.</string>

  <string id="99249" soundid="153072">I don&apos;t want to talk about it at length right now. You have more pressing things to deal with, but after... after you&apos;re done, we should talk.</string>
  <string id="99250" soundid="153073">If anyone can deal with their kind, it&apos;s you, but that doesn&apos;t mean I could let you go in there without speaking up.</string>

  <string id="99256" soundid="153079">Who&apos;s to say Zu isn&apos;t preparing a trap for you to earn back favor with his old brethren?</string>

  <string id="99267">I appreciate the advice.</string>
  <string id="99269">I&apos;ll be safe, but I&apos;m not rushing. You never know what else we might learn in there.</string>
  <string id="99271">You sound like you&apos;re worried.</string>
  <string id="99274">I&apos;ve come to trust Zu. He won&apos;t betray me.</string>
  <string id="99276">I&apos;m aware of the possibility, but I will deal with it if needed.</string>

  <string id="99294" soundid="153119">You will need more than my help. Just try not to endanger your companions. They are not to blame for what your destiny mandates. Now, is there anything else?</string>
  <string id="99295" soundid="153120">I am always &quot;agitated.&quot; It is because of my training. We were taught that we are always being watched, always being stalked. In many cases, it is actually true.</string>
  <string id="99296" soundid="153121">You likely have similar feelings. When trained to be as vicious as the Assassins--or when you are the protégé of a famous master--you tend to attract unwelcome interest.</string>
  <string id="99297" soundid="153122">I wonder how you will react to this scrutiny. I also wonder if your fellows will stand by you when the true weight of what you claim becomes known.</string>
  <string id="99298" soundid="153123">Once again I cast doubt upon myself. It seems I am destined to garner suspicion, even if my actions remain neutral. </string>
  <string id="99299" soundid="153124">The sides of the coming conflict seem very well defined. That will not always be the case. It is sometimes difficult to see the truth behind the actions of others.</string>
  <string id="99300" soundid="153125">Enough. I don&apos;t have anything else relevant to say. Perhaps I will when I have seen more of what you are capable of... and what your master intends.</string>
  <string id="99301" soundid="153126">Your best may not be enough. That is why it is so often used as comfort after failure. &quot;You tried your best, but death consumed the nation anyway. Sorry.&quot;</string>
  <string id="99302" soundid="153127">If your master is right, the actions of the average citizen of the Empire will not matter in the least. Many will prefer ignorance over knowing they are helpless.</string>
  <string id="99303" soundid="153128">That is... an old wound. My departure from the Lotus Assassins was not gentle for either side. My immediate companions, those who were my brothers, fell by my hand.</string>
  <string id="99304" soundid="153129">Lim was not among them. He would have died if he was. I was labeled as the one who deserted, and I am occasionally recognized. The result is always the same.</string>
  <string id="99305" soundid="153130">Another death, more blood spilled. Such a waste for a hatred they cannot even understand.</string>
  <string id="99306" soundid="153131">For now, we should make our way to the Imperial City. That is where they took your master and where we will find the heart of the Lotus Assassins.</string>
  <string id="99307" soundid="153132">For now, you should continue your search for a means to reach the Palace. Your Master will be waiting.</string>
  <string id="99308" soundid="153133">I will answer if it suits me.</string>
  <string id="99309" soundid="153134">Regret? I have no regret for killing anyone who challenged me of their own will. Death is a measurable cost of your actions. Some earn it sooner than others.</string>
  <string id="99310" soundid="153135">Strength is the way of things, and death is the end... or should be. Some do not respect either. They have enough of one to defy the other.</string>
  <string id="99311" soundid="153136">Does it matter? Denying someone&apos;s strength is to place yourself above that person without merit. Denying death is to step outside the natural order. Both are harmful.</string>
  <string id="99312" soundid="153137">No matter your motives, helping the Assassins harms you. If you corrupt the spirit shard, you can move forward while *also* crippling their golems.</string>
  <string id="99315">Only you and Dawn Star are with me. I do not question her loyalty.</string>
  <string id="99318">If anyone is drawn to my cause, I will do my best not to endanger them.</string>
  <string id="99320">You question why I should be trusted? What about you?</string>
  <string id="99321">If Master Li was right, people should help me to help themselves.</string>
  <string id="99325">Death&apos;s Hand will fall like any other. You will see.</string>
  <string id="99326">I want to go back to my other questions.</string>
  <string id="99327">It must be difficult to regret the deaths of so many.</string>
  <string id="99329">Enough of which? Strength or death?</string>
  <string id="99330">That&apos;s horrible. You feel no guilt for killing people?</string>
  <string id="99331">Why did you leave the Assassins? Why do you hate them so much?</string>
  <string id="99332">Bah! Never regret killing someone who would have killed you.</string>
  <string id="99334">What are your feelings on the Imperial City? How powerful are the Lotus Assassins here?</string>
  <string id="99335">How do you feel about the plan to join the Lotus Assassins? I will need your knowledge.</string>
  <string id="99336" soundid="154303">I&apos;m glad we helped them. I feel good, for a change.</string>
  <string id="99356" soundid="153201">[Success] Look, you don&apos;t have to get that way. These guys are ruthless... I&apos;m just looking out for myself. I hope they decide to kill you instead of me.</string>
  <string id="99357" soundid="153202">C&apos;mon... I&apos;ll take you there now, but I can&apos;t promise you&apos;ll get a warm reception.</string>

  <string id="99745" soundid="153598">Let me be. An honest merchant used to make a good living in this town, but those drunken sailors have stolen most of my goods! I have nothing to sell you.</string>
  <string id="99746" soundid="153599">Most of what is missing is perishable items: grain, baked goods, fruit. There&apos;s little chance of getting them back, and they&apos;re hardly worth the effort.</string>
  <string id="99750" soundid="153603">Normally I would look to the local officials to help, but as you&apos;ve already seen, Minister Sheng can do little about these sailors. Nobody in town can help.</string>

  <string id="99752" soundid="158581">You said you felt the lightning coming, but not even Master Li knows the weather like that. I trust your instincts. You are full of such promise.</string>
  <string id="99753" soundid="153606">Thank you. Tong and his friends are usually off getting drunk near the store houses, past Beggar&apos;s Pier in the southeast corner of town. </string>
  <string id="99754" soundid="153607">Please, I&apos;m not looking for vengeance. I just want my mother&apos;s figurine back.</string>

  <string id="99756" soundid="153609">That is all I can ask. Thank you.</string>
  <string id="99757" soundid="153610">I apologize for the inconvenience, but I have nothing to offer. If the sailors were gone, it might be different.</string>
  <string id="99758" soundid="153611">Thank goodness the Great Dam is closed! Whatever other trials we may face, at least we are in contact with the outside world. Those sailors were causing real trouble here!</string>
  <string id="99759" soundid="158582">Oh, don&apos;t be such a sour fish. I wonder about it all the time. You are filled with such promise. My abilities seem so much darker.</string>
  <string id="99760" soundid="158583">We should go to Gujin for a weapon, like Master Li said. Then we can address whatever threat these bandits pose.</string>
  <string id="99761" soundid="153614">We&apos;ve started to get new shipments into town. The selection is not yet as great as I would like, but it is getting there.  Would you like to see what I have to sell?</string>
  <string id="99762" soundid="153615"></string>
  <string id="99763" soundid="153616">Greetings, honored traveller. I regret to tell you that I still have nothing to offer. The sailors take whatever I try to sell and give me nothing in return.</string>
  <string id="99764" soundid="153617">Greetings once again. As I said before, I have no wares to sell you. Between the town being cut off and sailors like Tong stealing from me, I have nothing left.</string>
  <string id="99765" soundid="158584">We should make our way to Gujin as soon as we can.</string>
  <string id="99766" soundid="158585">There is no time to talk. We have to save the village from these bandits!</string>
  <string id="99767" soundid="158586"></string>
  <string id="99768" soundid="158587">This is so confusing. Master Li said I could explain the nature of spirits, but... these were different. That sorcerer forced them to appear, like wild dogs let loose.</string>
  <string id="99770" soundid="158589">I was worried enough when we were expecting bandits, now it seems there are dangers we don&apos;t even know about. Master Li called that... that sorcerer an *assassin.*</string>
  <string id="99771" soundid="158590">Assassins don&apos;t attack at random. They have very specific prey. I don&apos;t... I don&apos;t want anything to happen to this home. I&apos;ve never belonged anywhere else.</string>

  <string id="99773" soundid="158592">Would it be strange of me to say I don&apos;t know? I have very little memory of my home before coming here, even though I was three years old when I arrived.</string>
  <string id="99774" soundid="158593">I remember moving around a lot... never staying anywhere for long... and for some reason, the robes of that sorcerer looked familiar to me. I don&apos;t know why.</string>
  <string id="99775" soundid="158594">I&apos;m sure it&apos;s nothing. Just the memories of childhood playing tricks. With glimpses of the spirit realm invading my thoughts, I could have seen them anywhere.</string>
  <string id="99776" soundid="158595">I can&apos;t remember specific incidents, but I am used to being shunned. People are not very welcoming of those who appear to not let the dead lay peacefully.</string>
  <string id="99777" soundid="158596">Master Li said I was brought to him by a concerned ally who received me from yet another person. That person wanted me safe, but he said he couldn&apos;t ensure it himself.</string>
  <string id="99778" soundid="153631">Of course, honorable one. What is it you wish to know?</string>
  <string id="99779" soundid="158597">Master Li doesn&apos;t know who that guardian was, or what I needed protection from. He promised to look into it, but he has not had time. Your training has taken precedence.</string>
  <string id="99780" soundid="153633">Welcome back, honorable one. I haven&apos;t forgotten my promise. I&apos;ll give you a discount on all my goods as soon as my shop opens again.</string>

  <string id="99784" soundid="158599">Yes, I suppose you know something about that, as well. I hope this does not sound odd, but I am glad we share that.</string>
  <string id="99785" soundid="153638">The Great Dam? It is located beyond the haunted ruins of the old town. It would be... inadvisable to go there. As I said, it is haunted.</string>
  <string id="99786" soundid="153639">Rumors say that the ghosts of those who died when the dam was closed have risen, and seek vengeance. It is hearsay, of course, but still... I would never go there.</string>
  <string id="99787" soundid="153640">I am sorry to say that I do not know. But surely a dam that can be opened can be closed. The engineers and architects must have made some sort of mechanism.</string>
  <string id="99788" soundid="153641">But I am just a humble merchant. You should speak to Minister Sheng from the Ministry of Harmony. He would surely know more about this than I do.</string>
  <string id="99789" soundid="158600">Thanks for this talk. The events on the beach worried me, but you always improve my mood. Let&apos;s get back to what you need to do.</string>
  <string id="99790" soundid="153643">Of course. This humble merchant thanks you for your time.</string>
  <string id="99791" soundid="153644">Welcome back, honorable one. Since the dam was closed, I&apos;ve been able to restock my supplies. Would you like to see what I have for sale?</string>
  <string id="99793" soundid="158601">Like revealing the names of killers or locations of lost family treasures? I wish it *was* so easy to measure. The spirits I see tend to wander without purpose.</string>
  <string id="99794" soundid="158602">It&apos;s like a reflection of my own life. I was brought to Master Li by an ally of his who received me from yet another person, a guardian who said he couldn&apos;t ensure my safety.</string>
  <string id="99796" soundid="158603">Names or titles are often given based on significant events or particular skills. I was apparently named for a red glow opposite the morning sun on the day of my birth.</string>
  <string id="99797">I&apos;ll go talk to Tong for you.</string>
  <string id="99799">Tong will pay for what he&apos;s done!</string>
  <string id="99801">If I run into him, I&apos;ll see.</string>
  <string id="99803">Is there some kind of reward if I help you?</string>
  <string id="99804">Then you&apos;re useless to me.</string>
  <string id="99807" soundid="158604">I have no other information than that. I remember moving around a lot... and for some reason, the robes of that sorcerer looked familiar to me. I don&apos;t know why.</string>
  <string id="99808" soundid="158605">I see. Very well, I will try not to trouble you with this. What else do you want?</string>
  <string id="99809">Show me what you have for sale.</string>
  <string id="99812">Not right now.</string>
  <string id="99814" soundid="158606">I worry there won&apos;t be time, but all right.</string>
  <string id="99815">x</string>
  <string id="99816">x</string>
  <string id="99817">x</string>
  <string id="99823">x</string>
  <string id="99824">x</string>
  <string id="99825">x</string>
  <string id="99826" soundid="158618">Yes? I&apos;ll help if I can, but Master Li is waiting for you.</string>
  <string id="99827" soundid="158619">Well, we&apos;ve already visited Gujin, who used to be a guard in the west, they say. Old Ming always has a story, and he&apos;s usually by the statue on the beach.</string>
  <string id="99828" soundid="158620">Merchant Fen Do is in the village square. He&apos;s been expecting new goods &quot;any day now&quot; for weeks.</string>
  <string id="99829" soundid="158621">Oh! For training or learning the philosophy behind martial combat, go see Smiling Mountain. He is behind the ring, near the student quarters. He is always amusing.</string>
  <string id="99830" soundid="158622"></string>
  <string id="99831" soundid="158623">That was exciting. I&apos;m glad you are safe. I knew you would be. Your skill is unmatched. Even Gao had to see that. I suppose that&apos;s what set him off.</string>
  <string id="99832" soundid="158624">I hope he isn&apos;t allowed to stay. Punishment just makes him worse. Master Li has bent like a willow to accommodate him and his sorcerous father.</string>
  <string id="99833" soundid="158625">But don&apos;t you wish that some things made more sense? Anticipation is grueling... so much could be happening that you just don&apos;t know about.</string>
  <string id="99834">I want to ask you some questions.</string>
  <string id="99835" soundid="158626">Yes! Yes, he does! I didn&apos;t want to say but... well, I guess that&apos;s why we aren&apos;t the master and he is. He must be thinking of bigger things.</string>
  <string id="99836" soundid="158627">It scares me sometimes, all this talk of troubled spirits. I didn&apos;t ask to be a part of it. As much as you want to know more, I doubt you had a say in your fate, either.</string>
  <string id="99837">Tell me about Sheng and the Ministry of Harmony.</string>
  <string id="99839" soundid="158628">I&apos;m... I&apos;m sorry, this is supposed to be a happy time. You&apos;ve proven your ability and... Master Li is waiting for you. You should go to him.</string>
  <string id="99840" soundid="158629">You can&apos;t mean that. I mean, Master Li does do some odd things, but he must be thinking of bigger issues.</string>
  <string id="99841">Where is the Great Dam?</string>
  <string id="99843" soundid="158630">You should speak with Master Li. He will want you to enter the spirit cave soon.</string>
  <string id="99844">How could the Great Dam be closed?</string>
  <string id="99846" soundid="158631">Master Li would want us to stay focused.</string>
  <string id="99848">I&apos;ll be going now.</string>
  <string id="99850" soundid="158633"></string>
  <string id="99851" soundid="158634">What happened to Gao&apos;s men? I thought they abandoned him, but it looks like you had to fight them all!</string>
  <string id="99852" soundid="158635">I didn&apos;t realize you took that much of a risk getting to me. Thank you.</string>
  <string id="99853" soundid="158636">I heard Gao yelling at them to kill any bandits who might approach. I guess they wouldn&apos;t stop to ask questions.</string>
  <string id="99854" soundid="158637">His mercenaries didn&apos;t seem too eager to follow me into the cave, though. It seemed like they were humoring him.</string>
  <string id="99855" soundid="158638">Maybe they were his father&apos;s men? I don&apos;t... wait... do you hear something?</string>
  <string id="99856" soundid="158639"></string>
  <string id="99857" soundid="158640">There are so many. Where are they coming from?</string>
  <string id="99858" soundid="158641">You should be more concerned with where they are going.</string>
  <string id="99859" soundid="158642"></string>
  <string id="99860" soundid="158643">You may have won a victory over Gao the Lesser, but it looks like he put things in motion that have outlived him.</string>
  <string id="99861" soundid="158644">What? What do you mean?</string>
  <string id="99862" soundid="158645">These machines have weapons. They drop casks that explode on impact. There will be soldiers on the ground, as well.</string>
  <string id="99863" soundid="158646">Was... was that what Gao meant? He said something about death coming from above for Master Li!</string>
  <string id="99865" soundid="158647">It doesn&apos;t matter! We have to get back! The students... everyone will need our help!</string>
  <string id="99866" soundid="158648">Walk away, Dawn Star. You won&apos;t get there in time. Better to avert your eyes than see something you care about fall to ruin. Save yourself the pain.</string>
  <string id="99867" soundid="158649">This... machine of Gao&apos;s... do you know how to make it work? Could you fly it?</string>
  <string id="99868" soundid="153742">You&apos;re one of the fighters now, aren&apos;t you?</string>
  <string id="99869" soundid="153743">Raging Dragon, right?</string>
  <string id="99870" soundid="153744">Silver Phoenix, was it?</string>
  <string id="99871" soundid="153745">You&apos;re that Tiger Lifts the Mountain, right?</string>
  <string id="99872" soundid="153746">Well, there&apos;s nothing for you to do here. I take bets, and you don&apos;t get to bet when you&apos;re a fighter, so push off.</string>
  <string id="99873" soundid="153747">You? What could you possibly want? You&apos;re not here to bet are you?</string>
  <string id="99874" soundid="153748">Betting&apos;s only open when there&apos;s a match on, and right now, I don&apos;t see hundreds of people screaming at me, so I can assume there&apos;s no match on.</string>
  <string id="99875" soundid="153749">When Qui the Promoter gets around to setting one up. Go bother him if you really have to know this instant.</string>
  <string id="99876" soundid="153750">Of course, he&apos;ll take one look at you and say, &quot;there&apos;s a new fish to throw into the ring!&quot; Good money if you fight for him, but that&apos;s your business and no care of mine.</string>
  <string id="99877" soundid="153751">If you want to find Qui, he&apos;ll be upstairs, usually in the fighter&apos;s room just past where the nobles marinate in their own decadence.</string>
  <string id="99878" soundid="153752">Right now, it doesn&apos;t. No match, no bets. That&apos;s not so hard, is it?</string>
  <string id="99879" soundid="153753">And don&apos;t ask how it works when a match is on, I&apos;m not your teacher. Come to think of it, you look a bit strapping. Why not fight instead of talking to me?</string>
  <string id="99880" soundid="153754">Qui the Promoter&apos;s your man if you&apos;re interested. He&apos;ll be upstairs a few rooms around the circle.</string>
  <string id="99881" soundid="153755">Good, you do that. I need all the quiet I can get before the matches start. Have to build it up so I don&apos;t go insane when the crowds come.</string>
  <string id="99888">When will there be a match to bet on?</string>
  <string id="99891">How does betting work?</string>
  <string id="99894">I&apos;ll let you get back to... er, standing here.</string>
  <string id="99895">Arena Guard</string>
  <string id="99898">Guild Arena Observer</string>
  <string id="99901">Happy Endings the Courtesan</string>
  <string id="99904" soundid="153778">Let us just say that cooler heads prevail. The current sentiment in the Guild is that the Lotus Assassins have become more trouble than our alliance with them is worth.</string>
  <string id="99907" soundid="153783">There&apos;s some people who call the way I operate &quot;walking the Low Path,&quot; but they&apos;re fools.</string>
  <string id="99908" soundid="153784">Talking about the low path is an attempt to deride the philosophy of those of us who see the truth.</string>
  <string id="99909" soundid="153785">There&apos;s no real altruists in this world. Just people who explain their actions with reasons that are easily palatable to the masses.</string>
  <string id="99910" soundid="153786">I refuse to kowtow to those kind of lies. I&apos;m a warrior; people either challenge me and grow stronger or run away like weaklings.</string>
  <string id="99911" soundid="153787">Like I care. It&apos;s in my nature to rail against simpering fools, and by being true to the discord I cause, I&apos;m made that much stronger.</string>
  <string id="99912" soundid="153788">That&apos;s all there is to it. I&apos;m not here to hash this over with you. If you want that, go bother the scholars or one of those saps in the Black Leopard school on the hill.</string>
  <string id="99915">Tell me more about the Low Path.</string>
  <string id="99918">That philosophy can&apos;t earn you many friends.</string>
  <string id="99952" soundid="153828">I&apos;m ready!</string>
  <string id="99953" soundid="153829">Time to bloody my axes!</string>
  <string id="99954" soundid="153830">I&apos;m looking forward to killing something... anything.</string>
  <string id="99955" soundid="153831">Let&apos;s see if we can find ourselves a fight!</string>
  <string id="99956" soundid="153832">My axes are yours!</string>
  <string id="99957" soundid="153833">The fun starts now!</string>
  <string id="99958" soundid="153834">Time to smash some skulls!</string>
  <string id="99959" soundid="153835">Ha, ha! No one will dare stop us!</string>
  <string id="99960" soundid="153836">As you command.</string>
  <string id="99961" soundid="153837">I am here.</string>
  <string id="99962" soundid="153838">I am yours to command.</string>
  <string id="99963" soundid="153839">I am ready.</string>
  <string id="99964" soundid="153840">My strength belongs to you.</string>
  <string id="99965" soundid="153841">You will is my command.</string>
  <string id="99966" soundid="153842">I go where you wish.</string>
  <string id="99967" soundid="153843">I hear and obey.</string>
  <string id="99968" soundid="153844">I will not let you down.</string>
  <string id="99969" soundid="153845">I&apos;m honored that you have chosen me.</string>
  <string id="99970" soundid="153846">Together, we cannot fail.</string>
  <string id="99971" soundid="153847">It is an honor to fight at your side.</string>
  <string id="99972" soundid="153848">We were trained together, your selection is only right.</string>
  <string id="99973" soundid="153849">Thank you for asking me to accompany you.</string>
  <string id="99974" soundid="153850">I will give everything I have to aid you.</string>
  <string id="99975" soundid="153851">I look forward to our journey together.</string>
  <string id="99976" soundid="153852">I&apos;ve got the wine. Let&apos;s go.</string>
  <string id="99977" soundid="153853">I just hope we don&apos;t bump into my suspicious spouse.</string>
  <string id="99978" soundid="153854">This may be a bad time to tell you, but I&apos;m allergic to death... especially my own.</string>
  <string id="99979" soundid="153855">Let&apos;s go kneed some dough! What? It&apos;s the best I could come up with.</string>
  <string id="99980" soundid="153856">You&apos;re not taking me someplace dangerous, I hope.</string>
  <string id="99981" soundid="153857">I hope nobody touches my buns while I&apos;m gone.</string>
  <string id="99982" soundid="153858">I made the wine extra strong. You just have to ignore the chunky bits.</string>
  <string id="99983" soundid="153859">I&apos;m flattered you chose me... scared to death, but flattered.</string>
  <string id="99984" soundid="153860">No, no, no. I must stay at the camp to look after the Marvelous Dragonfly.</string>
  <string id="99985" soundid="153861">I will be more use to you here than traipsing about away from my tools.</string>
  <string id="99986" soundid="153862">No, I have too much work to do on the Marvelous Dragonfly.</string>
  <string id="99987" soundid="153863">If you want the Marvelous Dragonfly to work properly, leave me be!</string>
  <string id="99988" soundid="153864">This is more like it.</string>
  <string id="99989" soundid="153865">Anything is better than waiting around in the camp.</string>
  <string id="99990" soundid="153866">I am not accustomed to following orders, but I will try.</string>
  <string id="99991" soundid="153867">Good. I did not join you to sit idly by.</string>
  <string id="99992" soundid="153868">My weapons are at your disposal.</string>
  <string id="99993" soundid="153869">I think we will make an excellent duo.</string>
  <string id="99994" soundid="153870">I will assist you however I can.</string>
  <string id="99995" soundid="153871">Our enemies will curse the day they were born!</string>
  <string id="99996" soundid="153872">Time for a little adventure.</string>
  <string id="99997" soundid="153873">My blades are yours to command.</string>
  <string id="99998" soundid="153874">This will be fun, you and I together.</string>
  <string id="99999" soundid="153875">Name it, and it&apos;s done.</string>
  <string id="100000" soundid="153876">This promises to be interesting.</string>
  <string id="100001" soundid="153877">Ahh... finally a chance to stretch my legs.</string>
  <string id="100002" soundid="153878">Whatever you need, I&apos;ll be happy to help.</string>
  <string id="100003" soundid="153879">Our enemies will fall like leaves in autumn.</string>
  <string id="100004" soundid="153880">I thought you&apos;d never ask.</string>
  <string id="100005" soundid="153881">It&apos;s about time.</string>
  <string id="100006" soundid="153882">A wise choice.</string>
  <string id="100007" soundid="153883">I foresee much pain and agony ahead.</string>
  <string id="100008" soundid="153884">The world is ours for the taking.</string>
  <string id="100009" soundid="153885">Our enemies will tremble before us.</string>
  <string id="100010" soundid="153886">I thought you&apos;d never ask.</string>
  <string id="100011" soundid="153887">Now you&apos;ll see what a true demon can do.</string>
  <string id="100012" soundid="153888">Ah, excellent. I have many items... just waiting for you.</string>
  <string id="100013" soundid="153889">You know, I think I actually like this job better than my last.</string>
  <string id="100014" soundid="153890">I have acquired some great new items.</string>
  <string id="100015" soundid="153891">Dead or alive, it doesn&apos;t matter to me. What can get for you today?</string>
  <string id="100016" soundid="153892">I&apos;ve found some real gems lately. Just look and see.</string>
  <string id="100017" soundid="153893">Zin Bu is always happy to serve you.</string>
  <string id="100018" soundid="153894">I feel terrible for the poor soul who took over my last position.</string>
  <string id="100019" soundid="153895">Are you buying, selling... or both? I&apos;m here to help with all your trading needs.</string>
  <string id="100020" soundid="153896">Let&apos;s go.</string>
  <string id="100021" soundid="153897">Let&apos;s keep things simple. If someone gets in our way... remove them.</string>
  <string id="100022" soundid="153898">Ready to serve.</string>
  <string id="100023" soundid="153899">My staff and skills are yours to command.</string>
  <string id="100024" soundid="153900">I am ready and willing.</string>
  <string id="100025" soundid="153901">Good. I need a break from the others in the camp.</string>
  <string id="100026" soundid="153902">Don&apos;t worry, I&apos;ll be right behind you.</string>
  <string id="100027" soundid="153903">I&apos;ll stay out of your way if you&apos;ll stay out of mine.</string>
  <string id="100029">Patron</string>
  <string id="100031" soundid="153907">You also have to select a fuel. It looks like there are a few pieces of cinnabar in the contraption, but it may accept others, as well.</string>
  <string id="100032" soundid="153908">It looks like a powerful thing, so just guessing at the possible configurations will probably get you into trouble and waste the cinnabar in the machine.</string>
  <string id="100033" soundid="153909">I won&apos;t stop you, but you really should look for something that lists which configurations are good. Who knows what you will get with random settings.</string>
  <string id="100034" soundid="153910">I don&apos;t know. We&apos;ll just have to keep our eyes open as we travel. The Imperial City will likely hold something. It is large enough to accumulate anything.</string>
  <string id="100035" soundid="153911">If you try to pound a nail sideways, is it the hammer&apos;s fault? Don&apos;t blame your tools. Obviously, you didn&apos;t have the correct configuration... very risky.</string>
  <string id="100036" soundid="153912">You&apos;d better check your settings. You have a configuration that we found previously. Make sure it&apos;s set properly.</string>
  <string id="100037" soundid="153913">Best to find something listing a likely configuration, rather than just guessing. There must be something around here somewhere, although they could be anywhere.</string>
  <string id="100038" soundid="153914">Ha! Quite a stroke of luck... but I wouldn&apos;t try that too many times without a configuration if I were you. Who knows what this device will choke out.</string>

  <string id="100042" soundid="153918">Before you do all that, you should make sure you know what configuration you want. Otherwise... boom! You never know what might happen.</string>
  <string id="100043">Patron</string>
  <string id="100045" soundid="153921">All right, all right. Have a look around or whatever it is you do. Come and find me when you want to go back.</string>
  <string id="100047" soundid="153923">There&apos;s just something about this place. I can almost feel it, it&apos;s on the tip of my brain... and then it&apos;s gone. I just wish something would help prod my memory.</string>

  <string id="100082" soundid="171212">If you must.</string>
  <string id="100083" soundid="171213">You need to know something more?</string>
  <string id="100084">Is it magical?</string>
  <string id="100086">Couldn&apos;t you just buy one for yourself?</string>
  <string id="100089">Let&apos;s go back to my other questions.</string>
  <string id="100090" soundid="171220">Gullible fool. Six Heavens thought to build his legacy upon mine. Take his silver. Had he truly walked the Way of the Closed Fist, he would have seen his coming doom.</string>
  <string id="100091" soundid="171221">Have you finished speaking with those apparitions? Are you ready to tell me which of them most deserved death?</string>
  <string id="100092" soundid="171222">You are worthy to aid me in my cause, and so I will grant you a chance to carry out my wishes.</string>
  <string id="100096">Focus Mode ON</string>
  <string id="100097">Focus Mode OFF</string>
  <string id="100100" soundid="153990">These outlaws lack resolve. Look how easily they gave up their lives. Such a waste.</string>
  <string id="100101" soundid="153991">You have even recovered Minister Sheng&apos;s weapon. Is it as impressive as he claimed it to be?</string>
  <string id="100102" soundid="153992">I&apos;m sure the minister will reward you when he arrives. He is bringing reinforcements in his Marvelous Dragonfly.</string>
  <string id="100103" soundid="153993">I don&apos;t know why he thinks they are needed. These bandits pose no real threat.</string>
  <string id="100104" soundid="153994">Well, the minister may not share your dedication to the safety of the roads, but he will appreciate the outcome regardless.</string>
  <string id="100105" soundid="153995">He will arrive soon with reinforcements. I&apos;m not sure why. These bandits pose no real threat.</string>
  <string id="100106" soundid="153996">The minister may dispute your claim when he arrives. He is bringing reinforcements in his Marvelous Dragonfly.</string>
  <string id="100108">The quality is irrelevant. The theft was an insult.</string>
  <string id="100110">I only care about ending the threat these bandits pose.</string>
  <string id="100112">It will do. It is mine now, regardless.</string>
  <string id="100114" soundid="154004">Right now is a particularly dangerous time, as one of the leaders of the Guild has recently been... inhumed. Kai Lan sees this as an opportunity.</string>
  <string id="100116" soundid="154018">I fight, I bear the stains of bloodshed with pride as all Assassins are trained to do. But records must be kept, if only to know who to make examples of.</string>
  <string id="100117" soundid="154019">You will not find an Assassin who is shy about killing, acolyte. None of us are here to *learn* to be vicious.</string>
  <string id="100118" soundid="154020">Goodbye, acolyte. Serve our masters well.</string>
  <string id="100119" soundid="154021">Hello once more, acolyte. Have you any inquiries for the archive?</string>
  <string id="100120" soundid="154022">Hmm, Gang is dead too, isn&apos;t he? Well, I&apos;m sure the successor will be determined later. Would you care, acolyte, to contribute your name to this record?</string>
  <string id="100121" soundid="154023">Only to chronicle your alleged involvement, of course. </string>
  <string id="100122" soundid="154024">Of course, of course. I know how to appease those destined for greatness within the order. Have you any questions for the archive?</string>
  <string id="100123" soundid="154025">As you wish. Unlike many in our order, I am careful whom I anger. Have you any questions to make of the archive?</string>
  <string id="100124" soundid="154026">Then you are an oddity. Attention brings advancement, but I suppose it can draw unfortunate interest as well. Have you any questions for the archive?</string>
  <string id="100125" soundid="154027">Would you care, acolyte, to contribute your name to this record? Your alleged involvement is worthy of accolade, I&apos;m sure.</string>
  <string id="100126" soundid="154028">Greetings, young Lotus Acolyte. I am the Keeper of the Archive. What can this humble servant of the order do for you?</string>
  <string id="100127" soundid="154029">Our order has existed for twenty years. I have chronicled our new role and rise to glory. Much is mundane: minor shifts in power, the results of various campaigns.</string>
  <string id="100128" soundid="154030">True secrets are held only in the minds of Grand Inquisitor Jia and Death&apos;s Hand.</string>
  <string id="100129" soundid="154031">I will answer, within the limits of what someone of your ranking is permitted to know. Recent or old entries? You must give specifics.</string>
  <string id="100130" soundid="154032">All you are allowed to know of your masters is that Death&apos;s Hand is the will of the Emperor and Grand Inquisitor Jia rules this place for him.</string>
  <string id="100131" soundid="154033">Obey their wishes when they are made apparent to you or you will be destroyed. That is all an acolyte needs to understand.</string>
  <string id="100132" soundid="154034">You may, however, ask about your Master Gang. He is not important enough to warrant secrecy.</string>
  <string id="100133" soundid="154035">A thoroughly average Assassin relegated to indoctrinating acolytes due to his failure to demonstrate leadership qualities. He is not well liked.</string>
  <string id="100134" soundid="154036">His mediocrity is magnified by the successes of Master Shin, an Assassin who arrived at the same time and has catapulted through the ranks.</string>
  <string id="100135" soundid="154037">Coincidentally, Master Shin is the one who personally documented many of Gang&apos;s failures. There is, of course, nothing strange about this.</string>
  <string id="100136" soundid="154038">Shin is also now dead. Perhaps that will see a rise in Master Gang&apos;s fortunes. I wait to record the results.</string>
  <string id="100137" soundid="154039">He is dead, as is his superior, Master Shin. A certain acolyte may have had an influence on these matters, but both allowed themselves to appear weak.</string>
  <string id="100138" soundid="154040">No investigation into their fates is planned or likely.</string>
  <string id="100139" soundid="154041">You are permitted to know that Death&apos;s Hand returned from Dirge as the Emperor&apos;s trusted confidant after all others around him proved to be traitors.</string>
  <string id="100140" soundid="154042">After defeating the drought, the Emperor was no longer a slave to the natural order of things. He needed utterly loyal disciples to replace, and kill, doubters.</string>
  <string id="100141" soundid="154043">The Order of the Lotus was quickly transformed from its weak role under Prince Kin. Death&apos;s Hand was the new way, and those who disagreed were destroyed.</string>
  <string id="100142" soundid="154044">All who did were killed... except one who first hid his doubt. On a mission to cleanse a traitor&apos;s family, he rejected Death&apos;s Hand and turned on his fellows.</string>
  <string id="100143" soundid="154045">The bodies were unrecognizable. More have died to him over the years, but few remain who know his face. He was our most skilled, most vicious, and most hated.</string>
  <string id="100147">&lt;FullName&gt;. Make sure it is spelled right.</string>
  <string id="100148">No names. Record instead that the Assassins would soon fall to their own foolishness.</string>
  <string id="100149">Put nothing in your record about this. I am not here to garner attention.</string>
  <string id="100150">How long have you kept your archive?</string>
  <string id="100152">I want to ask about what is in the archive.</string>
  <string id="100153">Tell me about the Lotus Assassin leadership.</string>
  <string id="100156">Tell me about Master Gang.</string>
  <string id="100159">Let&apos;s go back to my other questions.</string>
  <string id="100161">Tell me about the time the order was formed.</string>
  <string id="100164">No one questioned such a brutal change?</string>
  <string id="100166">So this rogue Assassin escaped punishment?</string>
  <string id="100168">What was this rogue Assassin called?</string>
  <string id="100170">What was so different in the way you were trained?</string>
  <string id="100172">Tell me about recent campaigns. </string>
  <string id="100175">Who was this enemy?</string>
  <string id="100176">The Assassins need a historian? That cannot be your only duty.</string>
  <string id="100178">Goodbye.</string>
  <string id="100179" soundid="154081">Stop right there, acolyte. I am well aware of what that... that... Lotus Expositioner records. Rumors and lies routinely turned over to Grand Inquisitor Jia.</string>
  <string id="100180" soundid="154082">If you wish to remain more than a footnote in her pages you will not speak to me again about her. The old fool will see my potential, and you will help me.</string>
  <string id="100181">I spoke with the Keeper of the Archive about you.</string>
  <string id="100183" soundid="154085">Right now is an interesting time for an organization known as The Guild. I have no doubt that Qui has told you about us if you didn&apos;t already know.</string>
  <string id="100184" soundid="154086">Our organization is involved in many different activities, most of which operate below the view of the authorities of this great Empire.</string>
  <string id="100185" soundid="154087">Come now. We are above calling each other names, aren&apos;t we?</string>
  <string id="100186" soundid="154088">I am suggesting that we align our goals for a time. An arrangement that could benefit us both.</string>
  <string id="100187" soundid="154089">The Guild, you see, has recently developed a vacancy in its upper ecehelons. A man by the name of Gao the Greater has been killed and with his death a new leader must be chosen.</string>
  <string id="100188" soundid="154090">I intend to replace him in that role, and I need good people to back me.</string>
  <string id="100189" soundid="154091">Did you? An interesting claim, and one I&apos;m not sure I believe. You don&apos;t match the descriptions we have of the killer, but then the descriptions are fairly... tenuous.</string>
  <string id="100190" soundid="154092">You knew him? Yet you aren&apos;t associated with our organization. The logical conclusion is that you are his killer.</string>
  <string id="100191" soundid="154093">If you are the one who killed Gao, then I owe you a favor. Consider my reluctance to turn you in to the Lotus Assassins a repayment of that debt in full.</string>
  <string id="100193">You&apos;re a bunch of criminals.</string>
  <string id="100195">Are you suggesting that I join you?</string>
  <string id="100198">You realize that I&apos;m the one who eliminated Gao the Greater?</string>
  <string id="100200">You want to be a pirate backing, slave trader with an arrogant dog of a son?</string>
  <string id="100203" soundid="154105">You seem at peace with the world now. I suppose... what you&apos;ve been through could do that to a person.</string>
  <string id="100204" soundid="154106">You&apos;re right. We&apos;re going to deal with Master Li; let&apos;s make sure it&apos;s for the right reasons.</string>
  <string id="100205" soundid="154107">It seems hard to hang on to anger right now, but we must still deal with your former master. He must pay for what he has done.</string>
  <string id="100206" soundid="154108">I agree with you, though, let&apos;s deal with him for the right reasons.</string>
  <string id="100207" soundid="154109">[Success] I suppose I wasn&apos;t. Even in my darkest rage, I wouldn&apos;t have said that.</string>
  <string id="100208" soundid="154110">[Success] I suppose I wasn&apos;t. Even in my darkest rage, I wouldn&apos;t have said that.</string>
  <string id="100209" soundid="154111">[Success] You&apos;re right... about everything. Anger makes me no better than your Master.</string>
  <string id="100210" soundid="154112">[Success] You&apos;re right... about everything. Anger makes me no better than your Master.</string>
  <string id="100211" soundid="154113">[Success] Pinmei. Damn, you&apos;re right. I&apos;d grown accustomed to seeing the world as a struggle, but what you say makes perfect sense.</string>
  <string id="100212" soundid="154114">[Success] Pinmei. Damn, you&apos;re right. I&apos;d grown accustomed to seeing the world as a struggle, but what you say makes perfect sense.</string>
  <string id="100213" soundid="154115">[Failure] I&apos;m sorry, I just can&apos;t get past what your Master has done, what he tried to take from us.</string>
  <string id="100214" soundid="154116">Just remember, some of the others may not see your goals in the same light. Dawn Star leaps to the front of my mind, but the others, as well.</string>
  <string id="100215" soundid="154117">The only thing that really matters is that you made it back to me. I knew even death wouldn&apos;t stop you, my last Spirit Monk.</string>
  <string id="100216" soundid="154118">If you can tell me, I want to hear all about it... in a bit.</string>
  <string id="100217" soundid="154119">No, I made that mistake once. Never again.</string>
  <string id="100218" soundid="154120">I never did say what I wanted to before the palace, you know?</string>
  <string id="100219" soundid="154121">You had the courage to say what I wanted to, but I wasn&apos;t able to reply. Not properly.</string>
  <string id="100220" soundid="154122">Actually, you did know, and you told me so, which was kind.</string>
  <string id="100221" soundid="154123">Of course you did. You even gave me a second chance to spit it out.</string>
  <string id="100222" soundid="154124">When I heard you were.... I knew I&apos;d missed my chance to tell you I had fallen in love with you.</string>
  <string id="100223" soundid="154125">I would never have expected this, but you and I... we&apos;re more than companions. I didn&apos;t get a chance to tell you that....</string>
  <string id="100224" soundid="154126">That you were in my every thought. That whenever I could, I kept you in my sight just to know you were there. That you had become everything.</string>
  <string id="100225" soundid="154127">When you fell, it was like a part of me shattered. I thought that piece would be broken forever, but... we have another chance. I love you, and I never want to let you go.</string>
  <string id="100226" soundid="154128">That I&apos;m in love with you? Gladly, but there&apos;s something we should do first. Come here.</string>
  <string id="100227" soundid="154129">I was just getting to that part, but as my lady wishes....</string>
  <string id="100228" soundid="154130">Absolutely.</string>
  <string id="100229" soundid="154131">It&apos;s quiet tonight. It won&apos;t last. Your Master has already unleashed his hounds.</string>
  <string id="100230" soundid="154132">At least we got here first. I don&apos;t like to think of you walking out of that gate and into their arms.</string>
  <string id="100231" soundid="154133">I would need a dastardly clever plan to get you out of that.</string>
  <string id="100232" soundid="154134">The slaughter might have put Whirlwind to shame if I had to fight my way to you.</string>
  <string id="100233" soundid="154135">I thought about our discussion earlier. Remember, I was asking you about the future and what you wanted for yourself when all this was done?</string>
  <string id="100234" soundid="154136">You talked about starting a school and finding some peace there. It might seem strange, but I think you&apos;re the kind of person who would fight for that peace.</string>
  <string id="100235" soundid="154137">You wanted to learn more about your people, remember? That clicked when Dawn Star mentioned Dirge, and I knew you were fighting your way back.</string>
  <string id="100236" soundid="154138">You swore you wouldn&apos;t rest until you&apos;d destroyed those responsible for what had happened.</string>
  <string id="100237" soundid="154139">You were joking when you said you&apos;d try and settle down with some dashing rogue, but since then, you&apos;ve seemed more serious.</string>
  <string id="100238" soundid="154140">I remember you saying you wanted to rest after all this ended. Somehow, I suspected you wouldn&apos;t consider what happened the &quot;end.&quot;</string>
  <string id="100239" soundid="154141">When Dawn Star began having visions, I just knew that you were fighting your way back. What else could she be seeing?</string>
  <string id="100240" soundid="154142">So we followed, and here we are, with the new Emperor&apos;s army on the way. I don&apos;t know how we&apos;ll survive, but we&apos;ll find a way.</string>
  <string id="100241" soundid="154143">Since you&apos;ve... returned, you&apos;re stronger than you ever were before. There&apos;s no denying the truth of what you say.</string>
  <string id="100242" soundid="154144">You&apos;re so angry when you say that. There&apos;s no more hope for your Master in your eyes? I mean he must be stopped, but....</string>
  <string id="100243" soundid="154145">[Success] Then you shall have it. Sun Li will pay for trying to take you away from me.</string>
  <string id="100244" soundid="154146">[Success] You&apos;re right. If he would do that to his own student, then I can&apos;t imagine what he would do the Empire.</string>
  <string id="100245" soundid="154147">We will stop him, if it takes tearing his heart out.</string>
  <string id="100246" soundid="154148">[Success] You&apos;re right. He really was behind it all, wasn&apos;t he? Damn him. If only we&apos;d known. Oh well, this new Emperor will learn his lesson soon enough.</string>
  <string id="100247" soundid="154149">[Failure] I understand how you feel, but I won&apos;t give up hope for your Master just yet.</string>
  <string id="100248" soundid="154150">Whatever it takes. I&apos;ll be there with you until the end.</string>
  <string id="100249" soundid="154151">When we followed, I knew there was still a chance that you&apos;d come back for revenge.</string>
  <string id="100250" soundid="154152">When you&apos;re ready, I&apos;ll stand beside you. We will crush Emperor Li, and if you want his power, I will be there to help you take it.</string>
  <string id="100251" soundid="154153">I have noticed something different about you. No less skill or determination, but less of an edge.</string>
  <string id="100254">You seemed less surprised than the others when I stepped through.</string>
  <string id="100255">Why were you so sure I&apos;d be coming back?</string>
  <string id="100263">Forget survival. This is about making Sun Li pay for what he has done.</string>
  <string id="100265">[Charm] You and I have great things ahead of us, Sky, but I need your strength.</string>
  <string id="100267">[Intimidation] You don&apos;t care that he struck me down? I need your help to destroy him, Sky.</string>
  <string id="100270">[Intuition] He was behind everything, Sky. All the loss. I need you to harden your heart.</string>
  <string id="100273">There is a way, we just have to find it.</string>
  <string id="100274">No one else can stop Master Li, but I can&apos;t do it alone.</string>
  <string id="100277">Some things have changed. I&apos;m not that interested in power anymore.</string>
  <string id="100281">[Charm] You weren&apos;t like that when I met you, Sky.</string>
  <string id="100282">[Intimidation] I need you with me, Sky, not questioning me.</string>
  <string id="100283">[Intuition] Would your daughter want to hear you sounding like that? Let go of the anger.</string>
  <string id="100285">You&apos;re right, Sky. Neither of us can afford to forget what Sun Li has done.</string>
  <string id="100286">It&apos;s good to know I can trust you to help me, whatever happens.</string>
  <string id="100287">I&apos;m not sure how, but I&apos;ll find a way to tear my Master&apos;s heart from his chest.</string>
  <string id="100289">I did. It wasn&apos;t easy.</string>
  <string id="100291">That&apos;s all you have to say?</string>
  <string id="100300">I liked that. Say that again.</string>
  <string id="100301">You leave me no choice, Sky. I&apos;m going to have to kiss you now.</string>
  <string id="100302">Let&apos;s make sure we don&apos;t waste that chance.</string>
  <string id="100303">For tonight, let&apos;s forget about the army. We have some... catching up to do.</string>
  <string id="100304">We each have our path, Zu. I will listen when you are ready.</string>
  <string id="100305">There will be no one else able to assist. I am destined for this.</string>
  <string id="100306">Bah! You fear him, but I have skill you do not. I don&apos;t need to know anything else.</string>
  <string id="100307" soundid="154304">We will not allow you keep these people!</string>
  <string id="100308" soundid="154305">You can&apos;t be serious?</string>
  <string id="100309" soundid="154306">These people have done nothing!</string>
  <string id="100310" soundid="154307">You seriously contemplate this?</string>
  <string id="100317">The man leading the bandits seemed to know Master Li.</string>
  <string id="100320" soundid="154572">Lotus Assassins? It makes no sense. Why would they be here? It must have just been a bandit. You should really ask Master Li, though. Such things aren&apos;t mine to discuss.</string>
  <string id="100321" soundid="154318">You look to be worth about a silver and a half. What do we need to prove to you?</string>
  <string id="100323" soundid="154320">Do you think yourself worthy of making such a demand? What proof are you worthy of?</string>
  <string id="100324" soundid="154321">A foolish, foolish mistake. You have no idea.</string>
  <string id="100326" soundid="154488">He doesn&apos;t come close to Master Li&apos;s skill, but Smiling Mountain is good for the younger students. He pairs novices and more advanced students so we can learn.</string>
  <string id="100329" soundid="154326">You will not keep them this way!</string>
  <string id="100330" soundid="154327">These people are not cattle for you!</string>
  <string id="100331" soundid="154328">They are not animals for you to imprison!</string>
  <string id="100335" soundid="154332">He thinks it&apos;s too tough, but impossible odds make the best fights.</string>
  <string id="100337" soundid="154334">We won&apos;t allow you to use them this way!</string>
  <string id="100338" soundid="154335">It is not your place to decide for these people.</string>
  <string id="100339" soundid="154336">They will be free of your cages.</string>
  <string id="100340" soundid="154337">Yes, what do you have to say to that? You want to fight, right?</string>
  <string id="100341" soundid="154338">You&apos;d betray them this way?</string>
  <string id="100342" soundid="154339">Even fighting for themselves, at least they have a chance.</string>
  <string id="100351" soundid="154348">It would be no less than you deserve.</string>
  <string id="100352" soundid="154349">It is justice... of a sort.</string>
  <string id="100353" soundid="154350">I think they might even enjoy it.</string>
  <string id="100354" soundid="154351">A truly practical approach that most people I&apos;m sure find lacking.</string>
  <string id="100359" soundid="154356">If a man can&apos;t earn his own freedom, he does not deserve it.</string>
  <string id="100360" soundid="154357">Never doubt when someone gives their word.</string>

  <string id="100784" soundid="155181">You have a keen and observant eye, mighty Fang. I have brought you a gift... a small token of my esteem for you.</string>
  <string id="100785">This is it!</string>
  <string id="100786">Now we see!</string>
  <string id="100787" soundid="155184">Turtle&apos;s eggs! What is the meaning of this, Sheng? You dare mock me with this... this... insult!</string>
  <string id="100788" soundid="155185">N-no... there must be some mistake....</string>
  <string id="100789" soundid="155186">I understand all too well, Sheng. These eggs are your way of getting back at me for assigning you to Tien&apos;s Landing. But *I* will have the last laugh, Sheng!</string>
  <string id="100790" soundid="155187">I banish you to Tien&apos;s Landing! Wait there until I summon you back to the Imperial City. It shouldn&apos;t take more than a decade... or two.</string>
  <string id="100791" soundid="155188">W-wait... Judge Fang... please, come back! I... I... no!!</string>
  <string id="100792" soundid="155189">You... you did this to me! You have disgraced Minister Sheng. I am doomed to remain trapped at my wretched post in Tien&apos;s Landing forever!</string>
  <string id="100793" soundid="155190">No... Minister Sheng will not accept this! Judge Fang has not heard my report yet. I will not return to Tien&apos;s Landing without giving my report!</string>
  <string id="100794" soundid="155191">I refuse to abandon the glories of the Imperial City. I simply won&apos;t leave. You can&apos;t make me. Nobody can! Minister Sheng will not be moved!</string>
  <string id="100796">More!</string>
  <string id="100798">Take this!</string>
  <string id="100803">My style is perfect!</string>
  <string id="100813">The what now?</string>
  <string id="100814">Perish, fool!</string>
  <string id="100815">Get over here.</string>
  <string id="100816">Fist meets face.</string>
  <string id="100817">One more for the road!</string>
  <string id="100818">Stand still, you!</string>
  <string id="100819">Hurry up and die!</string>
  <string id="100824">(Muffled belch)</string>
  <string id="100825">Wrong brew!</string>
  <string id="100826">That&apos;ll stain you.</string>
  <string id="100827" soundid="155241">You don&apos;t know anything about how the Imperial Arena works. Why don&apos;t you go find out?</string>
  <string id="100828" soundid="155242">Ha! I sounded like you when I first got here. Now I&apos;m finished for good. Learn about this fine Imperial Arena yourself, why don&apos;t you?</string>
  <string id="100829" soundid="155243">You think you&apos;re tough enough for the Imperial Arena, do you? Why not prove it. I&apos;ll never be allowed to fight in here again, that&apos;s for sure.</string>
  <string id="100830" soundid="155244">Guess my spot in the roster is yours if you want it. Go find Qui the Promoter if you think you can fill my shoes.</string>
  <string id="100831" soundid="155245">He&apos;s always upstairs in the third room over or so, and looking for new blood. I&apos;m taking what I have left from my winnings and leaving.</string>
  <string id="100832">What just happened?</string>
  <string id="100834">Sounds to me like you got what you deserved.</string>
  <string id="100836">You&apos;re going to take that? Get up there and stand up for yourself!</string>
  <string id="100838">Step away from me, mongrel. Your weakness disgusts me.</string>
  <string id="100872" soundid="155288">I can do no more.... I must fade. Pity those spirits that have grown twisted. You will come to know their pain when life leaves you.</string>
  <string id="100880">Outlaw</string>
  <string id="100883" soundid="155299">You should talk to the other fighters here, they&apos;ve been watching you and are getting nervous. Of course, I&apos;ll need more time than that for these preparations.</string>
  <string id="100884" soundid="155300">It&apos;s just a matter of preparing the proper documents. Why don&apos;t you kill the time by making your way out into the city? See the sights! Maybe visit the Golden Way or the Scholars&apos; Garden.</string>
  <string id="100885" soundid="155301">Actually, that reminds me: a woman was here watching your fight against Hapless Han. Dressed all in black and veiled. She seemed impressed with your preferance.</string>
  <string id="100886" soundid="155302">Just before she left, she told me to tell my new fighter that, &quot;she was still waiting to see you.&quot; She said you&apos;d know where. Sounds like quite the invitation!</string>
  <string id="100888" soundid="155304">Bai the Outcrier stands outside the arena and usually knows all sorts of interesting things that are pericollating in other parts of the city!</string>
  <string id="100889" soundid="155305">By the time you see some of the sights and get back here I should have things ready to go for your Bronze Division debut!</string>
  <string id="100890" soundid="155306">Your next fight? I&apos;d love to, but I&apos;m still arranging the details of your entry into the Bronze Division.</string>
  <string id="100891" soundid="155307">Besides, didn&apos;t you have some mysterious lady in black looking to meet you? Hardly an invitation I&apos;d turn down!</string>
  <string id="100892" soundid="155308">Go on and get some fresh air. Go see the Golden Way, pester the scholars or even bother the students at the Black Leopard School! I still need a bit more time to arrange things.</string>
  <string id="100894">What kind of preparations?</string>
  <string id="100895">I can&apos;t fight now?</string>
  <string id="101006" soundid="155434">They attacked and were overmatched. If I let them go, they might return a greater threat. You must know this simple tactic; I&apos;ve seen you training in your village.</string>
  <string id="101007">You fought without mercy. Why should I trust you?</string>
  <string id="101101" soundid="188173"></string>
  <string id="101102">Kin was made Death&apos;s Hand after you abandoned him. I&apos;ll restore his true self!</string>
  <string id="101108" soundid="155538">You might also want to keep an eye out for some small shrines that are scattered about the forest. Some of them are said to react to magic or charges of chi.</string>
  <string id="101109" soundid="155539">It is said that these shrines react when users of chi focus their inner magics upon them. They light the path for pilgrims in the darkest nights.</string>
  <string id="101110" soundid="155540">The ghosts in this forest seem to shy away from the light. It&apos;s possible that these shrines might drive them away for a time, or possibly weaken them.</string>
  <string id="101112">What is the purpose of these shrines you mentioned?</string>
  <string id="101114" soundid="155558">Talk to my acolytes at their stations in the golem press room and the Soul Extractor. These are dangerous machines, find a sharp corner Shin can crack his temple on.</string>
  <string id="101115" soundid="155559">I seen no movement in your plan to distract the press operator, clear the hall of witnesses, and stop the slave shipment arriving from outside in the Necropolis.</string>
  <string id="101116" soundid="155560">Only after all that is done will Shin be vulnerable. Of course, I cannot be involved.</string>
  <string id="101117">You found Dawn Star in discussion with Gao the Lesser, who was his usual arrogant self. Having already heard about the bandits from Master Li, Dawn Star has joined you to aid with the defense of the town.</string>
  <string id="101120">Let&apos;s talk about the plan to kill Shin.</string>
  <string id="101124">You have slain Miss Chan and her spirit no longer roams the Necropolis. Surely Shen will give you a reward for ridding him of this problem.</string>

  <string id="101134">Defeat Bai&apos;s Tormentors</string>
  <string id="101135">Defeat the ghosts that torment Merchant Bai.</string>
  <string id="101136">Merchant Bai is being tormented by the ghosts of the two brothers that killed him in life. Apparently they were buried in the Necropolis, as well, and they have risen to torment him. He cannot rest in his fear and anguish. He says you can find them in an underground tomb immediately to the south.</string>

  <string id="101150">Vengeance Served Cold</string>
  <string id="101151">Bring peace to Mister Ren.</string>
  <string id="101152">You have encountered the spirit of Mister Ren, who has sworn vengeance against his wife, Ren Feng. He does not seem to be able to rest until this vengeance is carried out.</string>
  <string id="101154">A Misunderstanding</string>
  <string id="101155">Bring peace to Mister Ren.</string>
  <string id="101156">You have spoken to Ren Feng, the wife of the poisoned Mister Ren. She claims that the poisoning which led to his death was accidental, and that it was just some bad fish she bought. It is doubtful that Mister Ren will believe this.</string>
  <string id="101158">Vengeance is Served</string>
  <string id="101159">Return to Mister Ren with news of his wife&apos;s death.</string>
  <string id="101160">You have killed Ren Feng, the woman Mister Ren says poisoned and murdered him. With this news, his spirit should be able to lie peaceful once more.</string>

  <string id="101163">Return with Ren Feng to Mister Ren&apos;s ghost.</string>
  <string id="101164">Mister Ren wouldn&apos;t believe his wife&apos;s innocence unless he heard it from her own mouth. Bring her back to him, and help her explain that his death was an accident.</string>

  <string id="101167">Return to Shen and tell him that Mister Ren lies peacefully once more.</string>
  <string id="101168">Return to Shen and tell him that Mister Ren&apos;s ghost lies peacefully and won&apos;t trouble him again. He should give you the reward that he has promised you.</string>

  <string id="101176">Mister Ren has been banished for good, and his annoying wife silenced as well. Mister Ren won&apos;t be coming back, and Ren Feng could be safely tossed in a discrete pit somewhere. Return and get your reward from Shen, and hope he doesn&apos;t charge you for the extra burial.</string>

  <string id="101191">Find the Elder Tanner Fong and return him to his grave in the Necropolis. According to his son, he&apos;s &quot;invaded&quot; the family home.</string>
  <string id="101192">Shen has told you that the corpse of the Elder Tanner Fong has risen from its grave and wandered off, returning to his home. His son, who inherited the home, is none too pleased. He wants a refund or the corpse gone, and Shen doesn&apos;t like refunds.</string>
  <string id="101194">Remove the Elder</string>
  <string id="101195">Stop the Elder Tanner Fong&apos;s hauntings of his family home in the Market District.</string>

  <string id="101199">Resolve the Elder Tanner Fong&apos;s problem.</string>
  <string id="101200">The Elder Tanner Fong isn&apos;t dead! His greedy son buried him while he was in a deep sleep. Now he&apos;s believed to be a ghost, and no one will come near him. The only place he has left is his home. He wants you to help him reclaim his life and confront his son.</string>
  <string id="101203">Exiled</string>
  <string id="101206">The Elder Tanner Fong has been taken in by Shen and put to work digging graves in the Necropolis. At least he&apos;ll have a few more years of productivity before he really does die.</string>
  <string id="101207">Talk to Younger Tanner Fong</string>
  <string id="101208">Speak to Younger Tanner Fong about his father&apos;s death.</string>
  <string id="101209">You have eliminated the problem by eliminating Elder Tanner Fong. His son will likely be happy with the news.</string>

  <string id="101211">Finish Them</string>
  <string id="101212">Against foes like these, your victory should be flawless.</string>
  <string id="101213">Perhaps tired of dealing with the questions of life and death, you&apos;ve decided to take matters into your own hand.</string>

  <string id="101273" soundid="155771">To succeed, everything must be in place. The hall cleared of all witnesses, the press operator distracted, and the slave shipment stopped outside in the Necropolis.</string>

  <string id="101416">Suffer!</string>
  <string id="101417">Your life ends here!</string>
  <string id="101418">Taste death!</string>
  <string id="101419">You won&apos;t walk away!</string>
  <string id="101420">Death&apos;s too good for you.</string>
  <string id="101425">That&apos;s better.</string>
  <string id="101426">Cursed poisoner!</string>
  <string id="101427">Hurts, doesn&apos;t it?</string>
  <string id="101428" soundid="155987"></string>
  <string id="101430">That was useless!</string>
  <string id="101431">You stand no chance!</string>
  <string id="101432">Your life will be pain.</string>
  <string id="101433">Just give up now.</string>
  <string id="101434">It&apos;d be easier to lie down and die!</string>
  <string id="101435">We&apos;ll drink to your bones!</string>
  <string id="101436">Pathetic!</string>
  <string id="101441">Ahhh.</string>
  <string id="101442">It&apos;s in my blood.</string>
  <string id="101443">You&apos;re barely worth the effort!</string>
  <string id="101455">Clay Golem</string>
  <string id="101458">Clay Golem</string>
  <string id="101461">Clay Golem</string>
  <string id="101464">Yes, I will go in alone.</string>
  <string id="101465">No, I am not ready yet.</string>
  <string id="101477" soundid="156096">No, it has to be you! You... you&apos;re here, and someone has to help now!</string>
  <string id="101478" soundid="156097">My son was playing there, behind the arena, and he fell into the pits where the creatures are. I can&apos;t save him!</string>
  <string id="101479" soundid="156098">They took my boy and said I had to find you and lead you into an ambush or they would kill him.</string>
  <string id="101484">Let&apos;s go save your son.</string>
  <string id="101485">Let them try their little ambush. I&apos;ll kill the scum as fast as they come.</string>
  <string id="101486" soundid="156106">Don&apos;t forget his senior student. They say she&apos;s the one who fought many of those bandits.</string>
  <string id="101487" soundid="156107">I don&apos;t follow the school, which one are you talking about?</string>
  <string id="101488" soundid="156108">How could you miss her? She&apos;s the one in purple with the long hair. Must break some hearts with looks like hers.</string>
  <string id="101489" soundid="156109">How could you not know her? She&apos;s the one in the red and blue outfit with her hair always done up. I bet the young men she trains with haven&apos;t missed her.</string>
  <string id="101490" soundid="156110">What? She&apos;s the one in the deep blue outfit with those graceful long sleeves. My wife always yells at me for staring when she walks past!</string>
  <string id="101491" soundid="156111">As strong as she is beautiful, from what I hear.</string>
  <string id="101492" soundid="156112">They say she&apos;s as fast as lightning cutting across the sky when she fights.</string>
  <string id="101493" soundid="156113">From what I hear, her chi is stronger than that of any other in the school.</string>
  <string id="101494" soundid="156114">I once heard Master Li say that she was one of the best all-around fighters he&apos;d ever seen, like her style had no real weaknesses. Impressive, that.</string>
  <string id="101495" soundid="156115">Don&apos;t forget his senior student. They say he&apos;s the one who dealt with many of the bandits.</string>
  <string id="101496" soundid="156116">Wait, which one do you mean? Surely not that arrogant Gao boy?</string>
  <string id="101497" soundid="156117">Oh heavens no! No, he&apos;s the tall one with those rippling muscles and that long tail in his hair. Hard to miss, that&apos;s for sure.</string>
  <string id="101498" soundid="156118">Don&apos;t be silly! He&apos;s the one with that marvelous dragon tattoo on his back. He must have quite a few young ladies pining after him by now.</string>
  <string id="101499" soundid="156119">Are you crazed? No, he&apos;s the cute one in the blue vest with the yellow sash. Trust me, if you were a young woman in this village you&apos;d know who he was.</string>
  <string id="101500" soundid="156120">Gao? Of course not! No, he&apos;s the one in those striking robes with his hair shaved off. He&apos;s a handsome devil, that one!</string>
  <string id="101501" soundid="156121">They say he&apos;s incredibly strong and can outlast almost anyone in the school. </string>
  <string id="101502" soundid="156122">I saw him fight once, and he was quicker than the wind in spring.</string>
  <string id="101503" soundid="156123">I overheard one of the other students say that he could channel his chi like no one else they&apos;d ever seen.</string>
  <string id="101504" soundid="156124">I once heard Master Li say that he was one of most adept students he&apos;d ever seen, as if he had no real weakness while fighting</string>
  <string id="101505" soundid="166264">Dawn Star, there you are. I... I know I haven&apos;t spoken to you in a while. I saw him again last night, and I remembered what you said. I wasn&apos;t as afraid.</string>
  <string id="101506" soundid="166265">I&apos;m glad, Mrs. Jong.</string>
  <string id="101507" soundid="166266">He seemed... peaceful, if a bit... lost. But I know it&apos;s not your fault now. I am sorry for disturbing you, and for what I said before.</string>
  <string id="101508" soundid="166267">Remember Jong Jin, her son? He drowned last year after the mooring she tied let go. A sad accident. I saw his spirit and told her. She thought I was calling up ghosts.</string>
  <string id="101509" soundid="166268">Some spirits return because of trauma, to rectify something that disturbed them in life or death. They are very focused. When the pain is gone, they find rest.</string>
  <string id="101510" soundid="166269">At least, they are supposed to. Jin&apos;s spirit told his mother the accident wasn&apos;t her fault. Now he wanders, unconnected to this world and unable to pass to the next.</string>
  <string id="101511" soundid="166270">Troubled spirits can be set to rest for a time, but unless the greater problem is corrected, it seems all dead are destined to wander until they go mad.</string>
  <string id="101512" soundid="166271">I&apos;m sorry. This has been difficult. I don&apos;t want to think about how it affects... specific people. I&apos;m still not sure I should have told Mrs. Jong about her child.</string>
  <string id="101513" soundid="166272">I don&apos;t know. People just want to be left alone with their grief.</string>
  <string id="101514" soundid="166273">I guess blame is easier to understand than chance. Come on, we should go see if the students are all right.</string>
  <string id="101515" soundid="166274">Master Li will be waiting.</string>
  <string id="101516" soundid="166275">She wouldn&apos;t. She would rather blame herself than seek solace.</string>
  <string id="101517" soundid="166276">Sometimes I wonder. People can be so shallow.</string>
  <string id="101526" soundid="156147">I&apos;ll wait out front with the others if you need me. Be careful, I don&apos;t trust this situation at all.</string>
  <string id="101527" soundid="156148">This whole &quot;alone&quot; things smells fishier than week-old crab cakes. If something comes up, I&apos;ll be waiting outside with the others. Be careful!</string>
  <string id="101528" soundid="156149">This is almost sad. Am I truly so threatening to the mighty Kai Lan the Serpent? Regardless, I&apos;ll be waiting with the others if you need me.</string>
  <string id="101529" soundid="156150">Be wary. Kai Lan could either be a strong ally or your worst enemy. If anything goes wrong, I&apos;ll be waiting with the others, and not far off.</string>
  <string id="101530" soundid="156151">I don&apos;t like that they won&apos;t let me come in there with you. Be careful, and call if you need to. I&apos;ll wait with the others.</string>
  <string id="101531" soundid="156152">Be sure to come out ahead of whatever deal he offers you. I&apos;ll be with the others if you need me.</string>
  <string id="101532" soundid="156153">Suit yourself. I wouldn&apos;t keep the Serpent waiting long if I were you, but then, I value the use of my legs.</string>
  <string id="101536" soundid="156158"></string>
  <string id="101540" soundid="156162"></string>
  <string id="101542" soundid="156164"></string>
  <string id="101543">Heart of Gold</string>
  <string id="101544">Slave</string>
  <string id="101547">Slave</string>
  <string id="101551" soundid="156173">So, would you like to hear about the mission I have for you? Or did you want to have a look at the flyer parts again?</string>
  <string id="101552" soundid="156174">You are back! Would you like to hear about this mission I have for you? Or maybe look at some upgrades for your flyer?</string>
  <string id="101553" soundid="156175"></string>
  <string id="101558" soundid="156193">Come on, you louts. You&apos;ll be scrubbing the dining room floors for your part in this little altercation.</string>
  <string id="101561" soundid="156196">Damn it! Get her... and don&apos;t be gentle!</string>
  <string id="101562" soundid="156213">If you have a grievance with these... fine members of Shin&apos;s entourage, I can have nothing to do with it. Nothing.</string>
  <string id="101563" soundid="156214">I warned you not to appear too skilled. This is between you and Shin&apos;s Attendants. I just do my job. I want no part of this.</string>
  <string id="101564" soundid="156215">Go on then. Let&apos;s see how you fare. We&apos;ll need to sluice the blood out of there by the time they manage to destroy those ghosts.</string>
  <string id="101565" soundid="156216">Go on. Join your other useless acolytes in death.</string>
  <string id="101566" soundid="156217">Hrm... so, Gang has an acolyte who can fight.</string>
  <string id="101567" soundid="156218">Ghosts are mindless. I see no real skill in defeating them.</string>
  <string id="101568" soundid="156219">Yes, certainly. Against a real opponent there would be no doubt of the outcome.</string>
  <string id="101569" soundid="156220">Slink back to Master Gang. We answer to Master Shin, and if you are lucky, this is the last time you will see us.</string>
  <string id="101570" soundid="156221">Leave us, acolyte. We serve Master Shin, not your fool master.</string>
  <string id="101571" soundid="156222">So, you are the new trainer. You think you have something to show us? Master Shin has us *test* each of Gang&apos;s trainers to make sure they are skilled.</string>
  <string id="101572" soundid="156223">But not too skilled. Am I your next student? I assure you, I am more than capable of defending myself. I was made an Attendant because of my... skills.</string>
  <string id="101573" soundid="156224">Oh, don&apos;t worry about me. Worry about yourself. Let&apos;s move this fight to the Hall of Induction, so I have room to enjoy this.</string>
  <string id="101574" soundid="156225">Is that so? I would be more concerned about yourself if I were you. Let&apos;s move this fight to the Hall of Induction, so I have room to enjoy this.</string>
  <string id="101575" soundid="156226">You think to persuade us to abandon Master Shin and join Gang&apos;s pathetic faction? Then you know nothing about how true acolytes are indoctrinated.</string>
  <string id="101576" soundid="156227">Our lives belong to Master Shin. Through his guidance, we will one day ascend to serve Grand Inquisitor Jia and Death&apos;s Hand.</string>
  <string id="101577" soundid="156228">Our loyalty is absolute. We are nothing without our duty to Master Shin. Perhaps Gang is more lenient and left your mind untouched, but that is why he is weak.</string>
  <string id="101578" soundid="156229">I&apos;ll be waiting.</string>
  <string id="101579" soundid="156230">Ah, you gather the courage to return. Come to teach us something, hmm?</string>
  <string id="101580" soundid="156231">I&apos;m ready for my lesson. If you think you are good enough.</string>
  <string id="101581" soundid="156232">You... you killed Kitan. The life of an acolyte is forfeit when they walk into this place, yes, but for one of Gang&apos;s ragged minions to do this is unforgivable.</string>
  <string id="101582" soundid="156233">Do you think you can make such an insult and disguise it as a simple training mishap? You are a fool.</string>
  <string id="101583" soundid="156234">If you are ready, trainer, your next student is waiting. It is my task to make examples of Gang&apos;s acolytes who show too much promise.</string>
  <string id="101584" soundid="156235">My skills are above question. Gang is about to lose another of his pitiful acolytes. Come, let&apos;s move to the hall, and I will end this.</string>
  <string id="101585" soundid="156236">Master Shin is our guiding light. We serve his glory, and through him, we will come to serve Grand Inquisitor Jia and Death&apos;s Hand.</string>
  <string id="101586" soundid="156237">Our loyalty is absolute. You would know this if Gang properly indoctrinated his acolytes, but he does not, so he is weak.</string>
  <string id="101587" soundid="156238">On your own time, trainer. Your cowardice is as much a lesson as whatever will happen to you during our bout.</string>
  <string id="101590">You force my hand. Come, Attendants, I will fight you all.</string>
  <string id="101591">Numbers mean nothing, Attendants. I will destroy you all!</string>
  <string id="101592">Master Gang, will you not assist me?</string>
  <string id="101594">Acolyte Trainer Guang, will you assist me?</string>
  <string id="101599">[Lie] I will make certain nothing goes wrong during our bout.</string>
  <string id="101600">You better be competent. If not, you might have an *accident.*</string>
  <string id="101601">Perhaps we could come to some sort of arrangement.</string>
  <string id="101604">I&apos;ll come back later when I&apos;m ready to begin.</string>
  <string id="101608">I am ready. Come, Kai Feng, let us see how skilled you are.</string>
  <string id="101609">We do not have to fight. We can come to an agreement.</string>
  <string id="101611">I&apos;ll be ready soon enough. You can wait for now.</string>
  <string id="101619" soundid="156270">You can also seek training from Acolyte Trainer Guang. I am sure you are her superior, but she might have something of use to you.</string>
  <string id="101620" soundid="156271">I am sure I can count on you.</string>
  <string id="101621" soundid="156272">Have you not been paying attention? I cannot act directly against Master Shin! If I do, we are all dead. It is that simple.</string>
  <string id="101622" soundid="156273">Acolytes falling to other acolytes is to be expected. It is how the weak are filtered out. My actions would make it a war.</string>
  <string id="101624">Why didn&apos;t you help against Shin&apos;s Attendants?</string>
  <string id="101626" soundid="156277">An acolyte of Gang&apos;s, hmm? So am I. Let&apos;s identify what training you need by sparring for a short time.</string>
  <string id="101627" soundid="156278">Let&apos;s keep it non-lethal for now. You&apos;ll find you have enough enemies in this place. We acolytes are utterly expendable.</string>
  <string id="101628" soundid="156279">Attendant Kitan, as I said. She is with the rest of Shin&apos;s entourage by the doors to the inner chambers.</string>
  <string id="101629" soundid="156280">Your next student has been chosen for you. I did warn you that appearing too strong would put you in danger. Well, beware this next Attendant.</string>
  <string id="101630" soundid="156281">Attendant Kai Feng is waiting for you with his remaining fellows at the doors to the inner chambers. I wish you luck.</string>
  <string id="101631" soundid="156282">As I said, Attendant Kai Feng is waiting for you at the doors to the inner chamber. Be careful.</string>
  <string id="101632" soundid="156283">I have learned a number of techniques.</string>
  <string id="101633" soundid="156284">I showed my ability in the arena, and when I asked, their recruiter agreed. I have only one skill, and this was the best place to exploit it.</string>
  <string id="101634" soundid="156285">Combat. Killing. The army was too strict... the arena too tame. Here, when they want an enemy destroyed, that enemy is destroyed... sometimes family and all.</string>
  <string id="101635" soundid="156286">We are all here for one reason, and that includes you. We are killers, plain and simple. There are no Lotus Assassins with hearts of gold.</string>
  <string id="101636" soundid="156287">Goodbye. If you wish to begin your likely short career as trainer, Attendant Kitan waits with her fellows at the doors to the inner chambers.</string>
  <string id="101637" soundid="156288">Goodbye. Your next, and likely final, training partner is waiting by the inner chamber doors. Attendant Kai Feng. Do not hold back. Good luck.</string>
  <string id="101638" soundid="156289">Goodbye, acolyte.</string>
  <string id="101639" soundid="156290">You! Assist her, if you can even do that.</string>
  <string id="101640" soundid="156291">Greetings, acolyte. I believe I was supposed to be your trainer, but... given the rather remarkable deaths that have occurred, I&apos;m sure you don&apos;t need my help.</string>
  <string id="101641" soundid="156292">I still have some training techniques and resources I can share, but we may as well dispense with formality. What do you need?</string>
  <string id="101642" soundid="156293">You are either brave or foolish. I warned you that appearing too strong would make you a target of Shin&apos;s Attendants. Actually killing one will incite them further.</string>
  <string id="101643" soundid="156294">I would be very careful if you intend on continuing to train the others. They will not let the death of Kitan go unanswered.</string>
  <string id="101644" soundid="156295">What? That is your plan? I wish you luck, but I&apos;m staying well out of the way. This is going to get really ugly.</string>
  <string id="101645" soundid="156296">I marvel at your ability. You show no fear of the enemies you make. You will do well here.</string>
  <string id="101646" soundid="156297">You have no more acolytes to train for now. Is there anything else you need?</string>
  <string id="101647" soundid="156298">How can I assist you?</string>
  <string id="101648" soundid="156299">Good. Remember, no killing blows. I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll have plenty of time to practice those later.</string>
  <string id="101649" soundid="156300">Return when you are. This initial test will tell me what you need to learn. I won&apos;t train you without some idea of your capabilities. It&apos;s a waste of time.</string>
  <string id="101650" soundid="156301">Are you ready to spar? It&apos;s hard to know what you need to learn without seeing what you already know.</string>
  <string id="101651" soundid="156302">What&apos;s that? I thought I had found something special, but if that acolyte can&apos;t beat a trainer, I&apos;ll look elsewhere for a favored student.</string>
  <string id="101652" soundid="156303">Bah! Finish him off. I don&apos;t have time for this.</string>
  <string id="101653" soundid="156304">I am sorry. Master&apos;s orders.</string>
  <string id="101654" soundid="156305">Bah! Finish her off. I don&apos;t have time for this.</string>
  <string id="101655" soundid="156306">Well, you would appear to have more than a passing knowledge of combat. I could almost see some kind of flaw, but I was clearly outclassed.</string>
  <string id="101656" soundid="156307">Yes, you were! I knew this acolyte was something special, but I didn&apos;t think my trainer would be made to look like a fool!</string>
  <string id="101657" soundid="156308">You, new-blood, you will be the trainer now. When I am promoted, you will train all my acolytes.</string>
  <string id="101658" soundid="156309">You! Assist him, if you can even do that.</string>
  <string id="101659" soundid="156310">It would seem that you have taken over my duties. I will still serve as an advisor, as Master Gang ordered. There are techniques I can share.</string>
  <string id="101660" soundid="156311">In truth I did not like being a trainer. Life for any of Master Gang&apos;s acolytes is rough and short, but especially so for trainers. Master Shin sees to that.</string>
  <string id="101661" soundid="156312">My duties--your duties now--include training Master Shin&apos;s personal entourage. In the past, if a trainer was too good, Shin had that trainer killed to keep Gang weak.</string>
  <string id="101662" soundid="156313">I think one member of his entourage is a full Lotus Assassin. I have survived by appearing unimportant, and staying out of the fight between Gang and Shin.</string>
  <string id="101663" soundid="156314">You are supposed to train the Attendants in his entourage. Some need it, but if you seem too skilled, your next fight will be against the hidden Lotus Assassin.</string>
  <string id="101664" soundid="168010">If you&apos;re dead set on losing your life down in the lowest tombs, I won&apos;t stop you. I won&apos;t save you, either.</string>
  <string id="101665" soundid="156316">Besides, it wouldn&apos;t weaken Shin for long. I suppose he would be alone and more vulnerable if he had to fight right away, but he will replace them in time.</string>
  <string id="101666" soundid="156317">Accidents happen, and even the attendants in his entourage are just acolytes, and therefore are utterly expendable. There would not be much fuss.</string>
  <string id="101667" soundid="156318">However, you would probably find yourself training the hidden Lotus Assassin in the next bout. Any skilled acolytes under Gang are quickly disposed of.</string>
  <string id="101668" soundid="156319">Are you mad? Well, it doesn&apos;t matter, you must train one at a time. If you seem to be too strong a target, I&apos;m sure they will accommodate your death wish.</string>
  <string id="101669" soundid="156320">You are in a hurry to make enemies, aren&apos;t you? Very well, Master Shin has a new attendant in his entourage who is supposed to be trained. Attendant Kitan.</string>
  <string id="101670" soundid="156321">She is replacing one of the acolytes who did not return from Tien&apos;s Landing. There was no explanation. I assume he was weak and was discarded.</string>
  <string id="101671" soundid="156322">You can find her and all of the other Attendants by the doors to the inner chambers. They wait there for when Shin leaves to inspect new slave shipments.</string>
  <string id="101673">Very well. Let&apos;s spar.</string>
  <string id="101675">Goodbye.</string>
  <string id="101676">You weren&apos;t much of a trainer. I will be far better.</string>
  <string id="101680">Three more to go and Shin is helpless if called to fight.</string>
  <string id="101682">I&apos;m not ready to spar with you.</string>
  <string id="101690">I apologize for taking your position.</string>
  <string id="101693">I have access to Shin&apos;s personal entourage?</string>
  <string id="101696">Would there be an outcry if one of Shin&apos;s entourage died during training?</string>
  <string id="101698">I want to get rid of all of them. How many can I fight at once?</string>
  <string id="101699">Who am I supposed to train?</string>
  <string id="101703">What training services can you provide?</string>
  <string id="101704">How did you come to join the Assassins?</string>
  <string id="101705">What ability do you mean?</string>
  <string id="101706">You and the others were incapacitated. I did what I could.</string>
  <string id="101710" soundid="175123">Look, I didn&apos;t mean to say.... Anyway, I meant no offense to anyone, and I&apos;ll just leave it at that.</string>

  <string id="101729">Forged Slaver Documents</string>
  <string id="101730">Several pages detailing the actions and transactions of the Slave Traders in the Imperial City. These documents are cleverly doctored to falsely indicate Scholar Songtao&apos;s involvement with the Slave Traders.</string>
  <string id="101732" soundid="156392">Silence! Your lives are nothing. It is Gang&apos;s insolence that is the real insult.</string>
  <string id="101733" soundid="156393">You thought to make me vulnerable by killing my Attendants and emptying the hall? A miscalculation. I am a favored of Grand Inquisitor Jia! You will die!</string>
  <string id="101734" soundid="156394">And where are the rest of my Attendants? Delays and laziness will be repaid in blood! No one disobeys my orders!</string>

  <string id="101748">I can&apos;t believe a little blood could do so much.</string>
  <string id="101750">Enough of this... what&apos;s next?</string>
  <string id="101751">Mechanic Hin Goo has asked you to use your ship, the Marvelous Dragonfly, to help him with his business. The mechanic has upgrades available for your ship, as well.</string>

  <string id="101770">Go to the Necropolis and find Jinlin at the tomb of the old emperor, which is in the north of the Necropolis. </string>

  <string id="101774">Destroy all the spirits and enemies within the tomb.</string>

  <string id="101777">Escape the Tomb</string>
  <string id="101778">Defeat all the enemies and escape the tomb.</string>

  <string id="101797">Decided Not to Give Evidence</string>
  <string id="101800">Prefect Jitong refused to pay as much as you wanted for the evidence. He has decided to find someone else to help him uncover the truth behind the slave traders.</string>
  <string id="101801">Take Evidence to Prefect Jitong</string>
  <string id="101802">You must take the evidence about the slave traders to Prefect Jitong in Merchants&apos; Square in the Market District and get Scholar Songtao released.</string>
  <string id="101804">You discovered that Chandler Ling was indeed behind the slave traders. He will likely be sent to the Wall for his crimes. Scholar Songtao is free.</string>

  <string id="101848">Legend</string>
  <string id="101850" soundid="156521">I bring a message from my Master. You have restored one fountain, but the guardian of its seal was weak. The seal for the second fountain is not so easily claimed!</string>
  <string id="101851" soundid="156522">We shall battle in time, mortal spirit... and I shall feast upon your soul! But this is not the time or place.</string>
  <string id="101852" soundid="156523">I am the Minion of Suffering. It was I who devoured the guardian bound to this fountain and claimed the seal for my Master.</string>
  <string id="101853" soundid="156524">Seek me out, traverse the Path of Demons, and you can reclaim the seal... if you dare!</string>
  <string id="101854" soundid="156525">I agree. The demon would not reveal itself without cause.</string>
  <string id="101855" soundid="156526">Wait. Do not rush off foolishly. The demon could be trying to lure you into a trap. </string>
  <string id="101856" soundid="156527">It must have a lair around here. If we face it there, its strength will be at its greatest, but we have little choice if we are to recover the seal.</string>
  <string id="101857" soundid="156528">But there may be a way to yet overcome this demon. I know of a gem here in the monastery; a gem of great power. You could use it to help defeat this monster.</string>
  <string id="101858" soundid="156529">You alone understand the full extent of your capabilities. But the gem will augment your strength... you would be foolish to ignore it.</string>
  <string id="101859" soundid="156530">The gem has been kept here in the monastery for many generations, guarded by powerful spells that keep evil at bay. The spells persisted even after Dirge fell.</string>
  <string id="101860" soundid="156531">The demon seeks to lure us to its lair, but it may also be trying to lure us away from the gem. We must go through the opposite arch if you wish to claim the gem.</string>
  <string id="101861" soundid="156532">You are the last Spirit Monk; the wards will not keep you from the gem. But take care; its power will be like a beacon, drawing all manner of dark spirits near.</string>
  <string id="101862">Auspicious Portents</string>
  <string id="101863" soundid="156534">Perhaps it is just as well. The power of the gem must glow like a beacon here in Dirge. All manner of foul ghosts and spirits would be drawn to it.</string>
  <string id="101864" soundid="156535">Battling through such creatures may be just as difficult as facing the demon. In any case, the choice is yours.</string>
  <string id="101865" soundid="156536">You cannot join this battle. Your destiny lies in the temple at the top of the stairs!</string>
  <string id="101867">Who are you?</string>
  <string id="101868">Did you destroy this fountain&apos;s guardian?</string>
  <string id="101869">Prepare to die, demon!</string>
  <string id="101872">Well, this is obviously a trap.</string>
  <string id="101873">Quick, let&apos;s go after him!</string>
  <string id="101876">Would the gem still be here after all these years?</string>
  <string id="101877">Where can I find this gem?</string>
  <string id="101878">I don&apos;t need any help to defeat a demon!</string>
  <string id="101881">What about these spells protecting it?</string>
  <string id="101882">
Understanding the stars and the universe is a very important goal. By examining the universe, we can interpret and predict things to come. The sky is where the Great Dragon was said to dwell, and in his illustrious home we can see the signs of his effects on creation.

Of the observable phenomena, three major ones are the most auspicious: comets, the flames of the heavens, passing across the sky; eclipses, during which the power of the gods blocks the sun for brief periods; and falling stars, marking the descent of one of the Celestial Bureaucracy to the earth.</string>
  <string id="101883">Fine. Let&apos;s go get the gem.</string>
  <string id="101885">I can take care of this demon. Nothing can stop me.</string>
  <string id="101892" soundid="156565">He has no name. He is a being from neither the mortal world nor the spirit realm. He is darkness; he is suffering; he is sorrow and despair. He is evil incarnate.</string>
  <string id="101893" soundid="156566">I do not fear you, for the power of my master flows through me. I enforce his will, for all must bow down to him, in time.</string>
  <string id="101895">Who is your master?</string>
  <string id="101896">I will cleanse Dirge of this taint!</string>
  <string id="101897">Give me the seal or I will destroy you.</string>
  <string id="101899" soundid="156572">My minion is destroyed; the second seal is yours. But even that will not avail you.</string>
  <string id="101900" soundid="156573">I have feasted too long to fall to you. Too many souls, too many spirits. The pain and misery of their slaughter sustains me.</string>
  <string id="101901" soundid="156574">For twenty years, I have lingered in the shadows, growing stronger. The corruption of Dirge feeds me. It gives me power.</string>
  <string id="101902" soundid="156575">I am darkness. I am all that is unholy, all that you fear and loathe. I await you in the temple. There, you will understand my true nature and despair.</string>
  <string id="101903" soundid="156576">In all my long years of study... in all my life, I have never heard of a being of such malevolent evil as this.</string>
  <string id="101904" soundid="156577">I knew spirits and demons would overrun Dirge after the Emperor defiled it, but the corruption is far greater than I ever feared... and worse is yet to come!</string>
  <string id="101905" soundid="156578">The temple itself is the center of Dirge&apos;s corruption. The taint is at its strongest there. I shudder to think what unknown evil might await us inside.</string>
  <string id="101906" soundid="156579">The Water Dragon has faith in you, and I see you have faith in yourself. I must believe such faith is justified. In any case, we have found the seal.</string>
  <string id="101907" soundid="156580">We should return to the fountain by the courtyard gates. Restore it with the seal you took from the demon and the gates to the temple courtyard should open.</string>
  <string id="101910">Who are you?</string>
  <string id="101911">I will cleanse Dirge of this evil!</string>
  <string id="101912">I killed your minion, and I can kill you!</string>
  <string id="101916">Whatever it is, I will defeat it!</string>
  <string id="101917">At least we have the seal now.</string>
  <string id="101918">You might be afraid of what&apos;s ahead, but I&apos;m not.</string>
  <string id="101921" soundid="156594">What am I going to do? I&apos;m ruined.</string>
  <string id="101922" soundid="156595">Poor Chang. If only I hadn&apos;t sent him on such a dangerous mission... he&apos;d still be alive.</string>
  <string id="101923" soundid="156596">This can&apos;t be happening. My business is finished... I&apos;m finished.</string>
  <string id="101924" soundid="156597">I can&apos;t sell upgrades if I can&apos;t find supplies. I&apos;m ruined... finished.</string>
  <string id="101925" soundid="156598">For twenty years, I have sought to pass the wards protecting this gem. Its power calls out to me, yet the magic guarding this prize has kept me at bay. None can pass.</string>
  <string id="101926" soundid="156599">You bear the mark of the Water Dragon! You can pass through the wards... as will I, once I have devoured your spirit!</string>
  <string id="101927">The gem is mine by right. I can pass.</string>
  <string id="101928" soundid="156601">I serve my owner without hesitation. I have no taste for the lash.</string>
  <string id="101929" soundid="156602">I should not speak with you. I have no desire to incur my owner&apos;s wrath.</string>
  <string id="101930" soundid="156603">I do what I must. I cannot complain.</string>
  <string id="101931" soundid="156604">I serve as I am directed. I have no other option.</string>
  <string id="101932" soundid="156605">I used to be a free man, but that seems like a long time ago.</string>
  <string id="101933" soundid="156606">My owner is kind enough, but he still calls me &quot;property.&quot; He has my obedience, but nothing else.</string>
  <string id="101935" soundid="156608">I don&apos;t have time to talk to new recruits. Don&apos;t waste my time.</string>
  <string id="101936" soundid="156609">Scum like you crawls out of the gutter every few minutes. Go away, trash.</string>
  <string id="101937" soundid="156610">I suppose having your nose in Master Gang&apos;s backside is one way to get ahead.</string>
  <string id="101938" soundid="156611">If Master Gang hadn&apos;t shown you such favoritism, you wouldn&apos;t have gotten anywhere.</string>
  <string id="101939" soundid="156612">Ha, Shin was wasteful. Without him around, someone more... deserving can move up.</string>
  <string id="101940" soundid="156613">The way is open for my ascension now. Master Shin won&apos;t be able to keep me back anymore.</string>
  <string id="101941" soundid="156614">With all the masters gone, there&apos;s no limits to how far I can rise... or the methods with which I can deal with my opponents.</string>
  <string id="101942" soundid="156615">The masters conspired to keep us in our place, but my place is above them all!</string>
  <string id="101943" soundid="156616">I will easily surpass the petty efforts you&apos;ve put forth. I only need time.</string>
  <string id="101944" soundid="156617">You may have the ear of the masters for now, but soon it will be me they favor.</string>
  <string id="101945" soundid="156618">If the masters favored me like they do you, I would be even higher!</string>
  <string id="101946" soundid="156619">You can&apos;t expect to prove your ability when you&apos;re coddled by the masters all the time.</string>
  <string id="101947" soundid="156620">With the death of Master Shin, there is a lot of room for advancement now.</string>
  <string id="101948" soundid="156621">Someone who can stir things up as well as you is someone to keep an eye on.</string>
  <string id="101949" soundid="156622">There is no limit to how high I can climb with the masters gone. You have served a useful purpose.</string>
  <string id="101950" soundid="156623">I never liked Shin or Gang very much. They always spoke down to me. You did good work in setting this up.</string>
  <string id="101951" soundid="156624">I have been separated to reflect on my devotion.</string>
  <string id="101952" soundid="156625">There is nothing in this life except my service to Death&apos;s Hand.</string>
  <string id="101953" soundid="156626">Those who do not serve are useless trash.</string>
  <string id="101954" soundid="156627">I would give anything to be able to serve.</string>
  <string id="101955" soundid="156628">I am devoted to Death&apos;s Hand alone.</string>
  <string id="101956" soundid="156629">If permitted to serve, I would give my life as a Lotus Assassin.</string>
  <string id="101966" soundid="156639">I have no time for you, acolyte. I focus every thought on the Emperor&apos;s glorious golem army.</string>
  <string id="101967" soundid="156640">You are beneath me. Go, or risk being used as golem fodder.</string>
  <string id="101968" soundid="156641">You have proven to be more than I thought. Shin was no fool.</string>
  <string id="101969" soundid="156642">Did luck lead you to defeat Shin? New recruits are rarely so able to manipulate the masters.</string>
  <string id="101970" soundid="156643">You have proven yourself a cunning individual. That must be nurtured... or destroyed.</string>
  <string id="101971" soundid="156644">Gang and Shin let their ambition cloud their minds. It will not happen to me.</string>
  <string id="101972" soundid="156645">Keep bothering me and you won&apos;t survive being an acolyte. Your spirit could power a golem as well as any slave.</string>
  <string id="101973" soundid="156646">Lotus Assassins are far superior to you acolytes. We are trusted followers of the will of the Emperor, and will lead his golem army.</string>
  <string id="101974" soundid="156647">Shin&apos;s death has forced me to notice you. You just might survive to truly serve.</string>
  <string id="101975" soundid="156648">To be a Lotus Assassin is to serve Death&apos;s Hand. Shin has proven unworthy, as have many before him.</string>
  <string id="101976" soundid="156649">Shin and Gang were both idiots. The talent you have shown should not be wasted on such petty machinations.</string>
  <string id="101977" soundid="156650">The promise you hold should not be wasted. No matter the rank we claim, we are still under Death&apos;s Hand.</string>
  <string id="101978" soundid="156651">Return to your duties, acolyte. If you are not working to increase the Emperor&apos;s glorious golem army, you are a waste of our resources.</string>
  <string id="101979" soundid="156652">If you survive your training, then you can speak to me. Idle chatter will not delay production of the golems.</string>
  <string id="101980" soundid="156653">You seem more clever than I first thought. Of course, Shin was a fool.</string>
  <string id="101981" soundid="156654">I&apos;ll be watching you from now on. You&apos;ve shown promise.</string>
  <string id="101982" soundid="156655">New acolytes rarely impress me. You&apos;ll be one to watch in the future.</string>
  <string id="101983" soundid="156656">Your have great promise, but not all of us are as easily distracted as Gang and Shin.</string>
  <string id="101984">Speak With Lady Rento</string>
  <string id="101985">Lady Rento said she would be in the Imperial Arena if anyone needed to question her about Creative Yukong.</string>
  <string id="101987">You spoke with Lady Rento and learned that Yukong isn&apos;t actually much of a confidence man. He asked her to sponsor him as an actor. She suggested that he might be hiding in the Scholars&apos; Garden.</string>
  <string id="101988">Track Down Creative Yukong</string>
  <string id="101989">Creative Yukong could be disguised as anyone in the city, but he might give himself away by seeming out of place.</string>
  <string id="101991">You found the somewhat miserable Yukong posing as a scholar in the Scholars&apos; Garden. All that remains is deciding what to do with him.</string>
  <string id="101992">Track Down Creative Yukong</string>
  <string id="101993">According to Lady Rento, Creative Yukong is likely to be hiding in the Scholars&apos; Garden.</string>
  <string id="101995">You found the somewhat miserable Yukong posing as a scholar in the Scholars&apos; Garden. All that remains is deciding what to do with him.</string>
  <string id="101996">Eliminate Yukong</string>
  <string id="101997">Creative Yukong has a bounty on his head. Eliminating him would enable you to collect that silver.</string>
  <string id="101999">You tracked Creative Yukong down to the Scholars&apos; Garden and eliminated him, satisfying the conditions of the bounty.</string>
  <string id="102000">Aid Yukong&apos;s Escape</string>
  <string id="102001">Yukong seems a bit hapless and only wants to leave the city. There may be some way to help him.</string>
  <string id="102003">You agreed to help Creative Yukong out of the city instead of collecting his bounty. Now you just have to get him past Captain Sen.</string>
  <string id="102004">Collect Yukong&apos;s Bounty</string>
  <string id="102005">Captain Sen will be glad to hear that you have dealt with Creative Yukong. Your reward waits near the gates in the Market District.</string>
  <string id="102007">Captain Sen rewarded you for eliminating the notorious confidence man, Creative Yukong.</string>
  <string id="102008">Allow Yukong to Escape</string>
  <string id="102011">After several false starts, Creative Yukong finally managed to make his way out of the city. He should be safe now that he is away from the wrath of Lord Rento.</string>
  <string id="102012">Turn In Creative Yukong</string>
  <string id="102015">You turned in Creative Yukong after Captain Sen offered to up his bounty for more information. The bounty collected, your task is complete.</string>
  <string id="102128" soundid="158650">I doubt there are two people in the Empire that know *how* they work. It&apos;s a baffling combination of magic and artifice.</string>

  <string id="102450">The original script for your scene as Lady Fourteen Flowers. In this version of the play, your character explains that the end of the Jade Empire&apos;s expansion occurred because Sagacious Tien listened to the will of the heavens. The theme of the heavens reaching out to the Emperor is explored at least twice, and it contains the historically accepted truth that the northern border of the Jade Empire was traced by a shooting star. There will likely be a book and scroll stand near the stage where you can study your part in more detail.</string>

  <string id="103063">More wine coming!</string>
  <string id="103064">Get the wine!</string>
  <string id="103065">Get away from me you beast!</string>
  <string id="103066">Help! Help me!</string>
  <string id="103067">Ahh! Help me!</string>
  <string id="103068">Just keep them off me.</string>
  <string id="103069">Aha! Take that!</string>
  <string id="103070">Die, die, die!</string>
  <string id="103071">Ow!, my hand!</string>
  <string id="103072">Ahh! Much better.</string>
  <string id="103073">Something... inside me!</string>
  <string id="103074">Take that you brute!</string>
  <string id="103075">Ha, ha! Not so easy is it.</string>
  <string id="103076">This is about as much fun as watching yeast rise. Let&apos;s go!</string>
  <string id="103077">Baking buns is boring work, but it&apos;s more fun than this.</string>
  <string id="103078">Perhaps we should get moving again, before my legs cramp up.</string>
  <string id="103079">I need healing!</string>
  <string id="103080">No effect? I&apos;ll come back bigger!</string>
  <string id="103081">Welts for everyone!</string>
  <string id="103082">I&apos;ll brain you with a wrench!</string>
  <string id="103083">Spanner style! To the bolts!</string>
  <string id="103084">I&apos;ll twist your locknuts!</string>
  <string id="103085">Pieces to bits!</string>
  <string id="103086">Incoming!</string>
  <string id="103087">Cover your ears. Friendly warning.</string>
  <string id="103088">I leave craters!</string>
  <string id="103091">Ah, the stiches are tight and ready to go.</string>
  <string id="103092">A dirty fight... poison in the wound.</string>
  <string id="103093">A hit so hard your ancestors foretold it!</string>
  <string id="103094">Haha! I am elusive!</string>
  <string id="103095">Get going or I&apos;ll build you a reason to run.</string>
  <string id="103096">Idle hands can&apos;t get the ox in the catapult, as they say.</string>
  <string id="103097">How about I build some machines to stand around waiting, so we can actually go do something?</string>
  <string id="103098">My blood is improvising.</string>
  <string id="103099">Grrr! My attacks do nothing.</string>
  <string id="103100">You will be fun.</string>
  <string id="103101">You are no match for me!</string>
  <string id="103102">I cannot lose.</string>
  <string id="103103">Your life ends here!</string>
  <string id="103104">Fall before me!</string>
  <string id="103105">You will kneel!</string>
  <string id="103106">For the good of the Empire!</string>
  <string id="103107">You are a disgrace!</string>
  <string id="103108">I will enjoy this.</string>
  <string id="103109">First you will suffer.</string>
  <string id="103110">I am restored.</string>
  <string id="103111">I am sickened. Poison.</string>
  <string id="103112">Did that hurt? Good.</string>
  <string id="103113">Your attacks are nothing.</string>
  <string id="103114">This waiting grows tedious.</string>
  <string id="103115">It is foolish to sit and wait for an enemy to find us.</string>
  <string id="103116">I grow bored.</string>
  <string id="103117">I need my wounds treated.</string>
  <string id="103118">I didn&apos;t hurt you?</string>
  <string id="103119">Now you fall!</string>
  <string id="103120">That&apos;s all you&apos;ve got?</string>
  <string id="103121">Too slow!</string>
  <string id="103122">Enough of this!</string>
  <string id="103123">I&apos;ll bring you down!</string>
  <string id="103124">Say goodbye!</string>
  <string id="103125">You have to be stopped.</string>
  <string id="103126">This ends here.</string>
  <string id="103127">Taste my blades!</string>
  <string id="103128">Vengeance!</string>
  <string id="103129">That&apos;s more like it.</string>
  <string id="103130">That stings!</string>
  <string id="103131">You&apos;ll feel *that*!</string>
  <string id="103132">Tough luck!</string>
  <string id="103133">Shouldn&apos;t we do something?</string>
  <string id="103134">They say time flies on silver wings.</string>
  <string id="103135">If we&apos;re going to be here long, should I get my dice?</string>
  <string id="103136">I don&apos;t know how much more I can take....</string>
  <string id="103148">Th... thank you. I feel better now.</string>
  <string id="103149">My body... doesn&apos;t feel so good.</string>
  <string id="103152">The Guardian says we shouldn&apos;t stand around so much.</string>
  <string id="103153">Don&apos;t we have something to do?</string>
  <string id="103154">Ooo! Pretty!</string>
  <string id="103155">I&apos;m... I&apos;m hurting...</string>
  <string id="103156">Oh? You resist my blow?</string>
  <string id="103157">Tremble in fear!</string>
  <string id="103158">You&apos;re meat!</string>
  <string id="103159">Come to my darkness.</string>
  <string id="103160">Come, power!</string>
  <string id="103161">Such a pathetic existence.</string>
  <string id="103162">Your life ends!</string>
  <string id="103165">Cower in fear!</string>
  <string id="103166">I cherish your pain!</string>
  <string id="103167">My flesh regenerates!</string>
  <string id="103168">Ah, you have infected my body.</string>
  <string id="103169">Rend you limb from limb!</string>
  <string id="103170">It is foolish to resist!</string>
  <string id="103171">Why must we wait needlessly?</string>
  <string id="103172">Standing around is not the path to power...</string>
  <string id="103173">Scream for me, little girl. *Wild Flower screams*</string>
  <string id="103174">I am... being beaten?! I cannot!</string>
  <string id="103175">I cannot harm this one.</string>
  <string id="103176">This was your last mistake.</string>
  <string id="103177">This is my fate.</string>
  <string id="103178">This ends!</string>
  <string id="103179">You fall!</string>
  <string id="103180">It has come to this!</string>
  <string id="103181">No more!</string>
  <string id="103182">Flee or suffer!</string>
  <string id="103183">You know nothing.</string>

  <string id="103188">*This* is how it ends!</string>
  <string id="103189">You can&apos;t hurt me like that!</string>
  <string id="103190">A wise man does not wait for his fate.</string>
  <string id="103191">Seize what time you have. Act.</string>
  <string id="103192">Should we be delaying here?</string>
  <string id="103193">I can&apos;t help much longer.</string>

  <string id="103220" soundid="158149">That&apos;s it! I&apos;m through wasting pleasantries with you! Now get out and leave me alone!</string>
  <string id="103221" soundid="158652">So you don&apos;t really know.</string>
  <string id="103222" soundid="158653">If you actually cared about the safety of this machine, you wouldn&apos;t be about to fly it into a swarm of enemies. What guarantee do you want?</string>
  <string id="103223" soundid="158654">There is a handle attached to something like the reins of an ox yoke. You move it left and right, forward and back. It should swim through the air fairly smoothly.</string>
  <string id="103224" soundid="158655">Will you come to help us, Zu? You seem to have a good heart.</string>
  <string id="103225" soundid="158656">If... you are intent on returning, I will accompany you. I have already done more than I wanted, but I could not avoid this forever.</string>
  <string id="103226" soundid="158657">You are an interesting person, Sagacious Zu. Your eyes hold a great sadness that is oddly familiar to me, but I don&apos;t know why.</string>
  <string id="103227" soundid="158658">Perhaps I am imagining it. We will discuss it another time. I hope we are not too late.</string>
  <string id="103228" soundid="158659"></string>
  <string id="103229" soundid="158660"></string>
  <string id="103230" soundid="158661">Agreed. There are greater things to worry about. I hope we are not too late.</string>
  <string id="103231" soundid="158662">I&apos;ve seen this kind of attack before. The tools used are different, but it&apos;s the same kind of destruction.</string>
  <string id="103232" soundid="158663">I guess so. I heard Gao ordering them to kill anyone who approached. It&apos;s too bad so many people had to suffer for this.</string>
  <string id="103233" soundid="158664">You&apos;re weren&apos;t always so cold. I guess it helped you here. I heard Gao tell his men to attack anyone who approached.</string>
  <string id="103234" soundid="158665">Thank you for coming to my rescue. I&apos;m not sure why Gao thought he would get away with this.</string>
  <string id="103235" soundid="158666">He had to know that someone in the village would come for me... although I suspected it would be you.</string>
  <string id="103236" soundid="158667">I am grateful. Your friendship has always been a comfort to me. Maybe that was what made Gao so jealous? I don&apos;t know.</string>
  <string id="103237" soundid="158668">There you are. I thought you might need some help with Gao, but it appears I was wrong.</string>
  <string id="103238" soundid="158669">And who is this? I must thank your new acquaintance for his help as well.</string>
  <string id="103239" soundid="158670">Sagacious Zu. You don&apos;t owe me anything. I just helped your young friend through the swamp.</string>
  <string id="103240" soundid="158671">Sagacious Zu... Well, I am grateful. I don&apos;t know what Gao meant by saying he was doing me a favor. How could dragging me here be beneficial?</string>
  <string id="103241" soundid="158199">And don&apos;t you let that Merchant Fen Do talk you into the cheap stuff! He might make a few extra silvers, but your friend&apos;s health isn&apos;t worth his profit margins.</string>
  <string id="103243" soundid="158672">He earned his fate, I guess, but I wonder what led him to that. Master Li tried so hard to reach him.</string>
  <string id="103244" soundid="158673">Gao just seemed to get more and more bitter. He didn&apos;t respond well to discipline. It&apos;s too bad.</string>
  <string id="103245" soundid="158674">Yes, I want to get back to Two Rivers as soon as possible.</string>
  <string id="103246" soundid="158675">Don&apos;t be long. I don&apos;t want to stay here a moment longer than I have to.</string>
  <string id="103247" soundid="158676">I will wait by Gao&apos;s flyer. He can&apos;t object now.</string>
  <string id="103248" soundid="158677">Agreed. I want Master Li to know that we are both safe. It&apos;s too bad, though; he wanted to reach Gao. I&apos;m sure of it.</string>
  <string id="103249" soundid="158678">That&apos;s very cold of you, but I suppose he deserved what he got. It&apos;s sad, really. Master Li tried so hard to reach him.</string>
  <string id="103250" soundid="158679">Well, I am grateful I have you as a friend. I&apos;ve always respected your strength. I&apos;m surprised Gao didn&apos;t have an interest in you, instead of me.</string>
  <string id="103251" soundid="158680">Not that I&apos;d wish that on you. He was such a fool.</string>
  <string id="103252" soundid="158681">Oh. Well, your loyalty to... us is very welcome. You wouldn&apos;t want this mess with Gao to disrupt our lessons.</string>
  <string id="103253" soundid="158682">Is that what this was? I&apos;m sorry for inconveniencing you. I&apos;ll make sure someone else is available the next time I get kidnapped.</string>
  <string id="103254" soundid="158683">There you are. I thought you might need assistance, but it seems you are done.</string>
  <string id="103255" soundid="158684">Does this friend of yours share your lack of concern? Perhaps this is a chore for him, as well?</string>
  <string id="103256" soundid="158685">I am Sagacious Zu. I am glad to see you are well.</string>
  <string id="103257" soundid="158686">Sagacious Zu... well, I am grateful to *you,* at least. I have no idea why Gao felt dragging me through the swamp would be beneficial.</string>
  <string id="103258" soundid="158687"></string>
  <string id="103259" soundid="158688"></string>
  <string id="103260" soundid="158689">No... this can&apos;t be.</string>
  <string id="103261" soundid="158690">It is what I expected. I am sorry you had to see this.</string>
  <string id="103262" soundid="158691">I saw the smoke from the air, but I didn&apos;t think... didn&apos;t think it would be so bad. Everyone... everyone is gone.</string>
  <string id="103263">[TEMP] generic_training_body_1</string>
  <string id="103265" soundid="158693">I hope you are right. Master Li wouldn&apos;t let this happen. Not without a fight.</string>
  <string id="103266" soundid="158694">Do what you can together. We will meet in the heart of your school.</string>
  <string id="103267" soundid="158695">Guide Zu to the heart of the school. We will meet there.</string>

  <string id="103269" soundid="158697">Look around! What are we doing here if we can&apos;t save anyone? We have to find Master Li. He wouldn&apos;t let this happen. Not without a fight.</string>
  <string id="103270">This wrinkled sheet of paper is filled with diagrams doodled in the corners and along the margins. The majority of the page, however, is taken up by the following text: 

&quot;The dual eyes of fire can fuel greatness, but only if all save the conductor work together with the dragon.&quot; 

There seems to be little else of interest on the page, except for a doodled picture of a dolphin with some sort of contraption attached to its head and a note underneath that reads, &quot;No! Sharks!&quot;</string>

  <string id="103296" soundid="158724">I don&apos;t know why they were so intent on taking your Master Li, but they never attack without purpose.</string>
  <string id="103297" soundid="158725">That&apos;s... not possible. Sun Li the Glorious Strategist was the Emperor&apos;s brother and the head of the Imperial Army. Your Master Li cannot be him.</string>
  <string id="103298" soundid="158726">Why not?</string>
  <string id="103299" soundid="158727">Because he can&apos;t! Sun Li was declared a traitor to the Empire twenty years ago. The Emperor himself accused him of killing the third brother, Prince Kin.</string>
  <string id="103300" soundid="158728">And besides, the Glorious Strategist would not have made such mistakes.</string>
  <string id="103301" soundid="158729">What mistakes?</string>

  <string id="103303" soundid="158731">The Glorious Strategist would know his enemy, and if anything is true about Lotus Assassins, it&apos;s that they don&apos;t leave survivors. I should know.</string>

  <string id="103305" soundid="158733">If you will not be dissuaded, we should go to the Imperial City in the Mosquito flyer. Gao the Greater has... powerful contacts. You may find a path to him there.</string>

  <string id="103312" soundid="158740">Gao the Greater was behind this attack, but I suspect there is someone else behind him. You will find your answers in the Imperial City.</string>

  <string id="103315" soundid="158743">Let&apos;s go. I don&apos;t... I don&apos;t want to be here. I want to go where I can actually make a difference.</string>
  <string id="103316" soundid="158744">That is... a very common desire. The hardest to achieve, but very common. Come, let&apos;s see if we can get Gao the Lesser&apos;s contraption in the air again.</string>
  <string id="103317" soundid="158745">It won&apos;t be stable enough to get to the Imperial City, but we might reach the trading village of Tien&apos;s Landing. All trade routes lead to the heart of the Empire.</string>

  <string id="103327" soundid="158755">I know enough about the Glorious Strategist to say he wouldn&apos;t make that mistake. And I know... far too much about the Lotus Assassins.</string>
  <string id="103328" soundid="158756">Gao raved about a lot of things, like hearing Master Li tell you that he was the Glorious Strategist. What does it mean?</string>
  <string id="103329" soundid="158757">I don&apos;t know if this is about you. What did Gao say... that he had overheard Master Li tell you he was the Glorious Strategist? What does that mean?</string>
  <string id="103330" soundid="158758">Perhaps Gao the Greater is taking advantage of some larger action. The Lotus Assassins answer to Death&apos;s Hand alone. He would not appear unless this was important.</string>
  <string id="103331" soundid="158759">A lieutenant, perhaps? Death&apos;s Hand leads all others. He would not appear unless this was important. He usually acts behind the scenes.</string>

  <string id="103335">This will cause all of your enemies to slow down time for a brief period. The Chi cost for Reverse Tides is moderate.</string>
  <string id="103336">This advanced shield will not only protect your ship, but it will cause significant damage to any enemies unfortunate enough to collide with it. The Chi cost for Spirit&apos;s Calling is high.</string>
  <string id="103337" soundid="158765"></string>
  <string id="103338" soundid="158766">That was quite the crash! I wouldn&apos;t have left the marsh had I known we were headed for such a spectacular landing.</string>
  <string id="103339" soundid="158767">It&apos;s a miracle we all survived unharmed. Uh... we did all survive, didn&apos;t we?</string>
  <string id="103340" soundid="158768">I&apos;m okay, too. A little shaken up, is all.</string>
  <string id="103341" soundid="158769">We were lucky. Only a fool braves the air currents without a proper wind map. You can&apos;t navigate the skies without them. Not safely, anyway.</string>
  <string id="103342" soundid="158770">We weren&apos;t traveling far. I thought we could reach Tien&apos;s Landing safely without one. Obviously I was wrong.</string>
  <string id="103343" soundid="158771">So where are we going to find a wind map of this region? We can&apos;t follow Master Li&apos;s captors without one.</string>
  <string id="103344" soundid="158772">Things are even worse than that. Look at our flyer. Even if we had a wind map, this thing wouldn&apos;t take to the air again.</string>
  <string id="103345" soundid="158773">Ha! You make it sound so simple. Flyers and wind maps are rare things, even in the Imperial City. Out here they&apos;re all but unknown.</string>
  <string id="103346" soundid="158774">Not to further darken your mood, but flyers and wind maps are rare even in the Imperial City. Out here, they&apos;re all but unknown.</string>
  <string id="103347" soundid="158775">Gao and his pirates used flyers to attack Two Rivers, and the Lotus Assassins who took Master Li had them, too. Somebody around here must know something about them!</string>
  <string id="103348" soundid="158776">I&apos;m... I&apos;m sorry to get upset, but every second we&apos;re stuck here, Master Li gets farther away from us.</string>
  <string id="103349" soundid="158777">We&apos;re near Tien&apos;s Landing. It&apos;s a small village, but maybe someone there knows where we can find a new flyer. If nothing else, I remember a clearing suitable for a camp.</string>
  <string id="103350" soundid="158778">And if we can&apos;t find a flyer, we can always follow on foot. To the south of the village is a forest. A trade route leads through it to the Imperial City.</string>
  <string id="103351" soundid="158779">The village is across the bridge and beyond a large marker stone. Look for the giant rock with a painting of a fish on it, and you&apos;ll know you&apos;re heading in the right direction.</string>
  <string id="103352" soundid="158780">Very well, although I do not like the thought of remaining here for long. I sense something. This place... is tainted. Something bad happened here.</string>
  <string id="103353" soundid="158781">Yes, we crashed our flyer and almost died!</string>
  <string id="103354" soundid="158782">No, it&apos;s something else. I&apos;m... I&apos;m sure it&apos;s nothing. Hurry, there has to be a safer place for us to camp than this.</string>
  <string id="103355" soundid="158783">Very well. I&apos;ll wait here for now. It&apos;s not so different from the marsh, actually. More of an impending sense of doom, but that could just be your influence.</string>
  <string id="103356" soundid="158784">We should get going. There has to be a better place for us to rest than this. Let&apos;s go.</string>
  <string id="103357" soundid="158785">Hopeless is a grim word. I wouldn&apos;t say things are hopeless. Not completely.</string>
  <string id="103358" soundid="158786">The people of Tien&apos;s Landing owe you a great debt. You saved their town... Master Li would be proud of you, as am I.</string>
  <string id="103359" soundid="158787">Now we have everything we need to follow Master Li&apos;s captors to the Imperial City. I am eager to do so, after all the resistance we have encountered.</string>
  <string id="103361" soundid="158789">If you could spare some time, could we talk about what we have seen?</string>
  <string id="103362" soundid="158790">I have concerns as well. Hui convinced me that your master is the Glorious Strategist. Tell me, Dawn Star, what are your earliest memories with him?</string>
  <string id="103363" soundid="158791">You would be better served by asking his favored student. He was at the school three years before I was.</string>
  <string id="103364" soundid="158792">We&apos;ll focus on you quite a bit by the time we are done, given the Spirit Monk connection, but I asked Dawn Star what *she* remembers.</string>
  <string id="103365" soundid="158793">The only thing I know about my life before coming to the school is that I was not wanted. Probably because of the bad omens I was born under.</string>
  <string id="103366" soundid="158794">Bad omens? What makes you think that? You said you don&apos;t know anything.</string>
  <string id="103367" soundid="158795">I know because of my name. It&apos;s one of the few details Master Li was told. I was named for a red glow opposite the morning sun. Like a distant... a distant fire.</string>
  <string id="103368" soundid="158796">Yes... I guess so. I wasn&apos;t there, of course. No one but you survived. I guess someone saw it, but I don&apos;t know where Dirge is or how far the fire was visible.</string>
  <string id="103369" soundid="158797">No, no one besides you has a claim to surviving the Dirge attack. Don&apos;t worry, you are safe on your pedestal.</string>
  <string id="103370" soundid="158798">It fits the time, but that just confirms my thoughts about being born under a bad omen. What could be worse than this attack on Dirge and the Water Dragon?</string>
  <string id="103371" soundid="158799">If that is the most troubling thing you learn about your birth, consider yourself lucky.</string>
  <string id="103372" soundid="158800">I am merely trying to make sense of the jumble you have made of my world. I meant nothing and certainly didn&apos;t mean to upset Dawn Star.</string>
  <string id="103373" soundid="158801">Forget I said anything. I shouldn&apos;t have interrupted; you were talking to Dawn Star, not me. I&apos;ll let you two get back to your conversation.</string>
  <string id="103374" soundid="158802">Your question would be better directed at his favored student. She was at the school for three years before I arrived.</string>
  <string id="103376" soundid="158804">I am glad to be out of the ruins. There is so much death there... so much unrest. I worry for Master Li after seeing what people are capable of.</string>
  <string id="103377" soundid="158805">The forest was a disturbing place. Such destruction; it was horrible, even if it was mostly unseen.</string>
  <string id="103378" soundid="158806"></string>
  <string id="103379" soundid="158807">This new flyer seems nicer than the one we took from Gao the Lesser, although I&apos;m really only judging by how shiny it is. A poor guess, I&apos;m sure.</string>
  <string id="103380" soundid="158808">No, no, the Marvelous Dragonfly is superior to the Amber Mosquitoes I foisted on Gao. And, actually, the shinier the better. The heavens like their glory reflected.</string>
  <string id="103382" soundid="158810">A shame I can&apos;t leave it on the ground for all to see, but I&apos;m not going through all this just to have it stripped to the frame by local brats. I&apos;ll call it back if we need it.</string>
  <string id="103383" soundid="158811">Well, it&apos;s much like the dilemma of the centipede. If he relaxes and lets things happen, he can walk naturally all day long, his hundred legs not missing a step.</string>
  <string id="103384" soundid="158812">But, if he thinks too hard about the complexity of what he&apos;s doing, those legs might crash into the teahouse and kill everyone. A valuable lesson.</string>
  <string id="103385" soundid="158813">I will return it whenever you wish to make use of it, don&apos;t worry. It is just simpler to have it out of the way when not in use.</string>
  <string id="103386" soundid="196473"></string>
  <string id="103387" soundid="158815">Our new companion is... strange. I sense the power of the demon inside the little girl, but I also sense nobility and honor. I&apos;m glad they travel with us now.</string>
  <string id="103388" soundid="158816">Well, this has already become an educational trip. From what you discussed with Hui, it would seem we are indeed tied to important events.</string>
  <string id="103389" soundid="158817">You should get going to Tien&apos;s Landing. Zu said it was through a bridge and to the south.</string>
  <string id="103390" soundid="158818">Is there anything you need? I&apos;ll do whatever I can to help.</string>
  <string id="103391" soundid="158819">I&apos;m just as anxious as you to rescue Master Li.</string>
  <string id="103392" soundid="158820">I will answer what I can.</string>
  <string id="103393" soundid="158821">I&apos;m not sure I can make my concerns fully understood. Our time in the ruins, the creatures we encountered... so much unrest.</string>
  <string id="103394" soundid="158822">This was different from what I have seen before. There is pain here, but hatred, too. The spirits around Two Rivers seemed aimless... lost. These are focused.</string>
  <string id="103395" soundid="158823">I feel they would linger here, even without the support of whatever has increased the ghosts elsewhere.</string>
  <string id="103396" soundid="158824">I suppose that is true. Left behind by their neighbors, literally to die. Could you recover from such abandonment? I&apos;m not sure that I have.</string>
  <string id="103397" soundid="158825">I mean... if I had suffered something like that, I&apos;m sure it would have stayed with me.</string>
  <string id="103398" soundid="158826">I should not feel bad about it. I was not left to die. I was sent to study at the school. Probably so Master Li could deal with my... sensitivities.</string>
  <string id="103399" soundid="158827">It doesn&apos;t compare, really. These spirits; they truly suffered and have a right to turn on those who left them behind.</string>
  <string id="103400" soundid="158828">Me, I feel like my abandonment was partially my fault, but I was three, and I couldn&apos;t help being different. I would have tried to fit in, if I had been given a chance.</string>
  <string id="103401" soundid="158829">I know I shouldn&apos;t. I can see the result of such pain in the poor creatures in the ruins. I do not want to suffer such anger... such bitterness.</string>
  <string id="103402" soundid="158830">It may not seem like it, but I draw great strength from you and the things you say. I am grateful for that.</string>
  <string id="103403" soundid="158831">That is... an interesting opinion. I thought I was strong for not resorting to that kind of hate, but now I am not so sure.</string>
  <string id="103404" soundid="158832">Are you saying that it was acceptable to leave people there to die? That they just lack the ability to comprehend the necessity of it?</string>
  <string id="103405" soundid="158833">I&apos;m not sure I can support that position. No one deserves to be abandoned. I have... personal experience with that feeling.</string>
  <string id="103406" soundid="158834">Is that all you see? Just white or black, friend or foe? If we cannot understand what motivates our foes, how can we hope to bring the fight to an end?</string>
  <string id="103407" soundid="158835">Problems left in place will just produce more enemies. When does it end?</string>
  <string id="103408" soundid="158836">The anger I sense comes from understandable sources. Left behind to die by their neighbors... could you recover from such abandonment? I&apos;m not sure that I have.</string>
  <string id="103409" soundid="158837">Is this how you maintain yourself amidst the pressures of your life? By dismissing them? I suppose that is one way to view your role in the world.</string>
  <string id="103410" soundid="158838">I thought you took your responsibilities more to heart, but I suppose I sometimes dwell on things too much. I guess there is another side to everything.</string>
  <string id="103411" soundid="158839">As always, I have much to think about after speaking with you. Perhaps we can continue this another time.</string>
  <string id="103412" soundid="158840">Our time in the forest was very troubling to me. To see such distance between the concerns of men and spirits... is something I am still getting used to.</string>
  <string id="103413" soundid="158841">I have been sensitive to these things for as long as I can remember, but it was not always such a disturbing talent. There used to be harmony.</string>
  <string id="103414" soundid="158842">It was very gradual. The world just seems to be filling up with spirits that have no place to go. That this affected even the Forest Shadow is very disturbing.</string>
  <string id="103415" soundid="158843">It makes me wonder how deep the trouble goes, and what mortals like us are supposed to do about it.</string>
  <string id="103416" soundid="158844">What do *you* think? Master Li thought you were tied to this somehow. Can you comfort me?</string>
  <string id="103417" soundid="158845">Your appreciation is just what I was looking for, and I am grateful. I know we will do what we can, even if the world moves in ways we cannot fathom.</string>
  <string id="103418" soundid="158846">I am glad that we can talk like this. It soothes my mind. I hope we can continue another time.</string>
  <string id="103419" soundid="158847">I suppose that someone in your position has little choice in that regard. Everyone needs something from you; one more person just adds to the burden.</string>
  <string id="103420" soundid="158848">Perhaps I have been looking at things the wrong way. It seems I should be more secure in myself before I reach out to others.</string>
  <string id="103421" soundid="158849">Thank you for your time. It was not the answer I expected, but I see the use of it. Perhaps we will continue this later.</string>
  <string id="103422" soundid="158850">What do you mean? It isn&apos;t arrogance; it is the natural order of things. Isn&apos;t it?</string>
  <string id="103423" soundid="158851">I... I sometimes wonder if I was left at the school because my abilities offended the order of things, but, in the end, I found my true place with Master Li.</string>
  <string id="103424" soundid="158852">Now that he has been taken, I fear that we will never find our way back to that simple life. Worse, I worry we were never meant to have it.</string>
  <string id="103425" soundid="158853">I am trying to feel good about what happened at Gao&apos;s fortress, the lair of his pirates.</string>
  <string id="103426" soundid="158854">We went looking for our Master and perhaps another flyer. What we found... I was not prepared for how cruel people could be.</string>
  <string id="103427" soundid="158855">Seeing those people with no control over their fates... it is similar to a pain in my past that I have not thought about for a long time.</string>
  <string id="103428" soundid="158856">I would not dream of saying my experience is similar to those poor people in Gao&apos;s fortress, but that lack of control... I know that well.</string>
  <string id="103429" soundid="158857">One of the only things I know about myself is that on the morning I was born the sky was red, like distant mountains were on fire. Perhaps it was Dirge burning, as Zu said.</string>
  <string id="103430" soundid="158858">I believe it was an ill omen, and that stigma is why my abilities became a burden. That&apos;s why I must have been left at the school.</string>
  <string id="103431" soundid="158859">To be subject to the whims of someone else just because of what you are, be you slave or outsider... yes, I know that well.</string>
  <string id="103432" soundid="158860">Yes, you are an outsider too, albeit one with power to change your world. I think the slaves in the pirate lair would greatly appreciate your skill in defense.</string>
  <string id="103433" soundid="158861">And I would make great use of your confidence. You inspire me to think of the possibilities, not just the problems.</string>
  <string id="103434" soundid="158862">I&apos;m gaining an appreciation for the person you are becoming. Perhaps we should speak on these matters again some time.</string>
  <string id="103435" soundid="158863">I already said I am not drawing a direct comparison. I know full well that there is a difference between being shunned and being imprisoned.</string>
  <string id="103436" soundid="158864">However, they can take cold comfort in being able to see the bars holding them. No one was pretending they are anything but slaves.</string>
  <string id="103437" soundid="158865">When people find out about my abilities, I make them uncomfortable, but no one says it aloud. The walls that keep me out are unseen, but they are there.</string>
  <string id="103438" soundid="158866">Are people to be blamed for the pain that others cause them? What if they had no ability to affect their lot in life?</string>
  <string id="103439" soundid="158867">I was born under an ominous sign. When I started... seeing things, it must have confirmed the superstitions people had formed about me.</string>
  <string id="103440" soundid="158868">Was I &quot;weak?&quot; Was my eventual shunning my own fault? Were these slaves at fault because someone else locked them away?</string>
  <string id="103441" soundid="158869">You suggest that the only reason I feel bad is that I allow it. It is not the worst idea I have ever heard, but your approach is very... indelicate.</string>
  <string id="103442" soundid="158870">Perhaps I was expecting sage counsel such as Master Li might give, but he is not here, and we are both discovering what sort of master you will be.</string>
  <string id="103443" soundid="158871">S-so you claim that I give them more strength than they ever had by dwelling on the past? A simple answer... too simple.</string>
  <string id="103444" soundid="158872">It is worth considering, but there is no epiphany. I already know I shouldn&apos;t let old wounds bother me. Master Li said as much.</string>
  <string id="103445" soundid="158873">Still, you have given me insight into what I must do to survive our current trials. You also reveal how cold you are.</string>
  <string id="103446" soundid="158874">Perhaps we will talk again. You have changed from the child I thought I knew.</string>
  <string id="103447" soundid="158875">You are infuriating! Do you claim that I could not possibly know a similar pain unless I too was made a slave?</string>
  <string id="103448" soundid="158876">You&apos;d better hope not, or you won&apos;t be able to fathom what is wrong with the restless spirits until you are dead yourself!</string>
  <string id="103449" soundid="158877">I am through speaking for now. I&apos;m sorry I brought it up.</string>
  <string id="103450" soundid="158878">If you have no interest in me or my feelings, you have only to say so. I will not bother you further, if that is your wish.</string>
  <string id="103451" soundid="158879">Seeing those people enslaved in the pirate lair has brought unexpected memories. I don&apos;t claim to have suffered as they have, but some things are similar.</string>
  <string id="103452" soundid="158880">Do you have time now? I wanted to speak with you quite a while ago, but you have only now come around.</string>
  <string id="103453" soundid="158881">I feel as though I am bothering you with my feelings. All you have to do is say the word, and I will no longer burden you with my thoughts.</string>
  <string id="103454" soundid="158882">[Success] I know, and I am sorry to stress you further. I will try to be more gentle in my concerns.</string>
  <string id="103455" soundid="158883">I just wanted to talk about what we have seen. You are all that I have left, and as a friend, I value your perception.</string>
  <string id="103456" soundid="158884">[Failure] Your words are hollow. Perhaps you are concerned about other things. I can see my thoughts only distract you.</string>
  <string id="103457" soundid="158885">I will not bother you again unless it is of the utmost importance. I don&apos;t want to impede our rescue of Master Li.</string>
  <string id="103458" soundid="158886">[Success] Thank you. I am sorry to distract you so, but much of what is happening is confusing to me as well.</string>
  <string id="103459" soundid="158887">[Success] I am sorry. I did not mean to add to the stress of an already troubling situation.</string>
  <string id="103460" soundid="158888">I see. Well, I will try to remain quiet about anything but the most basic information. I... sorry I wasted your time... and mine.</string>
  <string id="103461" soundid="158889">Do you actually want to talk? This is not the first time you have put off my request. You seemed sincere before, but now I wonder.</string>
  <string id="103462" soundid="158890">I do not mind waiting, but if you are only pretending to have an interest, then what is the point?</string>
  <string id="103463" soundid="158891">[Success] It is gratifying to hear you say so. I never meant to be a distraction. I have just always found the company of close friends very comforting in difficult times.</string>
  <string id="103464" soundid="158892">[Failure] No, I understand what you are unwilling to say. This isn&apos;t the time for personal concerns, even among old friends.</string>
  <string id="103465" soundid="158893">No, I didn&apos;t have anything pressing on my mind, although your company is always welcome. We seem so far from anything familiar.</string>
  <string id="103466" soundid="158894">Strange enemies, troubling plots; I will be glad when we can leave this place to find Master Li.</string>
  <string id="103467" soundid="158895">We should get in this Marvelous Dragonfly and go after Master Li&apos;s captors! Talk to Kang, and he will get us on our way.</string>
  <string id="103468" soundid="158896">Zu made it quite clear what we must do. We need a wind map, and we need a flyer. The longer we take, the farther away Master Li gets.</string>
  <string id="103469" soundid="158897">If that is your wish.</string>
  <string id="103470" soundid="158898">I do not like the area around this place, around Tien&apos;s Landing. There is rot here, deep in the heart of it. There are secrets, and there has been much suffering.</string>
  <string id="103471" soundid="158899">Maybe I just feel this way because of what happened at the school or what I fear will happen to Master Li. I just know we must be careful.</string>
  <string id="103472" soundid="158900">I will... but I cannot help worrying, or thinking about what has happened to Master Li.</string>
  <string id="103473" soundid="158901">Yes, of course. I am glad you are strong in the face of all the death and destruction we&apos;ve seen.</string>
  <string id="103474" soundid="158902">You weren&apos;t there. Neither of us knows what really went on. How can you say it wasn&apos;t the best course?</string>
  <string id="103475" soundid="158903">I... I know that, but he must have tried to do something... I don&apos;t know.</string>
  <string id="103476" soundid="158904">The lives of our friends are already lost. Master Li&apos;s life is still in jeopardy. How many others will come to depend on you? I fear your burden, not your ability.</string>
  <string id="103477" soundid="158905">I am glad to hear you say it. We must keep our heads clear to survive this. Is there anything else I can do for you?</string>
  <string id="103478" soundid="158906">We can&apos;t always choose such things. We can neither escape nor ignore what we are meant to do. I&apos;m sorry, is there something else we can talk about?</string>
  <string id="103479" soundid="158907">Be well, my friend.</string>
  <string id="103480" soundid="158908"></string>
  <string id="103481" soundid="158909">I don&apos;t think now is a good time to discuss things. I&apos;d rather not die in here, if you don&apos;t mind.</string>
  <string id="103482" soundid="158910">We should focus on getting to Jia. We can discuss things after we&apos;ve done that.</string>
  <string id="103483" soundid="158911">I suppose it is good that the Lotus Assassin Executioner accepted you. I wish I felt better about that.</string>
  <string id="103484" soundid="158912">Will you be heading to the Lotus Assassin fortress soon? When you are through there, the princess will take us to the palace.</string>
  <string id="103485" soundid="158913">At least, that&apos;s what she promised.</string>
  <string id="103486" soundid="158914">You&apos;ve appeased both of the Lotus Assassin recruiters. What else could we possibly need to do?</string>
  <string id="103487" soundid="158915">I dread the answer, but is there something the Inquisitor wants you to do as well?</string>
  <string id="103488" soundid="158916">Do we still need to finish that unpleasant business with Sheng, or can you just proceed to the fortress?</string>
  <string id="103489" soundid="158917">Yes? What do you need? I&apos;d like to get that business with Minister Sheng out of the way.</string>
  <string id="103490" soundid="158918">She worries about the poor minister, a man she would despise in any other circumstance.</string>
  <string id="103491" soundid="158919">Be careful in the Lotus Assassin fortress. They may not know you are an enemy, but they can still be dangerous.</string>
  <string id="103492" soundid="158920">Hurry to the palace. I hate it that Master Li is trapped there. Who knows what the Emperor is doing with him.</string>
  <string id="103493" soundid="158921">My father will explain. Death&apos;s Hand is behind this. You will see.</string>
  <string id="103494" soundid="158922">The Imperial City... I&apos;d always heard how impressive it was. The stories didn&apos;t do it justice.</string>
  <string id="103495" soundid="158923">I feel like I&apos;m a long way from home, and I don&apos;t even know where home is anymore.</string>
  <string id="103496" soundid="158924">If you want to go to the palace, you will have to talk to Princess Lian. She&apos;s the one who controls that path.</string>
  <string id="103497" soundid="158925">I can still have the map ready if you want to fly anywhere else, but we should get to the palace as soon as we have taken care of everything.</string>
  <string id="103498" soundid="158926">Very well, but let&apos;s not take too long. Master Li is waiting for us to rescue him.</string>
  <string id="103499" soundid="158927">Very well. I&apos;ll have the map ready.</string>
  <string id="103500" soundid="158928">Do you have time for me now? We should have spoken some time ago. If you do not wish me to burden you with my... attention, all you need to do is say so.</string>
  <string id="103501" soundid="158929">[Success] Thank you for that. This has been a difficult journey, and it is good to know such... close friends are thinking of me</string>
  <string id="103502" soundid="158930">I want to talk about what we have seen in the Imperial City. You are becoming more than a friend, and I value your perception.</string>
  <string id="103503" soundid="158931">[Failure] I see myself as only a distraction to you. Perhaps after all of this is done we can... I don&apos;t know.</string>
  <string id="103504" soundid="158932">I will keep my feelings to myself unless it is of the utmost importance. I don&apos;t want to distract from our rescue of Master Li.</string>
  <string id="103505" soundid="158933">[Success] I am sorry to distract you so, but it has been a burden for me, as well. </string>
  <string id="103506" soundid="158934">[Success] I am sorry. I know that you are doing your best. This is difficult for me, as well.</string>
  <string id="103507" soundid="158935">If that is the case, I will remain quiet unless discussing the most basic of our concerns. I... I&apos;m sorry I wasted your time... and mine.</string>
  <string id="103508" soundid="158936">I&apos;m sorry. I was foolish to disturb you in the first place, and it&apos;s indulgent of me to waste your time now. I just want... I&apos;m not sure what I want.</string>
  <string id="103509" soundid="158937">Rest assured that I know you have no interest in my personal concerns. I tried to speak with you a number of times, but you just put it off too long.</string>
  <string id="103510" soundid="158938">I will not bother you with this again, I promise that.</string>
  <string id="103511" soundid="158939">It is a bit late for that, and we have... more pressing concerns. Please, let&apos;s just get back to finding Master Li.</string>
  <string id="103512" soundid="158940">Do you really have an interest? I accepted your word before, but it seems you may have... exaggerated your concern.</string>
  <string id="103513" soundid="158941">If you don&apos;t want to pay attention to my... personal concerns, you need only say. We were content as friends.</string>
  <string id="103514" soundid="158942">[Success] I know I shouldn&apos;t need such assurances, but I do appreciate hearing you say such things. You are a great comfort in troubling times.</string>
  <string id="103515" soundid="158943">[Failure] Perhaps you didn&apos;t mean it, but that doesn&apos;t change much. We should just focus on the task at hand.</string>
  <string id="103516" soundid="158944">I don&apos;t mean to distract you. I just wanted someone familiar around me for a moment, if only to reassure me that we are still in the Empire I thought I knew.</string>
  <string id="103517" soundid="158945">I have long dreamed of reaching the Imperial City, but now that I have, under these circumstances, I am more overwhelmed than ever.</string>
  <string id="103518" soundid="158946">But that&apos;s what is bothering me. We can&apos;t be a long way from home, because our home is gone.</string>
  <string id="103519" soundid="158947">I can no longer say that what I see is strange or foreign, because I have lost what I would have compared it to. I am the one out of place now.</string>
  <string id="103520" soundid="158948">I... I would like that. To know you will be there, no matter what... I&apos;ve never had that stability. At least, not before joining the school.</string>
  <string id="103521" soundid="158949">As a child, I was marked by ill omens, apparently named for them. The people in Two Rivers were polite, but many did not hide the discomfort I caused them.</string>
  <string id="103522" soundid="158950">How do you deal with being able to sense the spirit world when people make such absurd conclusions?</string>
  <string id="103523" soundid="158951">That is horrible, but... I see what you mean. That is where they got their fear from in the first place, from tales of witch women and sorcerers. </string>
  <string id="103524" soundid="158952">I... did not expect this conversation to take this turn, but I still feel better. I am not quite comfortable with it yet, but I begin to see what has made you so strong.</string>
  <string id="103525" soundid="158953">I would like to continue this later. As always, I have much to think about after speaking with you.</string>
  <string id="103526" soundid="158954">I always just felt like a victim... but perhaps, like now, I was just out of place. Is that what you mean? I should feel superior because they did not understand me?</string>
  <string id="103527" soundid="158955">I... I cannot change who I am, I know. Perhaps I just have to let all of that go. It will not be easy.</string>
  <string id="103528" soundid="158956">But I do feel that you have given me a strength I did not have before. I... very much appreciate your support.</string>
  <string id="103529" soundid="158957">We should continue this discussion later. I have much to think about, and our work here has only just begun.</string>
  <string id="103530" soundid="158958">The Imperial City. I never dreamed I would reach it.</string>
  <string id="103531" soundid="158959">All right. What did you want to ask?</string>
  <string id="103532" soundid="158960">I suppose that is a reflex of mine. I cannot be excluded if I don&apos;t belong to begin with. That is why I did not participate much while at the school.</string>
  <string id="103533" soundid="158961">Get tough? I am quite capable of defending myself physically. Are you suggesting I harden my heart more than it already is? I already feel like an outsider.</string>
  <string id="103534" soundid="158962">What good is there in pointless rage? I have no desire to spend my days growing bitter over things I can&apos;t change.</string>
  <string id="103535" soundid="158963">[Success] I... I appreciate what I think you are saying, but the sentiment is so harsh. I don&apos;t want to become like the people who pushed me aside.</string>
  <string id="103536" soundid="158964">[Failure] No, it would be weak to fall into that kind of thinking just to protect myself from people who think exactly that way.</string>
  <string id="103537" soundid="158965">I&apos;m not sure what you are suggesting is all that healthy. Perhaps... perhaps we are not as similar as I thought.</string>
  <string id="103538" soundid="158966">I am sorry. I don&apos;t mean to distract you. I shouldn&apos;t be opening these old wounds while we have so much to do.</string>
  <string id="103539" soundid="158967">There was a time when I was more inclined to that kind of thought, but the stability of the school helped me find some measure of peace. </string>
  <string id="103540" soundid="158968">I suppose that is best. We should focus on the job ahead... and nothing else.</string>
  <string id="103541" soundid="158969">[Success] Perhaps I do, but how can I rationalize away my concern for others? I spent a long time suffering people who did the same to me.</string>
  <string id="103542" soundid="158970">[Success] I should stand up for myself more, I know that, but I don&apos;t want to become like the people who pushed me aside.</string>
  <string id="103543" soundid="158971">I don&apos;t want to seem ungrateful for her help, but having Silk Fox here is causing me some concern.</string>
  <string id="103544" soundid="158972">I mean, she is the daughter of the Emperor, and we do not know his role in Master Li&apos;s capture. Can she be trusted?</string>
  <string id="103545" soundid="158973">To you, perhaps, but not to me. I think I am perceived as a rival, but no one has told me what the game is.</string>
  <string id="103546" soundid="158974">She delights in taunting me, as though I were a child. If she is with us, why such hostility?</string>
  <string id="103547" soundid="158975">The Princess? The daughter of the Emperor is jealous of me? I think the size of our task has addled your senses.</string>
  <string id="103548" soundid="158976">What could I possibly have that would make her jealous? What does a woman from the borderlands have that the Princess herself does not?</string>
  <string id="103549" soundid="158977">W-what?</string>
  <string id="103550" soundid="158978">I&apos;m sorry. You caught me off guard for a moment.</string>
  <string id="103551" soundid="158979">Well that is... just foolish. Isn&apos;t it?</string>
  <string id="103552" soundid="158980">I am not! Why would you suggest that? And why did you smirk?</string>
  <string id="103553" soundid="158981">Are you... are you trying to pit us against each other? Does it amuse you to see people compete for your affection...?</string>
  <string id="103554" soundid="158982">Your affection... did I just say that? Well... damn you for being right.</string>
  <string id="103555" soundid="158983">You have always been a good friend to me, but I never meant... I mean, I couldn&apos;t....</string>
  <string id="103556" soundid="158984">No. No, I should have more control over this. This is too uncertain. You can&apos;t manipulate me into admitting something like this.</string>
  <string id="103557" soundid="158985">Not when you could leave whenever you want.</string>
  <string id="103558" soundid="158986">I prefer to have more control over myself, and as much control over what goes on around me as possible.</string>
  <string id="103559" soundid="158987">Silk Fox, or whatever she wants to be called, is an unknown I can&apos;t compensate for. I can&apos;t stay in balance if I don&apos;t know what she represents.</string>
  <string id="103560" soundid="158988">You and I, we talk and share thoughts, but she... forces me to consider where that might lead, both good and bad. I&apos;m not ready for that.</string>
  <string id="103561" soundid="158989">Don&apos;t you dare! Oh, you tease so much! I don&apos;t know what to do with you. You have become so different since we left Two Rivers.</string>
  <string id="103562" soundid="158990">Or perhaps it is me. For all the trouble we face, I feel like a weight is lifting.</string>
  <string id="103563" soundid="158991">I suppose it does. Strange that you are becoming more adept at reading my moods than I am.</string>
  <string id="103564" soundid="158992">I think we will have a great deal more to discuss in the coming days. I am... looking forward to it.</string>
  <string id="103565" soundid="158993">Until then, thank you for being so understanding. Master Li was right. You are special.</string>
  <string id="103566" soundid="158994">Then we are at an impasse, and I don&apos;t know how to get around it. I think... I think I am not ready for this.</string>
  <string id="103567" soundid="158995">Don&apos;t juggle your words. I am not amused by it. You know very well what I mean. It&apos;s probably at the front of your mind all the time, for all I know.</string>
  <string id="103568" soundid="158996">What? What do you mean?</string>
  <string id="103569" soundid="158997">Well, I would... I would.... I don&apos;t know. I... I&apos;m not used to thinking about that. I always felt that what came next was in someone else&apos;s hands.</string>
  <string id="103570" soundid="158998">I&apos;ve never been given that kind of choice before.</string>
  <string id="103571" soundid="158999"></string>
  <string id="103572" soundid="159000">[Success] I... I deserve not to be cast aside. I deserve better.</string>
  <string id="103573" soundid="159001"></string>
  <string id="103574" soundid="159002">[Failure] Be quiet! Just let me think. I don&apos;t like... I don&apos;t like what you are trying to do. You want me to lash out, to fight pain by giving it. I won&apos;t.</string>
  <string id="103575" soundid="159003">Why are you doing this? What are you trying to make me be? This isn&apos;t who I am.</string>
  <string id="103576" soundid="159004">I&apos;m sorry. I&apos;ve had enough. If you need anything for our current task, I will help, but I don&apos;t want to talk about this anymore.</string>
  <string id="103577" soundid="159005"></string>
  <string id="103578" soundid="159006">[Success] I... I can&apos;t justify it. I look at how much I fear and I can&apos;t.</string>
  <string id="103579" soundid="159007">I should... I should fight more. I should spit more. I should slap the princess in her smirking face, and I should... I should....</string>
  <string id="103580" soundid="159008">I should look at you without fear of what might happen, because if I grow to need you and you *leave,* ancestors help me, you will regret it.</string>
  <string id="103581" soundid="159009">Am I? Perhaps you should worry if you are worthy of mine. That is what you wish, isn&apos;t it? That I assert myself?</string>
  <string id="103582" soundid="159010">I did not intend for this to go as far as it has this quickly. I am startled by what you bring out in me. I need time to think.</string>
  <string id="103583" soundid="159011">You have introduced me to some interesting ideas. I thank you for that. I think I have been weak for too long.</string>
  <string id="103584" soundid="159012">Perhaps it is time that others started worrying about me. I thought striking back would lower me, but I don&apos;t know anymore.</string>
  <string id="103585" soundid="159013"></string>
  <string id="103586" soundid="159014"></string>
  <string id="103587" soundid="159015">[Success] They deserve... they deserve the worst I can imagine for making me weak.</string>
  <string id="103588" soundid="159016"></string>
  <string id="103589" soundid="159017">It is clear we have very different views about what is going on here. I&apos;m not sure I want to continue this. In fact, I am very sure.</string>
  <string id="103590" soundid="159018">If you wish something related to the task at hand, I will be happy to assist. Beyond that, I think we are done.</string>
  <string id="103591" soundid="159019">The situation is *useful?* Is that what I am here for? To be used? Will I be cast aside when you are done?</string>
  <string id="103592" soundid="159020">This is how it starts, you know. Soon there will be whispers and strange looks. I&apos;ve seen that before. I don&apos;t want to be a part of this.</string>
  <string id="103593" soundid="159021">So you don&apos;t trust her fully, but you invite her into our midst? I&apos;m not sure I understand that, especially when she is so confrontational.</string>
  <string id="103594" soundid="159022">We are much closer to finding our Master, but the path you are forced to take worries me, and I don&apos;t think the princess shares my concern.</string>
  <string id="103595" soundid="159023">We have faced these Lotus Assassins in small numbers before, but this is something different.</string>
  <string id="103596" soundid="159024">That is not what I meant. Hordes can be overcome. They are never the endless threat they appear to be.</string>
  <string id="103597" soundid="159025">What concerns me is how you have walked in their steps to fool them. I am... growing accustomed to you. I don&apos;t want to see this change you.</string>
  <string id="103598" soundid="159026">I have always respected your resolve, but there are dangers other than death. When you walk in the shadow of the enemy, you risk taking their shape.</string>
  <string id="103599" soundid="159027">You fought through the arena with your honor intact, but the Lotus Assassins will press you to commit far more vicious acts.</string>
  <string id="103600" soundid="159028">I don&apos;t want to win if it claims the good in you. What right do we have to harmony if we sacrifice what we believe to get it?</string>
  <string id="103601" soundid="159029">I know you won&apos;t, but it still does my heart good to hear it. The more I know about you, the more I want you to stay as you are.</string>
  <string id="103602" soundid="159030">It would be a shame for something to happen when we are... becoming close.</string>
  <string id="103603" soundid="159031">We will talk again. I... know everything will work out just fine.</string>
  <string id="103604" soundid="159032">What? It is very unlike you to say that. This is a different side of you from the one you have let me see so far.</string>
  <string id="103605" soundid="159033">How can you make a rightful claim to victory if, in the end, you are no better than the enemy we worked to defeat?</string>
  <string id="103606" soundid="159034">Yes, I suppose I should. It would appear that you already have.</string>
  <string id="103607" soundid="159035">You are very different from the boy I met at the school. Perhaps I am changing as well. I&apos;m sorry to have wasted your time. It won&apos;t happen again.</string>
  <string id="103608" soundid="159036">What? I suppose all that I know is what you have let me see. I thought I was getting close to your true self. Was I mistaken?</string>
  <string id="103609" soundid="159037">And if you sacrifice all the good that is in you, what then?</string>
  <string id="103610" soundid="159038">I don&apos;t dare judge you, but some of what I saw in the arena worried me. If you can act as you did, what will the Lotus Assassins bring out?</string>
  <string id="103611" soundid="159039">You found a way to appease the Lotus Assassins while sparing Minister Sheng. Will you be able to hide your honor when in their midst?</string>
  <string id="103612" soundid="159040">Minister Sheng paid the price for you to gain the favor of the Lotus Assassins. Who else will you be willing to sacrifice?</string>
  <string id="103613" soundid="159041">You embarrass me with such forward questions, but I think like that, as well. It bothers me that you risk so much to walk in the shadow of the enemy.</string>
  <string id="103614" soundid="159042">I see the necessity of walking in their steps to fool them, but I am... growing accustomed to you, and I don&apos;t want to see this change you.</string>
  <string id="103615" soundid="159043">It seems like such a long path, but we are getting closer to Master Li and those who took him. I am concerned about what is coming.</string>
  <string id="103616" soundid="159044">After all, the lair of the Lotus Assassins may hold a tempting power.</string>
  <string id="103617" soundid="159045">Nor should you. I know your strength, and how you place yourself above all others. You have shown how effective your way of thinking can be.</string>
  <string id="103618" soundid="159046">What? No, that isn&apos;t it at all. You have shown me that I shouldn&apos;t worry so much about the method so long as we approve of the result.</string>
  <string id="103619" soundid="159047">Ha! I have the utmost confidence in you. You have shown me what strength can be drawn from thinking of yourself first.</string>
  <string id="103620" soundid="159048">I know that if there is any power to be taken from the Lotus Assassins, you will take it. I am not concerned about that. Any help would be useful to us, despite the source.</string>
  <string id="103621" soundid="159049">I am more concerned that their presentation might be... seductive. You will not forget that our mission is to free our master, will you?</string>
  <string id="103622" soundid="159050">I knew you would stay true to our cause. If we turn the powers of our enemy against them, more the better.</string>
  <string id="103623" soundid="159051">It would be good to see someone else suffer for a change.</string>
  <string id="103624" soundid="159052">Why would this change surprise you? You showed me how fruitless it was to try and meet cruelty with grace. If that applies to my life, it certainly applies here.</string>
  <string id="103625" soundid="159053">If the methods of the Lotus Assassins bring us strength, you should use them. If you don&apos;t, and we lose Master Li again, you, not our enemy, will be the target of my anger.</string>
  <string id="103626" soundid="159054">Do I? I suppose I don&apos;t have the patience to let people change on their own anymore, but not many deserved it.</string>
  <string id="103627" soundid="159055">You helped me to see that, and I am grateful, even if it is taking me a while to get used to this darker view of the world.</string>
  <string id="103628" soundid="159056">As long as you stay with me, I know everything will work out just fine. I&apos;ve changed because of you... for you.</string>
  <string id="103629" soundid="159057">I&apos;m... I&apos;m glad. I won&apos;t lose you, or the chance to save Master Li. I can&apos;t.</string>
  <string id="103630" soundid="159058">Can we... get back to the task at hand? There will be time to speak about this later, when we get this hateful world back to normal.</string>
  <string id="103631" soundid="159059">I just want this to be over so we can... build new lives.</string>
  <string id="103632" soundid="159060">I was a fool. You made that clear the last time we talked. I was trying to find peace while making excuses for the behavior of others.</string>
  <string id="103633" soundid="159061">I tried to effect change by example, only I didn&apos;t know how to react when bad things continued to happen. Now I know better.</string>
  <string id="103634" soundid="159062">Our enemies should be served back whatever they throw at us. Make them reap what they sow. Our cause is too worthy to do otherwise.</string>
  <string id="103635" soundid="159063">This isn&apos;t what you wanted? Why convince me of this if it isn&apos;t to your liking?</string>
  <string id="103636" soundid="159064">[Success] I didn&apos;t think I was. When you wanted me to be stronger, I thought you meant like the Princess. Her concerns are all that matter to her.</string>
  <string id="103637" soundid="159065">I don&apos;t want to see the world like that, like I have to be as cold as those we fight. I don&apos;t want to think that you are like that.</string>
  <string id="103638" soundid="159066">What right do we have to win, if we can&apos;t tell ourselves from the enemy? I know my heart isn&apos;t like that. I want to believe yours isn&apos;t, either.</string>
  <string id="103639" soundid="159067">I... I need some time to think. Thank you for this. I feel as though I have turned away from a very dark path.</string>
  <string id="103640" soundid="159068">[Failure] What good does this admission do me? I am tired of trying to be what others want and of being cast aside when I fail.</string>
  <string id="103641" soundid="159069">W-what? But this was what you wanted, wasn&apos;t it? For me to give back the pain directed at me? Why convince me of this, if it will only drive you away?</string>
  <string id="103642" soundid="159070">I... I can&apos;t do this anymore. I tried to be what you wanted, but it isn&apos;t enough. I don&apos;t know who I am, or who you want me to be.</string>
  <string id="103643" soundid="159071">I think... I think I need to let this go. Master Li should be our focus. This only clouds my eyes... and my heart.</string>
  <string id="103644" soundid="159072">If you need anything, I will be here, but I don&apos;t think these talks are helping. Maybe... when everything is done. I&apos;m sorry for wasting your time.</string>
  <string id="103645" soundid="159073">If you subjugated the whole of their order, that would be very useful to us, indeed. I wouldn&apos;t be against that. We could use them to our advantage against their leaders.</string>
  <string id="103646" soundid="159074">It is just about time, isn&apos;t it? The Emperor or Death&apos;s Hand or whoever can only keep us from our Master for so long.</string>
  <string id="103647" soundid="159075">So much has happened to get us here: our hard work, the loss of Sagacious Zu. I am looking forward to having our questions answered.</string>
  <string id="103648" soundid="159076">I... also don&apos;t want to worry about you anymore. What if you are next to fall?</string>
  <string id="103649" soundid="159077">I think I trust you now, but I am not sure what should come next. This seems like such an uncertain time to be making plans for the future.</string>
  <string id="103650" soundid="159078">You have a very odd way of twisting a sentiment. How should I react to such a &quot;comfort?&quot; It is, I suppose, better than nothing.</string>
  <string id="103651" soundid="159079">Listen to me. I think I am used to this new life, laughing about the danger we will face, about whether we will survive. Is this what &quot;normal&quot; has become?</string>
  <string id="103652" soundid="159080">I feel selfish for trying to find peace while this war of ours continues. If... when we free Master Li, that will be the more appropriate time for this.</string>
  <string id="103653" soundid="159081">I doubt you need any more incentive, but I am glad I have that effect.</string>
  <string id="103654" soundid="159082">Now it is just up to the princess to keep her word, and we can end this. Everything will be all right again. I know it.</string>
  <string id="103655" soundid="159083">Don&apos;t mistake my caution for reluctance. I have come to see how important you are to me, but... I&apos;m sorry, I need to know that this will be over soon.</string>
  <string id="103656" soundid="159084">If the princess keeps her word, we can leave for the palace when you are ready. Then it will feel like the end is near, like we can go home.</string>
  <string id="103657" soundid="159085">We are very close to our goal now, aren&apos;t we? I am growing impatient for answers. We have pushed against the walls blocking our way, and it&apos;s about time we broke through.</string>
  <string id="103658" soundid="159086">After suffering so much and losing Sagacious Zu, I think this Emperor owes us a great deal.</string>
  <string id="103659" soundid="159087">I think we are owed time to be safe together. If you were the next to fall, I would never forgive you.</string>
  <string id="103660" soundid="159088">That sounds more like a war cry than a sign of affection, but I suppose I should expect nothing less. Everything is a matter of strength to you.</string>
  <string id="103661" soundid="159089">As long as your boasts match your action, I will be happy. I am looking forward to something for the first time in a great while. I know you will not disappoint.</string>
  <string id="103662" soundid="159090">Smirk all you like, but the threat is real. I feel selfish pushing for what I want while this war of ours is ongoing, but I will have no such reservations when it is done.</string>
  <string id="103663" soundid="159091">I am looking forward to something for the first time in a great while. You should not disappoint me.</string>
  <string id="103664" soundid="159092">What? But this is what you wanted, isn&apos;t it? You said I needed to put myself first. Why convince me of this if it would only drive you away?</string>
  <string id="103665" soundid="159093">It is too late for apologies. I need consistency, and I am not finding it with you. </string>
  <string id="103666" soundid="159094">I should hope so. I&apos;m still a stranger in my own skin. If I don&apos;t encourage you to succeed, what good are the changes I have tried to make?</string>
  <string id="103667" soundid="159095">Let&apos;s just get this over with. Once we rescue Master Li, we can turn our minds to more... pleasing thoughts.</string>
  <string id="103668" soundid="159096">That is really not necessary right now, although I do enjoy the attention. We have come so far together. Thank you for that.</string>
  <string id="103669" soundid="159097">I&apos;ve only been here as long as you have. I doubt I have any information you would find useful.</string>
  <string id="103670" soundid="159098">So much has happened... so much death. Sagacious Zu&apos;s sacrifice weighs on my mind.</string>
  <string id="103671" soundid="159099">Now I understand why he was so troubled. It wasn&apos;t cowardice that led to his exile from the Lotus Assassins, it was conscience.</string>
  <string id="103672" soundid="159100">He must have wanted to oppose them, even if he didn&apos;t realize it at first, but that would have meant his superiors were wrong, a far graver thing than just being evil.</string>
  <string id="103673" soundid="159101">What must it be like, to be so devoted that it was easier to imagine a deficiency in himself than to confront the truth of the Emperor&apos;s evil?</string>
  <string id="103674" soundid="159102">We have to make sure this can never happen again. I know we will. We have to.</string>
  <string id="103675" soundid="159103">Hurry to the palace. I can&apos;t bear to think of Master Li remaining in the hands of this Emperor a moment longer.</string>
  <string id="103676" soundid="159104">And yet, he still did what he thought he must. We can&apos;t let that action be for nothing.</string>
  <string id="103677" soundid="159105">He was flawed, as we all are, but he still managed to do what he thought he must. We can&apos;t let that action be for nothing. </string>
  <string id="103678" soundid="159106">Sagacious Zu seemed very certain that Death&apos;s Hand is no normal opponent. He was also very deliberate in his actions, like he knew the fight was inevitable.</string>
  <string id="103679" soundid="159107">I don&apos;t like it, but you have to get as close to the Lotus Assassins as you can to gain access to their fortress.</string>
  <string id="103680" soundid="159108">That&apos;s what the Princess wants, and she is our passage to the palace.</string>
  <string id="103681" soundid="180318">Grr... he presumes to trap us, too. He is too strong to fight alone, but you can use the strength of your followers. What else are they good for?</string>
  <string id="103682" soundid="159110">Let&apos;s get what we need and get out of here. Just do whatever your &quot;master&quot; wants so we can get into the inner chambers of the fortress.</string>
  <string id="103684" soundid="159112">As much as I think it is foolishly dangerous, you need to go to the Lotus Assassin fortress and find the information the Princess needs.</string>
  <string id="103685" soundid="159113">Very well, but we should get that business with Minister Sheng out of the way.</string>
  <string id="103686" soundid="159114">Don&apos;t go too far. I&apos;d get lost in this city. I know it.</string>
  <string id="103687" soundid="159115">This is all so much to absorb. I would appreciate your counsel if you have time to speak privately.</string>
  <string id="103688" soundid="159116">Are you ready to go? You said that we needed to deal with Sheng, and I don&apos;t want to leave the matter too long.</string>
  <string id="103689" soundid="159117">Yes? I like to think that we can take time to talk about... important things.</string>
  <string id="103690" soundid="159118">What did you want to talk about?</string>

  <string id="103692" soundid="159120">Don&apos;t look at me. It is bad enough I feel your will within my mind. I don&apos;t want to see your face.</string>

  <string id="103694" soundid="159122">No, don&apos;t make me suffer this. What we shared was... was a lie! Do not shame me further.</string>
  <string id="103695" soundid="159123">I care for you.</string>
  <string id="103696" soundid="159124">I would turn my head in shame if my body would let me. Will the Empire itself be forced to look at you in the same way?</string>
  <string id="103697" soundid="159125">Just... just go.</string>
  <string id="103698" soundid="159126">[Dawn Star obediently remains quiet.]</string>
  <string id="103699" soundid="159127">You can make me do what you want, but you will never again have what I once freely gave.</string>
  <string id="103700" soundid="159128">Do not mock me now by claiming my feelings are a surprise. You knew my horror when you chose this fate for me.</string>
  <string id="103701" soundid="159129">That this comes after what we shared makes it all the more a betrayal. I was at your side by choice. Now you stand alone, whether I am there or not.</string>
  <string id="103702" soundid="159130">Now I see the scars of Master Li&apos;s betrayal clearer than ever. You truly are a wounded child.</string>
  <string id="103703" soundid="159131">There is no strength in this. Only the most insecure leader would command such forced obedience.</string>
  <string id="103704" soundid="159132">Are you so fearful of opposition? Poor child, grasping for control.</string>
  <string id="103705" soundid="159133">No, it was *not!* If you had listened to my concerns, I would have stayed by you of my own free will.</string>
  <string id="103706" soundid="159134">I am never alone. You were always in my mind. Now it is no longer my choice, and it means nothing.</string>

  <string id="103708" soundid="159136">So many changes. The Jade Empire is not the place I once thought it was.</string>
  <string id="103709" soundid="159137">The closer we get to power, the more I love what you are becoming. So many lies... the Empire needs your firm hand.</string>
  <string id="103710" soundid="159138">Death&apos;s Hand is a fine symbol of your power. The princess and Sky are fools for not seeing his worth. Someone has to turn the evils of others to good.</string>
  <string id="103711" soundid="159139">Ha ha ha! There will be time for whatever you want. If nothing else, I can depend on you to make the world suit your schedule.</string>
  <string id="103712" soundid="159140">Everyone else in my life has betrayed what they were supposed to stand for. You alone have stayed true in your actions and words.</string>
  <string id="103713" soundid="159141">Will there be time for us? If we take it.</string>
  <string id="103714" soundid="159142">Good. I used to think that harmony and balance would save the world. Now I know that those are just words misused by everyone.</string>
  <string id="103715" soundid="159143">Am I? Perhaps, but that is only because you have shown me that the world is a cold place.</string>
  <string id="103716" soundid="159144">I was destined to be forever a victim, but no longer. I thank you for that, and I will stand by you whatever comes.</string>
  <string id="103717" soundid="159145">If that is what is needed to rid the world of the fools that endangered the Empire, so be it. Better you than anyone else.</string>
  <string id="103718" soundid="159146">You have shown me that no one else is worthy of that seat of power. I know you will make things as right as they can be.</string>
  <string id="103719" soundid="159147">Go on now, we have been over this. You will shape the Empire with the firm hand it needs, unlike all the unworthy betrayers we have fought.</string>
  <string id="103720" soundid="159148">I have no doubt that there will be. When everything is restored to the way it was, we will be able to return to the lives we lost.</string>
  <string id="103721" soundid="159149">It won&apos;t be perfect, I know, but I even miss the simple heartache of mortal sorrow. Our time among the gods has forced greater worries upon us.</string>
  <string id="103722" soundid="159150">Will there be time for us? More than anything, I hope so.</string>
  <string id="103723" soundid="159151">Your resolve is inspiring. The Master Li I thought I knew would be proud. The man we now face should be worried.</string>
  <string id="103724" soundid="159152">There is a great deal of temptation ahead of you. I know you will make your decisions carefully.</string>
  <string id="103725" soundid="159153">I know you won&apos;t make the same mistakes your master did.</string>
  <string id="103726" soundid="159154">You asked me once already, and I still have no doubt. When all is restored, the normal troubles of mortal living will seem like the greatest blessings.</string>
  <string id="103727" soundid="159155">I hope there is room left in you for compassion. Two others before you have walked the road of power and corruption. Please learn from their mistakes.</string>
  <string id="103728" soundid="159156">And well they should. There must be punishment for the evil that has come to pass, and there must be control to ensure it does not happen again.</string>
  <string id="103729" soundid="159157">Please, it pains me to see you struggling under such anger. Let my love guide you away from the corruption of revenge and mindless power. I know your heart.</string>
  <string id="103730" soundid="159158">I know, and perhaps the greatest and hardest of those is yet to come. So much is on your shoulders.</string>
  <string id="103731" soundid="159159">I do not envy you, but I will be with you, my friend. We will make sure the Empire does not fall to the desires of a corrupted few.</string>
  <string id="103732" soundid="159160">I will be there when you take control. We will make certain that no one can harm the people of the Empire again.</string>
  <string id="103733" soundid="159161">When the time comes, we will reveal what evils have been done in the name of power. We will make certain this cannot happen again. You and I.</string>
  <string id="103734" soundid="159162">I know everything will be fine. You will see to it.</string>
  <string id="103735" soundid="159163">Sky was a fool to betray you. All traitors will receive what they deserve. All of them.</string>
  <string id="103736" soundid="159164">I know you will make things right. You have shown me what needs to be done.</string>
  <string id="103737" soundid="159165">It pains me to see Sky a prisoner of your will. I know it was the most gentle of punishments available to you, but it is still sad.</string>
  <string id="103738" soundid="159166">What Master Li has done is unforgivable. We have to set things right, and undo the evil he has put in motion.</string>
  <string id="103739" soundid="159167"></string>
  <string id="103740" soundid="159168">What&apos;s the matter, Dawn Star? Are you scared that Master Li might find out?</string>
  <string id="103741" soundid="159169">There is talk of approaching bandits, and you bother me with unsubtle advances? How very like you, Gao. No doubt a tactic learned from your criminal father.</string>
  <string id="103742" soundid="159170">His name is Gao the Greater, and he built a fortune out of some ragged thieves and slave traders. If my charm can&apos;t lift your spirit, I&apos;ll buy the ground from under you.</string>
  <string id="103743" soundid="159171">Flaunting your father&apos;s undeserved wealth does not impress me, Gao. It only serves to push me further away.</string>
  <string id="103744" soundid="159172">You step beyond your station. She and I are discussing her future.</string>
  <string id="103745" soundid="159173">Thank you, Gao, but I&apos;ll pick my own poison. Now leave, and, if you&apos;d be so kind, stay downwind.</string>
  <string id="103746" soundid="159174">I won&apos;t forget this, Dawn Star. You show great disrespect.</string>
  <string id="103747" soundid="159175">You, as well. You will not take all the glory if there is an attack. We are not through.</string>
  <string id="103748" soundid="159176">Ugh. He is Gao the *Lesser* in all respects. I thought Master Li allowed him to stay so that the influence of the father could be countered, but Gao never learns.</string>
  <string id="103749" soundid="159177">He acts like he is above Master Li&apos;s teachings. Such are the conceits of wealth, I suppose. I appreciate that you arrived when you did.</string>
  <string id="103750" soundid="159178">You&apos;ve said so already. I&apos;m fine. What brings you here?</string>
  <string id="103751" soundid="159179">That is nice to hear. Gao could learn much from you, if he wanted to learn anything from anyone.</string>
  <string id="103752" soundid="159180">Please, he&apos;s not worth it. Let&apos;s just move on. What brings you here?</string>
  <string id="103753" soundid="159181">What does Gao the Lesser ever want? He is convinced that he can buy everything, and that includes people. He is a spoiled little man.</string>
  <string id="103754" soundid="159182">I&apos;d rather not dwell on him. Let&apos;s not increase his influence by talking about him after he&apos;s gone. What is it you wish?</string>
  <string id="103755" soundid="159183">Yes, he said you were coming. He just passed here with Si Pat, on his way to help Kia Min. It&apos;s strange that simple bandits would launch such a raid.</string>
  <string id="103756" soundid="159184">Master Li was concerned that this would interrupt your training. His respect for your potential is just so... absolute. Has he told you any more about your future?</string>
  <string id="103757" soundid="159185">Only what Master Li has told you in the past: You are meant for great things, but you must discover them yourself.</string>
  <string id="103758" soundid="159186">It must be so frustrating, but exciting, as well.</string>
  <string id="103759" soundid="159187">It is not the same. You are filled with the promise of great things, even if they are unknown. My skills will always be darker.</string>
  <string id="103760" soundid="159188">I can see into the spiritual, an ability that grants some insight, but it doesn&apos;t seem to be useful for anything other than keeping me awake at night.</string>
  <string id="103761" soundid="159189">I helped Master Li discover the unrest that shapes your future, but I see only problems, while you are destined to find solutions. I envy you for that.</string>
  <string id="103762" soundid="159190">I&apos;m glad. You have always kept your feet on the ground. What does Master Li say? That you should keep the basics close to heart?</string>
  <string id="103769">Hello, Dawn Star. I hope I&apos;m not interrupting.</string>
  <string id="103775">I don&apos;t like seeing you upset.</string>
  <string id="103776">What did Gao want?</string>
  <string id="103778">You know about the bandits. Master Li said to get a weapon from Gujin.</string>
  <string id="103780">Not specifically. What do you know about it?</string>
  <string id="103782">He has told you similar things. You have talents, too.</string>
  <string id="103785">Please don&apos;t put me on a pedestal. I&apos;d rather stand beside my friends.</string>
  <string id="103787">Let&apos;s go together. I could use the company.</string>
  <string id="103788">Goodbye, then.</string>
  <string id="103790">Could I ask you a few more questions?</string>
  <string id="103791">Where can I find Gujin?</string>
  <string id="103793">How did you help Master Li find out about the restless dead?</string>
  <string id="103796">What do you know about the spirit world?</string>
  <string id="103799">What makes them so threatening?</string>
  <string id="103802">What happens to them in the underworld?</string>
  <string id="103805">That&apos;s all for now.</string>
  <string id="103808">And well you should. I am bound for great things.</string>
  <string id="103810">He thinks it will encourage me. I&apos;m tired of it. Aren&apos;t you?</string>
  <string id="103812">No. I have a bad feeling, Dawn Star.</string>
  <string id="103813">I&apos;m sure nothing is going to happen.</string>
  <string id="103815">I don&apos;t remember. I&apos;m sure it was nothing.</string>
  <string id="103816">Speculation is a fool&apos;s game. He&apos;ll tell me soon enough.</string>
  <string id="103818">Hello, Dawn Star. I certainly hope I *am* interrupting.</string>
  <string id="103819">It sounds like Dawn Star would like you to leave, Gao.</string>
  <string id="103822">Do you want to talk about the attack?</string>
  <string id="103825">Where did you live before you came to the school?</string>
  <string id="103828">Why did you move around? How did you come here?</string>
  <string id="103832">It is troubling to not know your past.</string>
  <string id="103834">Does your ability have any practical use?</string>
  <string id="103837">Your name is unusual. Is it a title?</string>
  <string id="103840">How this affects you doesn&apos;t matter. I have more important questions.</string>
  <string id="103841">Perhaps later.</string>
  <string id="103847">x</string>

  <string id="103859">Master Li does what he must. He is our master.</string>
  <string id="103861">Master Li does a lot of confusing things.</string>
  <string id="103865">Master Li is a fool. I can&apos;t wait to leave.</string>
  <string id="103869">I didn&apos;t want to fight them all, but there was no real choice.</string>
  <string id="103880">He kidnapped you so you wouldn&apos;t get caught in an attack?</string>
  <string id="103882">We have to try. There has to be a way!</string>
  <string id="103884">I just need to know if we can control it safely.</string>
  <string id="103888">So it&apos;s like flying a swimming ox. Well *that* helps.</string>
  <string id="103891">I tried to understand his trouble, but he won&apos;t let me.</string>
  <string id="103894">We&apos;re wasting time. If we are going, let&apos;s go!</string>
  <string id="103896">Fine, I guess we just hope for the best.</string>

  <string id="104224">Then you need to learn how to get tough. I can help with that.</string>
  <string id="104225">Focus on anger. Hate what was taken instead of fearing what might be lost.</string>

  <string id="104453" soundid="159881">I would welcome another match with you, though. What&apos;s say, one more before we break for the day?</string>
  <string id="104454" soundid="159882">You&apos;ve lost none of your acid wit, I see. Maybe you&apos;d like to back that up. What&apos;s say one more bout before Master Li steals you away?</string>

  <string id="104469">You stumbled across an obscure diagram that seems to indicate a configuration for a machine. A small stone with medical runes surrounding it seems to be a key component. The rest of the diagram shows a connection between some sort of lightning enshrouded globe held by a mechanical arm, which seems linked to a pagoda or pyramid-topped machine belching smoke, which in turn seems connected to a series of large gears. The diagram has a series of dragon etchings in the corner; whether or not they&apos;re related is hard to say.</string>

  <string id="104641" soundid="160078">Well, what have we here? More outlaws? They&apos;re everywhere! Gao was right to order them killed, even if just to keep the camp clear while he secures his woman.</string>
  <string id="104642" soundid="160079">This ain&apos;t one of ours, soldier! You can&apos;t fool us! If Gao wants us out of the swamp you&apos;ll have to fight us every step!</string>
  <string id="104643" soundid="160080">What is this? More bandits, but coming from the camp? Gao&apos;s let us get overrun! Get them!</string>
  <string id="104644" soundid="162493">It seems like we&apos;ve lost things we didn&apos;t even know we had. I don&apos;t want that to happen again, whatever happens, no matter how Master Li reacts.</string>

  <string id="104725">That&apos;ll show you!</string>
  <string id="104726" soundid="160167">Why do you need to ask me about Dawn Star? You know her better than anyone, as far as I&apos;m concerned. You two practically grew up together.</string>
  <string id="104727" soundid="160168">Frankly, I think she might have a little crush on you, too. Notice how she&apos;s been less willing to train with you recently?</string>
  <string id="104728" soundid="160169">Lin! That&apos;s not the reason why at all. I just want to avoid being a distraction.</string>

  <string id="104749" soundid="160195">Really? You would have dropped everything to make way for me? I don&apos;t think so. You&apos;re far too important to waste time worrying about my education.</string>
  <string id="104750" soundid="160196">Master Li certainly considers your training important enough to shove all others aside, so why shouldn&apos;t *I* bow down to your greatness?</string>
  <string id="104751" soundid="160197">What? The &quot;old man?&quot; That&apos;s what he is. Young men don&apos;t get mired in foolish beliefs, like the belief that your training is more important than everyone else&apos;s.</string>

  <string id="105190" soundid="160761">It would be an honor, though I doubt I&apos;ll offer as much of a challenge as Master Smiling Hawk.</string>
  <string id="105191" soundid="160762">I&apos;ve been trying to find that out myself. I even sent a few of the students into the city to see if they could discover the truth.</string>
  <string id="105192" soundid="160763">Master Smiling Hawk was the last to speak with Second Brother, though I still don&apos;t know what they discussed. It&apos;s no secret that they disliked each other.</string>
  <string id="105193" soundid="160764">Third Brother told me that Master Smiling Hawk sent Second Brother into the city, on an errand, but nobody saw him leave the school.</string>
  <string id="105194" soundid="160765">I fear Second Brother has run into trouble, and I suspect Master Smiling Hawk is behind it all.</string>
  <string id="105195">What do you think happened to Second Brother?</string>
  <string id="105199" soundid="160773">It would seem Master Radiant is up to his tricks again. Regardless, I can&apos;t fight you until you&apos;ve defeated Sixth Brother. Is there something else I can do for you?</string>
  <string id="105200">What do you think happened to Second Brother?</string>

  <string id="105242">That&apos;ll show you!</string>
  <string id="105243" soundid="160821">That was quite a fight with Fifth Brother, Fourth Brother is eagerly awaiting his chance.</string>
  <string id="105244" soundid="160822">Good work defeating Sixth Brother. Now you can move on to Fifth Brother.</string>
  <string id="105245" soundid="160823">Is there something I can help you with in the meantime?</string>
  <string id="105249">Didn&apos;t hurt?!</string>

  <string id="105279">That&apos;ll show you!</string>
  <string id="105280">I can&apos;t do anything?!</string>
  <string id="105281">I&apos;ll stop you!</string>
  <string id="105282">You won&apos;t do this!</string>
  <string id="105283">I won&apos;t let you do this!</string>
  <string id="105284">That&apos;s enough for you!</string>
  <string id="105285">No more!</string>
  <string id="105286">This can&apos;t happen!</string>

  <string id="105493" soundid="161122">Because we could not trust anyone else to have it!</string>
  <string id="105494" soundid="161123">Yes, we know this, but it must be used for the right reasons!</string>
  <string id="105495" soundid="161124">The hunter spoke of a ritual that would let him reach the Forest Shadow, but he is a fool! He thinks to find the fox and seek out her help. Her help!</string>
  <string id="105496" soundid="161125">She will not help anyone, least of all us at the inn. To save the hunter from his own folly we took the crystal before he could reach the temple.</string>
  <string id="105497" soundid="161126">That is it exactly!</string>
  <string id="105498" soundid="161127">Yes! You see, we did not know if we could trust you to kill the fox.</string>

  <string id="105500" soundid="161129">Whatever the ritual does, if it reaches the Forest Shadow then we must take the opportunity to destroy her once and for all. He would not have taken that chance.</string>

  <string id="105502" soundid="161131">You could, though you would not find the silver. I am not fool enough to keep it out in the open when I run such a *fine* establishment.</string>
  <string id="105503" soundid="161132">If you wish the crystal, you must agree to help us. You must kill the fox. The silver is merely an incentive.</string>
  <string id="105504" soundid="161133">You will aid us. You must.</string>
  <string id="105505" soundid="161134">You should be more certain. The Forest Shadow is a blight upon this forest, and you must destroy her.</string>
  <string id="105506" soundid="161135">Since you possess such skill in combat, we will take a chance that you will do what is right. Our offer of silver stands firm.</string>
  <string id="105507" soundid="161136">You are a fool! The Forest Shadow is nothing next to us.</string>
  <string id="105508" soundid="161137">Hmm. Very well. Consider it a deal between us.</string>
  <string id="105509" soundid="161138">I have faith that you possess the skills to eliminate this cursed fox!</string>
  <string id="105510" soundid="161139">You are so very, very foolish.</string>
  <string id="105511" soundid="161140">You do not know who you dare to threaten, but you will. Yes, you will. Look upon us as we really are!</string>
  <string id="105512" soundid="161141">No, no. It is nothing for you to trouble yourself about. The fox is our problem, and we will deal with her as best we can. You should stay and be comfortable.</string>
  <string id="105513" soundid="161142">And I tell you that the only cure is to destroy the fox! But I do not believe you are committed to that course of action.</string>
  <string id="105515" soundid="161144">As loathe as I am to see you go before dinner, perhaps you could find more answers at her temple, instead of worrying about us.</string>
  <string id="105516" soundid="161145">It is a matter of caution. We mean no disrespect to you, but we must be careful. The fox is crafty, and it is likely she will try to stop us.</string>
  <string id="105517" soundid="161146">If you are so ardent to learn more, perhaps you should go to her temple, just down the hill to the west. It is not a safe place for us, or you for that matter, but you may learn something.</string>
  <string id="105518" soundid="161147">Of course. It is, as I said, nothing for you to trouble yourself about.</string>
  <string id="105519" soundid="161148">I wish you all the best. Travel safely and return here soon. We would welcome you for our evening meal.</string>
  <string id="105520">What are you?</string>
  <string id="105522">This is why you want the fox dead! You&apos;re monsters!</string>
  <string id="105527">I really need to know what you planned. Maybe I can help?</string>
  <string id="105528">Forget it. Let&apos;s talk about something else.</string>
  <string id="105529">Fine. I do have some questions for you.</string>
  <string id="105530">I&apos;ll find my answers somewhere else.</string>
  <string id="105532">Why were you keeping this?</string>
  <string id="105534">That crystal is the key to reaching the Forest Shadow!</string>
  <string id="105537">You stole the crystal to stop the ritual from being performed?</string>
  <string id="105539">That explains why you didn&apos;t tell me about this before.</string>
  <string id="105541">If you&apos;re smart, you&apos;ll just hand that crystal to me right now.</string>
  <string id="105544">I could just kill you and take both the crystal and the silver.</string>
  <string id="105546">If what you say is true, then it sounds as if I have no choice.</string>
  <string id="105549">I won&apos;t take blood money, but I&apos;m not leaving without that crystal.</string>
  <string id="105551">[Lie] Give me the crystal, I&apos;ll make sure she&apos;s eliminated.</string>
  <string id="105553">For that much silver, consider the fox dead.</string>
  <string id="105555">I don&apos;t trust you. Give me the gem or I will take it.</string>
  <string id="105558">Can we talk more about your plan to deal with the fox spirit?</string>
  <string id="105559">The Forest Shadow *is* my problem. I need a cure for this forest.</string>
  <string id="105562">I don&apos;t understand why you won&apos;t help me.</string>
  <string id="105564">Forget your plan, let&apos;s go back to my other questions.</string>
  <string id="105569" soundid="161285">I knew it. You should have crushed him when he first arrived and was at least winded from facing the demons.</string>
  <string id="105570" soundid="161286">I knew we could not trust her. We should not have wasted our breath on this pretender to the Spirit Monks.</string>
  <string id="105571" soundid="161287">You will not make it that far. I will see to it.</string>
  <string id="105572" soundid="161288">Shining Tusk has been with me for centuries. He is my guardian, and my friend.</string>
  <string id="105574" soundid="161290">Humans expect all celestials to be like your flighty foxes, it seems.</string>
  <string id="105575" soundid="161291">Elephant demons are not noted for their humor. Shining Tusk is one of the most light-hearted of his kind. Be glad you did not meet him several centuries ago.</string>
  <string id="105576" soundid="161292">Woe betide anyone who called me &quot;surly&quot; back then. The Forest Shadow&apos;s brethren have worn away some of my stern nature.</string>
  <string id="105577" soundid="161293">The politics and structure of the Celestial Bureaucracy are staggeringly complex, so I won&apos;t waste time trying to explain the intricacies.</string>
  <string id="105578" soundid="161294">When I became the guardian of the Great Southern Forest, my responsibilities were such that it was deemed I needed his services.</string>
  <string id="105579" soundid="161295">It was an honor to become her guardian. She is not like any other fox spirit.</string>
  <string id="105581" soundid="161297">Is there anything else you would know?</string>
  <string id="105582" soundid="161298">You should ready yourself, Mistress. I do not trust them.</string>
  <string id="105583" soundid="161299">You are too quick to turn away potential allies, Shining Tusk. We know our enemy, this one may yet prove to be a friend.</string>
  <string id="105584" soundid="161300">Even with the Heavenly Gate Guardian here, I do not know that we can afford trust.</string>
  <string id="105585" soundid="161301">Chai Ka: From what I have sensed in the forest, you are right to be cautious.</string>
  <string id="105586" soundid="161302">I am not the only one, Guardian. You have much to contend with, it seems.</string>
  <string id="105587">Clay Debris</string>
  <string id="105588" soundid="161304">The Guardian doesn&apos;t have anything to else say. You should talk to the fox, and not worry about us. We&apos;re fine.</string>
  <string id="105590" soundid="161306">A friend who reeks of those beasts at the inn? Hmmph. Do what you wish, Mistress, but I will be watching.</string>
  <string id="105591" soundid="161307">You have just met my guardian, Shining Tusk. He is slow to trust, and quick to anger, but he will not harm you. Not without cause.</string>
  <string id="105592">I mean you no harm.</string>
  <string id="105597">What is he talking about, Chai Ka?</string>

  <string id="105637" soundid="161353">Curses, there were two of them weren&apos;t there? I should have known better than to let them stroll by.</string>
  <string id="105638" soundid="161354">They pulled up a small barge just around the bend and walked over to this beach. Tried to ask me some questions, but I shooed them away so I could clean the statue.</string>
  <string id="105639" soundid="161355">Then I hear there&apos;s bandits coming. Twenty years ago, I&apos;d have put together that those were scouts. I&apos;m sure you taught them a lesson.</string>

  <string id="105652" soundid="161368">Nice little town you have here. Not a lot of guards, are there? How are your stocks of food?</string>
  <string id="105653" soundid="161369">I don&apos;t know you. Why are you asking me all these questions?</string>
  <string id="105654" soundid="161370">This town isn&apos;t well guarded. Forget it, let&apos;s just start looting. We&apos;ll get first crack at the good stuff.</string>

  <string id="106075" soundid="161848">Well, hello... hello there. Sorry... you just caught me in the middle of eating. Ha! Who am I kidding... I&apos;m always eating. What can I do for you?</string>
  <string id="106076" soundid="161849">Ah... I am Chai Jin, master cook... and a master of enjoying the fruits of my labor, as my sizable girth would suggest. You&apos;ve never had food like mine before, I&apos;ll wager.</string>
  <string id="106077" soundid="161850">If you are really daring, I have one last dish that I haven&apos;t even had the nerve to try myself. I&apos;m sure it&apos;s safe.... I think. Well, there&apos;s no telling how it might affect us.</string>
  <string id="106078" soundid="161851">This new dish has no name yet, or at least none that I can pronounce. I learned it from a loud, annoying foreign man I met in the Imperial City.</string>
  <string id="106080" soundid="161853">I would dearly love to try it, but I&apos;m afraid I&apos;ve sampled too much of Shengdang&apos;s finest today to try something this exotic. The stomach can only take so much, you see.</string>
  <string id="106081" soundid="161854">My uncle died trying too many new dishes in a short period. It&apos;s a risk all Shangdang cooks face. The mastery of the art comes in knowing when to stop.</string>
  <string id="106082" soundid="161855">Excellent. Now, if you can, try to describe the taste to me, and what it does to you... and remember, this is for posterity, so please... be honest.</string>
  <string id="106083" soundid="161856">You survived! What I wouldn&apos;t give to have you around my kitchen back home. Simply astounding!</string>
  <string id="106084" soundid="161857">Well, how did it taste? What did it do to you?</string>
  <string id="106085" soundid="161858">Every aspect? Now that is dangerous, indeed, but highly intriguing. There are few dishes short of poison that have that capability.</string>
  <string id="106086" soundid="161859">Please, take your silver, and take this. It&apos;s a small trinket that belonged to my family. I have no use for it, and you&apos;ve certainly earned it.</string>
  <string id="106087" soundid="161860">Really? Well, maybe it would be safe for me to try... just a bite.</string>
  <string id="106088" soundid="161861"></string>
  <string id="106089" soundid="161862">[Success] Yes... I suppose you&apos;re right. All right, I&apos;ll give it a try.</string>
  <string id="106090" soundid="161863"></string>
  <string id="106091" soundid="161864">[Success] Yes... I probably will. All right, I&apos;ll try it first.</string>

  <string id="106094" soundid="161867">[Success] All right, all right. There&apos;s no need to get that way. I&apos;ll try it first.</string>
  <string id="106095" soundid="161868">Well, here goes.</string>
  <string id="106096" soundid="161869">Well, that wasn&apos;t so bad... definitely different. I... I can see why... why someone... might... oh, oh.</string>
  <string id="106097" soundid="161870">Fair enough, you&apos;ve certainly earned it. Here you go. Now, if you&apos;ll excuse me, I should get back to my creations. Good fortune to you.</string>
  <string id="106098">Servant</string>
  <string id="106099" soundid="161872">Well, you&apos;ve tried two dishes, but not three. Of course, you must try all three in a row to earn your silver back. Are you sure you wouldn&apos;t like one last dish?</string>
  <string id="106100" soundid="161873">Well, two dishes is better than most, but you didn&apos;t eat three. Now, if you&apos;ll excuse me, I&apos;d like to finish these testicles before they get cold and begin to shrink.</string>
  <string id="106101" soundid="161874">Are you sure? You must consume three dishes in a row to get your silver back. Are you sure you wouldn&apos;t like to try one of the dishes?</string>
  <string id="106102" soundid="161875">As you wish. Well, one dish is more than most people will try. Now, if you&apos;ll excuse me, I think I&apos;m going to have some jellied eels.</string>
  <string id="106103" soundid="161876">Oh, so soon? Well, if you must go... then go you must. Come back if you&apos;d like to sample some of my dishes.</string>
  <string id="106104" soundid="161877">Goodbye, then.</string>
  <string id="106105" soundid="161878">Hello again... have you decided to try some of my dishes, after all?</string>
  <string id="106106" soundid="161879">As you wish. Please return if you change your mind.</string>
  <string id="106107" soundid="161880"></string>
  <string id="106108" soundid="161881">Wake up...  wake up. Are you all right? I&apos;m afraid the food must have gotten to you. </string>
  <string id="106109" soundid="161882">[Sigh] Well, perhaps our food is just too potent for anyone not familiar with it. Nevertheless, you gave it a try.</string>
  <string id="106110" soundid="161883">Ahh... hello again. Too bad you couldn&apos;t stomach all the dishes I offered. Would you like to try again? It will of course cost you another 300 silver, ingredients aren&apos;t cheap.</string>
  <string id="106111" soundid="161884">Ha, ha! Right you are. Well, when you&apos;re a master chef, it can be hard to resist your own creations. I am Chai Jin, at your service.</string>
  <string id="106112" soundid="161885">It&apos;s too bad that people outside my home of Shangdang county cannot seem to stomach the delicacies that I prepare. They truly don&apos;t know what they&apos;re missing.</string>
  <string id="106113" soundid="161886">I was recently at the Imperial City, and not one person there could eat so much as two of my dishes. Such weak constitutions, all of them.</string>
  <string id="106114" soundid="161887">The food from my county can have some... unusual effects on people.</string>
  <string id="106115" soundid="161888">Perhaps you could, though I should warn you... the foods from my county can have some... unusual effects on people.</string>
  <string id="106116" soundid="161889">I assure you... I prepare my dishes with mastery and skill unlike any other. Unfortunately, the food from my county can have some... unusual effects on people.</string>
  <string id="106117" soundid="161890">For example, this dish of roasted cow heart sautéed with bile of leopard has a particularly nasty effect on one&apos;s constitution. </string>
  <string id="106118" soundid="161891">Other dishes like my monkey&apos;s brain stew can have a negative effect on the workings of the mind. Still others can deplete one&apos;s spirit.</string>
  <string id="106119" soundid="161892">It can be quite dangerous if you eat too much of one type of food... or if you are particularly weak in certain areas of your character.</string>
  <string id="106120" soundid="161893">You&apos;re a stout one, aren&apos;t you, but let&apos;s make this more interesting. Anyone can eat food, but could you eat three of my dishes do you think?</string>
  <string id="106121" soundid="161894">Remember though, these dishes tend to take a little out of you. I will describe the dishes that affect constitution first, followed by those that affect mind, and then spirit.</string>
  <string id="106122" soundid="161895">Of course, I&apos;ll eat along with you, so you know it&apos;s safe. First we have roasted bear heart, monkey brain stew, or shark spleen soup. It&apos;s fresh shark, mind you.</string>
  <string id="106123" soundid="161896">You survived that well. You must be quite healthy indeed.</string>
  <string id="106124" soundid="161897">Ahh... you have a strong mind I see. Good, good.</string>
  <string id="106125" soundid="161898">Ah, good to see you survived that first dish. Your spirit is indeed strong.</string>
  <string id="106126" soundid="161899">Now, the next three dishes are a bit more potent. Be careful what you choose.</string>
  <string id="106127" soundid="161900">We have pickled haunch of deer served with brown beetle paste, cold eagle eye soup, and jellied eels stuffed with fermented seaweed. Take your pick.</string>
  <string id="106128" soundid="161901">Excellent. Your strength is remarkable.</string>
  <string id="106129" soundid="161902">Your presence of mind is astounding.</string>
  <string id="106130" soundid="161903">You have a stout spirit. Quite remarkable.</string>
  <string id="106131" soundid="161904">And so we move on to the last dishes. These are some of the most notorious recipes in Shangdang county. Choose carefully.</string>
  <string id="106132" soundid="161905">We have boiled ox testicles smothered in a succulent cream sauce, curdled porcupine bladder in clabbered rat&apos;s milk, and raw alligator eggs served in warmed goat&apos;s gall.</string>
  <string id="106133" soundid="161906">Fantastic! Three dishes and you&apos;re still standing. You are the first person outside of Shangdang county to ever consume that much of my cooking.</string>
  <string id="106134" soundid="161907">I couldn&apos;t possibly keep your silver after such an excellent display of digestive fortitude. I will gladly give back your 300 silver... or we could make this interesting.</string>
  <string id="106135">Who are you?</string>
  <string id="106137">I&apos;m sure I can keep my mind focused. Let me try some of the eagle eye soup.</string>
  <string id="106139">They might be hard on my spirit, but the jellied eels sound tasty.</string>
  <string id="106142">I&apos;m feeling healthy. I&apos;ll take two of the testicles please.</string>
  <string id="106143">I&apos;m sure my mind can take it, and I could really go for one of those bladders.</string>
  <string id="106144">I&apos;d like an alligator egg please. My spirit will be fine, I&apos;m sure.</string>
  <string id="106147">Tell me more, I might be interested.</string>
  <string id="106150">How about you try it first, and then I&apos;ll try it?</string>
  <string id="106152">I have a feeling this is going to hurt, but fine, I&apos;ll try it first. Here&apos;s your 300 silver.</string>
  <string id="106155">It depleted every aspect of my being! That&apos;s dangerous stuff.</string>
  <string id="106158">[Lie] It was less painful than the other dishes. You should try it.</string>
  <string id="106160">[Charm] You&apos;re a master at this. I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll be okay.</string>
  <string id="106162">[Intuition] If I try it before you do, you&apos;ll regret it later.</string>
  <string id="106164">[Intimidation] You try it first, or I&apos;m not touching it.</string>
  <string id="106166">I think I&apos;ll just take my money and go then.</string>
  <string id="106171">I&apos;m done. I can&apos;t eat any more.</string>
  <string id="106172">No! I&apos;ve had enough.</string>
  <string id="106173">I think I&apos;m done actually.</string>
  <string id="106174">No. I&apos;m done.</string>
  <string id="106175">I think I&apos;ve changed my mind. I should go, thanks.</string>
  <string id="106176">Sounds interesting, but I think I should be going.</string>
  <string id="106177">I have to go.</string>
  <string id="106178">Yes, I&apos;d like to try some.</string>
  <string id="106179">No, thanks. I should be going.</string>
  <string id="106182">You don&apos;t look like you need much more to eat.</string>
  <string id="106185">Why don&apos;t people like your food?</string>
  <string id="106187">I bet I could eat more than two of your dishes.</string>
  <string id="106189">Maybe you&apos;re just a bad cook.</string>
  <string id="106193">I&apos;ll try your food!</string>
  <string id="106194">I&apos;m not afraid of a little indigestion.</string>
  <string id="106195">Fair enough. Here&apos;s your 300 silver.</string>
  <string id="106197">I&apos;ll test my body&apos;s constitution with the roasted bear heart first.</string>
  <string id="106199">My mind&apos;s up to the task. Give me some of the monkey brain stew.</string>
  <string id="106201">It&apos;s strange that it would affect my spirit, but shark spleen soup sounds good.</string>
  <string id="106204">My body can handle the haunch of deer. Give me that next.</string>

  <string id="106408" soundid="162226">Well, if you want to reach the Imperial City you still need an Inscrutable Power Source for the Marvelous Dragonfly. It&apos;s too far to hop our way there.</string>
  <string id="106409" soundid="162227">Off you go. I&apos;ll start planning some redesigns for the Dragonfly. Maybe... maybe floats made of air bladders. Sheepskin, of course.</string>
  <string id="106410" soundid="162228">Our flight was great fun. Lots of explosions, but what does it mean? I think it&apos;s a clue. I hid something in my head, because I was going to lose my memory... I think.</string>
  <string id="106412" soundid="162230">None, and I am *very* good at remembering things. At least, I think I am. I can&apos;t remember for certain. The map could lead anywhere. So we should let it.</string>
  <string id="106413" soundid="169836">We should speak, you and I.</string>
  <string id="106414" soundid="169837">I would talk with you a moment.</string>
  <string id="106415" soundid="162233">Ah, I&apos;m looking forward to this. Remembering things long forgotten is like getting to open a gift twice!</string>
  <string id="106416" soundid="162234">What... oh, well then, I&apos;ll just think on it while you do... whatever it is you do.</string>
  <string id="106417" soundid="162235">One thing for certain, there was no destination. We ended where we began. The route was the important part! Let me show you what it inspired me to make!</string>
  <string id="106418" soundid="162236">It&apos;s a... well, it&apos;s a... I&apos;m not sure what it is, but it has a lever on it that is begging to be pulled.</string>
  <string id="106419" soundid="169838">When we next have a moment, I want to speak with you.</string>
  <string id="106420" soundid="162238">Here we go.</string>
  <string id="106421" soundid="162239">Eh, what? Don&apos;t think? Sounds good. Here we go!</string>
  <string id="106422" soundid="162240">There&apos;s only one way to find out. Well, there&apos;s probably one or two, but who has time to dig an artillery trench? Here we go.</string>
  <string id="106423" soundid="162241">And... nothing. Right? We&apos;re not dead, I think. That is decidedly disappointing. I was expecting... something. I must still need a part I can&apos;t remember.</string>
  <string id="106424" soundid="162242">I need some time to think, to get my brain straightened out. This is most intriguing... and infuriating. Give me... give me some time.</string>
  <string id="106425">Tell me about yourself. I want to learn more about you.</string>
  <string id="106429">This wind map doesn&apos;t lead to the Imperial City?</string>
  <string id="106431">You have a wind map? Where to?</string>
  <string id="106433">All right. Let&apos;s go.</string>
  <string id="106436">No, I&apos;m not interested in flying right now.</string>
  <string id="106437">What do you think about our current situation?</string>
  <string id="106440">That&apos;s all for now.</string>
  <string id="106442">Do you have any idea where this wind map leads?</string>
  <string id="106445">All right, let&apos;s go.</string>
  <string id="106447">I don&apos;t want to follow the map right now.</string>
  <string id="106450">Okay, that should be interesting.</string>
  <string id="106452">Wait! No! I don&apos;t think that&apos;s a good idea.</string>
  <string id="106454">Are you sure this is safe?</string>
  <string id="106457">Exit to Inner Courtyard</string>
  <string id="106544" soundid="162362">Good, good. My beautiful Dragonfly will finally get a real test. Let&apos;s hope those modifications hold up.</string>
  <string id="106545" soundid="162363">Ha! Marvels! You do have it! I truly wondered if my... or your, Dragonfly would ever soar in the distant heavens. I&apos;ll make the changes immediately.</string>
  <string id="106547" soundid="162365">That&apos;s it... you have everything you need. Just let me know when you want to go, and we&apos;ll set the Marvelous Dragonfly to flight!</string>

  <string id="106894" soundid="163426">I gave you to a young monk. I bade him retrieve the amulet from the temple and flee the battle, so you would live to one day reclaim your heritage.</string>
  <string id="106895" soundid="163427">I tried to hold the attackers at bay. Prince Kin, the Emperor&apos;s youngest brother, attacked me, but I disarmed him.</string>
  <string id="106896" soundid="163428">And then Sun Li, your Master Li, cut me down from behind.</string>
  <string id="106897" soundid="163429">The Emperor ascended unopposed, but already Sun Li and Prince Kin plotted against him. The Glorious Strategist was not content to watch his brother come to power.</string>
  <string id="106898" soundid="163430">Emperor Sun Hai, ruler of the Jade Empire, stepped beyond his station and slew the Water Dragon... claiming her power for his own.</string>
  <string id="106899" soundid="163431">His brothers tried to strike him down, but they could not know he would be so strong. Infused with the Water Dragon&apos;s power, he was now unbelievably powerful.</string>
  <string id="106900" soundid="163432">Sun Li escaped with his life, but he left his brother, Prince Kin, to suffer the Emperor&apos;s terrible vengeance.</string>
  <string id="106901" soundid="163433">Sun Li had failed, but he was not done. A Spirit Monk child still lived. If you and the amulet were the key to defeating his brother, he might still claim that power.</string>

  <string id="106907" soundid="163439">He trained you to be an instrument of vengeance, an agent to succeed where he and Prince Kin had failed. But with your death, the Emperor is now invincible.</string>
  <string id="106908" soundid="163440">Then the Glorious Strategist has won. You were the last of the Spirit Monks, but now you are just a ghost, like the rest of us. No one is left to oppose Sun Li.</string>

  <string id="106910" soundid="163442">So, there is still hope. She must have regained some of her power when the Emperor died. But she will remain weak until the fountains are purified.</string>
  <string id="106911" soundid="163443">I worried that our last hope had died with you. But now I see. You have come to restore the fountains of Dirge... the first step in restoring the Water Dragon herself!</string>

  <string id="106913" soundid="163445">You forget that you are a ghost yourself. In any case, I serve the Water Dragon. You must succeed for her sake, so I will help you... whether you wish it or not.</string>
  <string id="106914" soundid="163446">There are foul things in Dirge: demons and corrupted spirits guard the fountains. I am not strong enough to defeat them myself, but I will aid you against them.</string>

  <string id="106944">I see why he is called the Glorious Strategist. Now he has a god&apos;s power.</string>
  <string id="106945" soundid="163546">With that in mind, I give you... a copy of the Duchess of Ulmsbottom&apos;s Rules of Engagement. I&apos;m sure it will sharpen you up even more than you are.</string>
  <string id="106946" soundid="163547">You lot are always on about your spirit. Well, we have a saying: to balance the soul, equalize pressure. I will share knowledge of trepanation!</string>
  <string id="106947" soundid="163548">The skull is the soul&apos;s prison. Drill to set it free. Not too deep, mind you. If there&apos;s more on the bore than in the skull you&apos;ll cut your vocabulary in short order.</string>
  <string id="106948" soundid="163549">Here, a bauble I found with a nice weight. It was wasted on some roadside bidet. The locals acted as though I&apos;d relieved myself on a bleedin&apos; shrine to all of creation.</string>
  <string id="106949" soundid="163550">I just don&apos;t understand this place.</string>
  <string id="106956" soundid="163559">I have waited here many years for the arrival of one special fighter. Your master, Sun Li, bid me to wait until you, his protégé, came seeking information.</string>
  <string id="106957" soundid="163560">The Glorious Strategist was certain the path to the Imperial City would bring you here. He was also very specific about how I present my information to you. You must be ready.</string>
  <string id="106958">This technique has both a negative and a positive effect. These effects are permanent. Do you still wish to purchase it?</string>
  <string id="106960" soundid="163563">I served under Sun Li and was one of a few soldiers he trusted enough to contact after Dirge fell. Li knew the events there would have great consequences.</string>
  <string id="106961" soundid="163564">He told me of the weeks-long siege, and how Spirit Monks were slaughtered so his brother could take their temple. It was madness... the Emperor killed the Water Dragon itself!</string>
  <string id="106962" soundid="163565">You had a flyer? You&apos;re right, I doubt he anticipated that. The Glorious Strategist accounts for every possibility within the known conditions. Had you simply flown past....</string>
  <string id="106963" soundid="163566">Well, I... do not want to contemplate that. My time here would have meant little. I served under Sun Li and was trusted enough to be contacted after Dirge fell. </string>
  <string id="106964" soundid="163567">I am charged with finding the protégé of a dear friend. With the river preventing travel, you must be from further out on the borderlands, the direction he said to look.</string>
  <string id="106965" soundid="163568">After seeing you fight, I have no doubt. I fought under his command, I see his teachings in your moves. Sun Li is your master, and you are the one I am to meet.</string>
  <string id="106966" soundid="163569">As Sagacious Zu mentioned, my name is Hui. Tell me, young woman. What is your master&apos;s name?</string>
  <string id="106967" soundid="163570">I choose to believe that my service was valuable and vital. You would have come here eventually. The amulet would draw you, at least.</string>

  <string id="106986">Go back to the second fountain and restore it.</string>
  <string id="106987">The Minion of Suffering is destroyed, but a greater threat awaits you in the temple. The actions of the Emperor and Sun Li allowed something chaotic and alien to enter Dirge. You must use the seal to restore the second fountain before the Water Dragon can restore you.</string>

  <string id="107009" soundid="163624">No! I don&apos;t want to risk it... my mother is the only one I have left. I&apos;d rather die in the tombs than risk my mother&apos;s life.</string>
  <string id="107010">Why don&apos;t I just get rid of Purveyor Shouji for you?</string>
  <string id="107011">Don&apos;t worry. I&apos;ll kill the Purveyor and find your mother.</string>

  <string id="107016" soundid="163633">Eww.</string>
  <string id="107017" soundid="163634">Yes, I am, you great behemoth. Looks like I&apos;m going to need a lot more supplies if I&apos;m supposed to keep you fed.</string>

  <string id="107023" soundid="163644">Heh, sure, whatever. But you know I pay well for my jobs, and I have plenty to sell. If you want what I can offer, you always know where to find me.</string>

  <string id="107025">It&apos;s horrible that you&apos;ve been stealing from the dead!</string>

  <string id="107057" soundid="163678">If I felt the need to prove my ability, he&apos;d be dead. &quot;My kind&quot; does not consider &quot;his kind&quot; at all.</string>

  <string id="107585">Something about this strange poem made it stick in your mind.    

&quot;Configurations guided by the tiger burn bright, as the cauldron bubbles in the night.  
The cogs whirl their graceful dances, but they grow tired unless they drink of the water infused with sulphur.&quot;</string>
  <string id="107586">You found this academic leaflet and kept it. The crux of the argument reads, &quot;To think that any machine could be designed around the principles of starting motion with a tiger, of all things, is to dally with utter madness. As if this were not enough, no machine made by the hands of man can be fueled by iron infused with nickel. The resulting metal, while strong, is inert to reactions. Even application of electrical current and the introduction of chimney smoke into a mechanical cauldron, as proposed, produced no appreciable result.&quot;</string>
  <string id="107587">You found this strange excerpt from a diary; the pages were torn from the book but kept together as if they were an important secret.    

&quot;...in his ravings, my husband talked of madmen with eyes of metal and of a strange island in the skies. His words frightened me, but none more than when he clutched my arm, suddenly lucid. &apos;It&apos;s the tiger,&apos; he said, fever burning in his eyes. &apos;The tiger feeds on the stone of the cow, torn from the bovine&apos;s innards. All but the cogs are watching... waiting and active... waiting for the tiger to feed.&apos; After his recovery, my husband remembered nothing of his journeys or of his ravings, except one....&quot;</string>
  <string id="107588">A note, probably written to the author as a reminder. &quot;It will likely break the machine, but with a pair of flawless rubies, and care to leave the clappers and cauldron out of the process, the tiger might be able to manage a reconfiguration of the user instead of itself. It might be worth investigating after my preliminary studies into flight dynamics are finished. Maybe... insects!&quot;</string>

  <string id="107774">Old Ming&apos;s memory still seems sharp after all these years. He remembered two grasses that would have similar effects in restoring Kia Min to fighting shape for Smiling Mountain&apos;s special contest. He cautioned that you should only use red silk grass, because bearded tongue grass is only a painkiller and not a true cure.</string>
  <string id="107775">Acquire a Red Silk Grass Poultice</string>
  <string id="107776">Merchant Fen Do in the town square likely has the curative red silk grass in stock.</string>

  <string id="107779">Acquire a Bearded Tongue Grass Poultice</string>
  <string id="107780">While it may not be as effective, Merchant Fen Do would likely charge less for a bearded tongue grass poultice. He is at his shop in the town square.</string>
  <string id="107782">You now have a poultice infused with bearded tongue grass. The mixture may not have many curative effects, but it will at least take away the pain. This should be enough to convince Kia Min that she&apos;s able to fight in Smiling Mountain&apos;s special test.</string>
  <string id="107783">Deliver the Poultice to Kia Min</string>
  <string id="107784">Deliver the poultice to Kia Min in the school. </string>
  <string id="107786">Min was quite impressed with the effects of the poultice, and she now feels ready to fight again. If you wish to test yourself against a record level of opponents, she will happily join in Smiling Mountain&apos;s contest.</string>

  <string id="107794">You set a new record by defeating five opponents at the same time. As your reward, Smiling Mountain taught you the training techniques he calls &quot;The Alloyed Body.&quot; Kia Min seems to be fine, thanks to the poultice you had Fen Do mix for her.</string>
  <string id="107795">D: Kia Min hurt badly.</string>
  <string id="107798">You have set a new record by defeating five opponents at the same time. The bearded tongue grass poultice lacked any real curative effect, though, and Kia Min&apos;s wound has torn open, injuring her further. Despite his obvious concern for Kia Min, Smiling Mountain has awarded you a scroll called &quot;The Alloyed Body&quot; outlining his conditioning techniques.</string>

Now that you have read the fully assembled Tome of Release, you know how to perform a ritual that would lift the curse from the spirits of the last few Imperial Army soldiers who still haunt Dirge. 

The ritual must be performed at the shrine dedicated to Mah Tsung the Water&apos;s Source, one of the first Spirit Monks. Elevated to the heavens for his tireless service to the Water Dragon, his influence is said to guide the invoked magic.

The last section you found, however, warns that performing the ritual at a shrine dedicated to a Heavenly Gate Guardian will summon the wrath of one of these beings. The cursed souls affected by such a ritual would be forever torn from the Wheel of Life. Their spiritual energies would be scattered to the winds, and might even affect the monk performing the ritual in some dark way.</string>
  <string id="107829">
An ancient text penned by some of the first Spirit Monks, this book has taught you how to properly focus upon the Mantra of Inspiration.

&quot;Understanding the totality of being is the only goal worth achieving, and yet it is a goal that cannot be fulfilled in any life. Still, in the striving can be found deep inspirations, and those can aid you in your search. In this paradox, the never-ending journey is made possible. 

Think upon what you have read here, and take your lessons to the meditation wheels of Divine Harmony in the temple&apos;s hallway. They will help you to find the next step upon the unending path.&quot;</string>
  <string id="107830">
There is something disturbing in the air tonight. I cannot be sure of my suspicions, but I wonder at the behavior of some of the younger monks. They seem nervous, like something is about to happen. Not long ago I spotted one of them leaving the well room off the temple, and when I asked why she was down there she could produce no reason that satisfied my fears. The look she gave me when I assigned her extra chores as penance for being distracted from her duties chilled my heart; it was filled with such menace.

Could some of the younger acolytes have discovered the secret path at the bottom of the well? Are they leaving our monastery without my permission? To what end? Troubling questions that will have to wait until tomorrow to answer.</string>
  <string id="107831">Whatever mysteries this ancient text once contained, they have been worn away by the ravages of time.</string>
  <string id="107832">Pages from the Tome of Release (1/5)</string>
  <string id="107838">A Mysterious Token</string>
  <string id="107839">There must be some explanation for the token in your possession. Perhaps the lion symbol is a clue.</string>
  <string id="107840">Behind Master Li&apos;s house, you stumbled across a small shrine dedicated to the last master of the school. When you inserted a silver coin into the collection bowl, a small token depicting a lion detached from the shrine. While its purpose remains a mystery, you kept the token.</string>
  <string id="107841">A large statue dominates one of the rooms in Master Li&apos;s house, likely an artifact left behind by previous masters. It seems to be a test of some kind. Given that the statue is in the shape of a lion, you wonder if the lion token you have in your possession is in some way related.</string>
  <string id="107842">An Ancient Test</string>
  <string id="107843">The lion statue in Master Li&apos;s house seems to be a test of reasoning of some kind. Master Li has never used it for training, but it likely still functions, if you wish to uncover its mysteries.</string>
  <string id="107846">Shatter Altar</string>
  <string id="107849">With a single mighty blow, you destroyed the altar in front of the Lion Statue. Inside, you found a collection of silver coins. You are finished with the statue.</string>
  <string id="107850">Token and complete</string>
  <string id="107853">After finding the old master&apos;s token and placing it in the lion statue, the test changed. You managed to solve this new challenge, earning a reward clearly intended for students who explored their surroundings.</string>
  <string id="107854">Playing by New Rules</string>
  <string id="107855">Whatever has changed in the statue, it still seems to function, leaving you with a mystery that begs to be solved.</string>
  <string id="107856">The lion statue in Master Li&apos;s house is clearly a test of some kind, and it seems that placing the lion token into its mouth has changed the rules in some way. Perhaps this has also changed the rewards.</string>
  <string id="107858">Your earliest memories are of the town of Two Rivers, the school you call your home, and of Master Li, the man who raised and trained you from birth. Now, as your lessons draw to a close, you can only wonder what the future has in store.</string>
  <string id="107859">A Master&apos;s Teachings</string>
  <string id="107860">Speak with Minister Sheng</string>
  <string id="107861">Minister Sheng may have some insight into the pirates and where they acquired their flyers. Speak to him in the center of town.</string>
  <string id="107864">Find a Power Source for Kang</string>
  <string id="107865">Search the ruins for the Inscrutable Power Source and bring it back to Kang.</string>
  <string id="107866">You&apos;ve acquired the Marvelous Dragonfly, but the flyer won&apos;t reach the Imperial City without an Inscrutable Power Source. Kang mentioned that the Lotus Assassins were using one in the ruins near Tien&apos;s Landing. If you bring it back to him, he can install it in the Dragonfly.</string>
  <string id="107868">Find Ru the Boatswain</string>
  <string id="107869">Ru normally spends his time in the teahouse. Seek him out.</string>
  <string id="107870">The pirates nearby are known to have flyers, but the only man foolish enough to risk traveling to their lair is Ru the Boatswain, the town drunk. You&apos;ll have to find some way to convince him to take you.</string>
  <string id="107872">Explore the Pirate Lair</string>
  <string id="107873">Explore the pirate lair to find a new flyer.</string>
  <string id="107874">Ru the Boatswain has agreed to transport you back and forth between the pirates&apos; island and the docks of Tien&apos;s Landing until you replace your crashed flyer. The pirates that hold the flyers may not be quite so helpful.</string>
  <string id="107876">A young woman named Lan has asked you to help her fiancé, a baker named Bei. Every day he gets beaten up by thugs down by the pier. Understandably, she wants someone to do something about it.</string>
  <string id="107877">The Beaten Baker</string>
  <string id="107878">Investigate Baker Bei</string>
  <string id="107879">Bei is usually down at Beggar&apos;s Pier in the southeast section of Tien&apos;s Landing.</string>
  <string id="107882">Talk to Ai Ling</string>
  <string id="107883">Ai Ling is in the boathouse of the docks district.</string>
  <string id="107884">Baker Bei told you that Ai Ling ordered the beatings. He wants you to convince her to leave him alone, and he suggested that you speak to her at the boathouse, the headquarters of her gang.</string>
  <string id="107886">Talk to Bei</string>
  <string id="107887">You could talk to Bei again and give him a chance to tell his side of the story.</string>
  <string id="107888">Ai Ling told you the only reason her thugs are picking on Bei is because he promised to marry her and then went back on his word. Considering Ai Ling&apos;s reputation, you should at least give Bei a chance to explain his side of things.</string>
  <string id="107890">Talk to Lan</string>
  <string id="107891">You could tell Lan that Bei promised to marry another woman... though she probably wouldn&apos;t take it well.</string>
  <string id="107894">Talk to Bei</string>
  <string id="107895">Bei deserves to know that his fiancée has called off the wedding.</string>
  <string id="107896">You told Lan about Bei promising to marry Ai Ling, and she didn&apos;t take the news well.</string>
  <string id="107897">Bei&apos;s proposal to Ai Ling was a harmless childhood promise, not that it matters now. Because of your actions, Lan has run off, and Bei&apos;s wedding is cancelled.</string>
  <string id="107898">Talk to Lan</string>
  <string id="107900">Ai Ling is dead, and Bei can now go about his business without fear of reprisal. You should let Lan know that Bei will be safe.</string>
  <string id="107901">Lan was a bit surprised when you told her Ai Ling was dead, but she was relieved to know that Bei was safe. Maybe the two of them will have a long and happy life.</string>
  <string id="107902">Everybody Dies</string>
  <string id="107905">Ai Ling killed Lan and Bei and then tried to kill you. Sometimes things just have to end this way.</string>
  <string id="107906">Bei and Lan Live Happily Ever After</string>
  <string id="107909">You were able to make Ai Ling see reason, and she agreed to leave Bei and Lan alone. Hopefully they&apos;ll have a long and happy life.</string>
  <string id="107910">Talk to Ai Ling</string>
  <string id="107911">You and Bei should go talk to Ai Ling and straighten everything out.</string>
  <string id="107912">Bei claims he never proposed to Ai Ling. One of them is lying, and the only way to solve this problem is by getting them both together.</string>
  <string id="107914">Ai Ling is Dead</string>
  <string id="107915">Ai Ling is dead.</string>
  <string id="107917">Ai Ling is dead, and Bei can now go about his business without fear of reprisal. You should let Lan know that Bei will be safe.</string>
  <string id="107918">Fighting Pit</string>

  <string id="107928">These bombers are heading for Two Rivers.</string>
  <string id="107929">This is a weapon powerup - fly into it!</string>
  <string id="107937">The dam is closed, and the river is rising again. The town of Tien&apos;s Landing is saved, at least from their trade concerns.</string>
  <string id="107938">The dam is closed, and the river is rising again. The town of Tien&apos;s Landing is saved, though Minister Sheng seems determined to take credit for your actions.</string>
  <string id="107939">Hui the Brave is a trusted and very loyal servant of Master Li. Upon his order, she has waited many years in Tien&apos;s Landing, preparing for your arrival. She seems eager to share what she knows, having waited so long for this moment.</string>
  <string id="107940">Hui the Brave</string>
  <string id="107941" soundid="164799">Go on, teach those bandits some manners!</string>
  <string id="107942" soundid="164800"></string>
  <string id="107943">What do you know about the Great Wheel or the Celestial Bureaucracy?</string>
  <string id="107944" soundid="164802"></string>
  <string id="107948">Acquire Your Weapon</string>
  <string id="107949">Gujin, the weapon master for your school, has a workshop north of the town square. Its location is marked on your map. You should go there and pick up a weapon to help against the bandits.</string>
  <string id="107950">The bandit threat is clearly very real; two of them have already made their way to the town square. You dealt with them, but that was only a small group. It&apos;s all the more imperative that you arm yourself before the main group arrives.</string>
  <string id="107952">Stop the Bandit Attack</string>
  <string id="107953">The bandits are all over town, but their main force has landed on the beach. Take the east gate from the main square and drive these marauders out of your home.</string>
  <string id="107954">Not long after you acquired your weapon, word arrived that the bandits&apos; main force had arrived on the beach. Master Li hasn&apos;t returned, so it falls to you to help defend the town.</string>
  <string id="107956">Return to Master Li</string>
  <string id="107957">Master Li asked to speak with you back at the school, but you have time to explore the town first.</string>
  <string id="107958">The bandits have been driven back, but their leader seemed to recognize Master Li. That recognition leaves you with many questions that only Master Li seems able to answer.</string>
  <string id="107960">Answer Gao&apos;s Challenge</string>
  <string id="107961">Gao the Lesser challenged you to single combat for the right to enter the cave beneath the school. Master Li has allowed the challenge, so facing Gao is inevitable.</string>
  <string id="107962">Master Li seemed ready to accelerate your training in light of the bandit attack, but Gao the Lesser refused to let the matter of your progress go without comment.</string>
  <string id="107964">Learn More from Master Li</string>
  <string id="107965">Master Li has asked to speak with you in his house when you are ready for your final test.</string>
  <string id="107966">You have successfully defeated Gao the Lesser, but in his pride he attacked you with a forbidden magical style.</string>
  <string id="107968">Explore the Spirit Cave</string>
  <string id="107969">Master Li asked you to explore the cave beneath the school, promising that it would make things clear.</string>
  <string id="107970">Your discussion with Master Li revealed many things: his relationship to the Emperor, your orphaning and subsequent rescue at his hands, and the truth about the restless dead. It is a lot to digest, but a mysterious cave under the school might hold answers.</string>
  <string id="107972">Exit the Spirit Cave</string>
  <string id="107973">The vortex of magical energy seems the only way out of the cave. You hope it will take you back to Master Li.</string>
  <string id="107974">After acquiring the artifact called the Dragon Amulet, you encountered several ghosts, including a mysterious female spirit who spoke in riddles. She claimed you were &quot;the last Spirit Monk,&quot; but she explained no more.</string>
  <string id="107975">After returning from the spirit cave, Master Li explained that your people, the Spirit Monks, were warriors who revered the Water Dragon. This connection led to their destruction at the hands of the Emperor, who sought to force the Water Dragon to end the Long Drought. You were the only survivor.</string>
  <string id="107976">Find Dawn Star</string>
  <string id="107977">Master Li suggested that Gao may have taken Dawn Star to the marshes outside the school. Make your way toward the town gate.</string>
  <string id="107980">Find Dawn Star</string>
  <string id="107981">It seems clear that Gao is involved in Dawn Star&apos;s disappearance. He was last spotted heading for the town gate.</string>
  <string id="107982">You have found student Si Pat murdered at the gate into town. Eyewitnesses place the blame on Gao the Lesser, who was also dragging something heavy in a sack as he went.</string>
  <string id="107984">Pursue Gao to the Marshes</string>
  <string id="107985">Gao is headed for the marshes outside of town. He must be stopped.</string>
  <string id="107986">Gao the Lesser left several men in ambush for you near the town gate. After you dealt with them, Guard Yung confirmed that Gao has already left town.</string>
  <string id="107988">A Camp to the North</string>
  <string id="107989">Head to the camp to the north, and find Dawn Star.</string>
  <string id="107990">A mysterious hermit who calls himself Sagacious Zu reluctantly directed you to a camp of men at the north end of the swamp. It seems likely that Gao took Dawn Star there.</string>
  <string id="107992">Rescue Dawn Star from Gao</string>
  <string id="107993">Track down Gao, and make sure Dawn Star is all right. They&apos;re in a cave at the north end of the marsh.</string>
  <string id="107994">One of Gao&apos;s men in the marsh told you that Dawn Star escaped and led Gao pursued into a cave just north of their encampment.</string>
  <string id="107996">Return to Two Rivers</string>
  <string id="107997">Use Gao&apos;s flyer to return to Two Rivers.</string>
  <string id="107998">Dawn Star is safe, but before he died, Gao made some ominous comments about Two Rivers.</string>
  <string id="107999">A pall of smoke in the distance served as a grim landmark as you made your way back to Two Rivers.</string>
  <string id="108000">Find Survivors</string>
  <string id="108001">There must be someone left who can tell you more about this attack. Make your way toward the school, and look for survivors.</string>
  <string id="108003">You found Jing Woo clinging to life. He told you about warriors with black hands and a leader in armor as dark as night taking Master Li away.</string>
  <string id="108004">Horse Demon</string>
  <string id="108007">It seems you are not the only one hunting a missing person in this swamp. A man named Hing has passionately implored you to rescue his Fen, the &quot;Flower of the Fields,&quot; from bandits.</string>
  <string id="108008">The Flower of the Fields</string>
  <string id="108010">To the swamp</string>
  <string id="108011">Door</string>
  <string id="108018">Spirit Cave</string>
  <string id="108019">Villager&apos;s Chest</string>
  <string id="108031">I can figure this out from here.</string>
  <string id="108035">To the Beach</string>
  <string id="108036">Town Gate</string>
  <string id="108037">You rescued a woman named Sing Wa who introduced you to Fen the Flower of the Fields, who turned out to be an admittedly much-loved water buffalo. Overjoyed, Merchant Hing thanked you profusely while his wife left you with a generous purse of silver for her rescue.</string>
  <string id="108046">I&apos;ll hurt you yet!</string>
  <string id="108047">Your spirit is mine!</string>
  <string id="108048">Join me in death!</string>

  <string id="108062">I will be your doom!</string>
  <string id="108063">None escape me!</string>
  <string id="108064">My style is perfection!</string>
  <string id="108065">Die, maggot!</string>
  <string id="108066">Bow before me!</string>
  <string id="108071">I am restored.</string>
  <string id="108072">Poison won&apos;t stop me.</string>
  <string id="108073">Fear my wrath!</string>
  <string id="108074">Your style has saved you... once.</string>
  <string id="108075">My style is faultless!</string>
  <string id="108076">You will be broken!</string>
  <string id="108077">None will defeat me!</string>

  <string id="108085">My body mends.</string>
  <string id="108086">My blood is acid!</string>
  <string id="108087">Death to all who oppose!</string>
  <string id="108088">How do you resist me?</string>
  <string id="108089">Like leaves, you fall!</string>
  <string id="108090">Your power is mine!</string>
  <string id="108091">I am eternal!</string>
  <string id="108092">None shall pass!</string>
  <string id="108093">Your doom approaches!</string>
  <string id="108094">You are mine!</string>
  <string id="108099">My spirit, restored.</string>
  <string id="108100">Poison is... ineffective.</string>
  <string id="108101">I&apos;ll swallow your soul!</string>
  <string id="108102">Your defence is strong.</string>
  <string id="108103">I will destroy you!</string>
  <string id="108104">The school belongs to me!</string>
  <string id="108105">This ends here!</string>

  <string id="108173">Lost Spirit</string>
  <string id="108176">Cannibals in the Inn</string>
  <string id="108179">The people at the inn seem to want nothing more than the death of the Forest Shadow, the fox spirit who serves as guardian of the Great Southern Forest. They have offered a handsome reward of silver for her death.</string>

  <string id="108182">Script stand</string>
  <string id="108183">Allies or Enemies</string>
  <string id="108184">The cannibals are clearly powerful creatures if they can cloak their appearances with such ease. They would make dangerous enemies, but as flesh-eating monsters, they might be far worse as allies.</string>
  <string id="108185">The Keeper of the Pilgrim&apos;s Rest elected to reveal his true form to you. All of the people in the inn are twisted, flesh-eating cannibals, their forms normally cloaked by the magic of a greater demon they call &quot;the Mother.&quot;</string>
  <string id="108187">D: Keeper Dead</string>
  <string id="108191">D: Left in peace.</string>
  <string id="108194">The cannibals may be corrupted by a greater demon and twisted creatures that feast on the flesh of humans, but they are also generous. You parted on a wary truce with the Keeper and his followers, leaving them to pursue their goals.</string>
  <string id="108195">The Mother</string>
  <string id="108196">The cannibals won&apos;t be truly destroyed until the Mother, the demon that twisted these men into beasts, has been dealt with. She lies in wait in the caves beneath the Pilgrim&apos;s Rest Inn.</string>
  <string id="108197">After the revelation that the people of the Pilgrim&apos;s Rest had been twisted into flesh-eating monsters, you destroyed the Keeper and his followers. From what they said, however, there are far more of these creatures.</string>
  <string id="108198">You fought your way through the caves beneath the Pilgrim&apos;s Rest, eventually reaching the cavern that was home to The Mother. You defeated the disgusting beast and escaped the collapsing caves just in time.</string>
  <string id="108221">You were able to open a portal that leads to her domain. If you can track her down and kill her, the Keeper of the inn will give you a sizeable reward of silver.</string>
  <string id="108223">D: Not Kill</string>
  <string id="108226">Despite the rich reward offered by the Keeper of the Pilgrim&apos;s Rest, you refused to kill the fox, instead finding an ally in the Forest Shadow.</string>
  <string id="108227">D: Kill</string>
  <string id="108231">Track Down the Fox</string>
  <string id="108232">Pursue the Forest Shadow and destroy her.</string>
  <string id="108233">With the Keeper of the Pilgrim&apos;s Rest&apos;s offer of silver in the balance, you have decided to destroy the Forest Shadow. She escaped you, but she cannot have gone far.</string>

  <string id="108293">Seek Out Lord Yun</string>
  <string id="108294">Tien&apos;s Landing sits not far from the edge of the Great Southern Forest. A large gate off the central square begins a path that will take you to the edge of the trees.</string>
  <string id="108295">You have heard tales of a disease affecting the Great Southern Forest, which lies just north of Tien&apos;s Landing. Lord Yun, a noble from the Imperial City, has recently arrived to find a solution. He seeks skilled warriors to aid him.</string>
  <string id="108297">Find Spear Catches Leaf</string>
  <string id="108298">Lord Yun wishes you to meet up with Spear Catches Leaf. You can find him at the temple to a fox spirit known as the Forest Shadow. To reach it, go up the hillside path and take the left fork when the path branches.</string>
  <string id="108299">In return for your help, Lord Yun has offered you a copy of a highly prized wind map that covers the skies between Tien&apos;s Landing and the Imperial City. Impressed with your skills, he has asked that you find a cure for the blight that affects his forest.</string>
  <string id="108301">Restore the Missing Crystal</string>
  <string id="108302">Spear Catches Leaf suspects the people at the inn might know where to find the missing crystal, or even have it. Track down the missing crystal and give it to Spear Catches Leaf.</string>
  <string id="108303">You made your way to the temple of the Forest Shadow and met with Spear Catches Leaf.  Spear Catches Leaf has told you that a missing crystal is key to a ritual he hopes will allow you to meet with the Forest Shadow.</string>
  <string id="108305">D: Help her</string>
  <string id="108309">D: Kill her</string>
  <string id="108313">Destroy the Mother</string>
  <string id="108314">The only way to cure the forest is to destroy the Mother, an ancient demon.</string>
  <string id="108315">The Forest Shadow was able to direct you to the real source of the Great Southern Forest&apos;s corruption: an ancient demon, long trapped by the fox spirit&apos;s magic. If you can destroy this beast, then Lord Yun&apos;s conditions should be satisfied, and his wind map should be yours.</string>
  <string id="108317">Return to Lord Yun</string>
  <string id="108318">Lord Yun promised you a copy of his wind map if you could save his lands. You should go see him and collect your reward.</string>
  <string id="108319">You destroyed the Mother and wiped out most of her cannibal followers in the process. The corruption of the Great Southern Forest should be over, and, in time, the trees should heal.</string>
  <string id="108320">Lord Yun was true to his word, and you have acquired a wind map that will take you to the Imperial City. An ancient demon has been destroyed, and the Great Southern Forest should heal in time under the care of the Forest Shadow.</string>
  <string id="108321">Return to Lord Yun</string>
  <string id="108322">Killing the Forest Shadow should have been enough to convince Lord Yun that your work is done. Go see him and collect the map.</string>
  <string id="108323">The Forest Shadow knew that anyone in the forest would sense her death when it happened. Lord Yun should be aware of your actions, and he will likely be willing to part with his wind map to the Imperial City.</string>
  <string id="108324">Whether the Forest Shadow was actually causing the blight in his lands didn&apos;t seem all that important to Lord Yun. Convinced by her death that something had changed, and assuming that it was for the better, the noble gave you a copy of a wind map to the Imperial City.</string>

  <string id="108334">The Outlander has accepted your challenge to single combat. If you can prove yourself his superior, the Outlander might be convinced to leave, pleasing the Minister of Culture greatly.</string>
  <string id="108335">See the Minister of Culture</string>
  <string id="108336">The Outlander removed, the Minister of Culture will want to reward your efforts. He should be in the Scholars&apos; Garden.</string>
  <string id="108337">For all his conviction, Sir Roderick was unable to best your skills in combat. Admitting your superiority, the Outlander has left the Scholars&apos; Garden.</string>
  <string id="108338">Thanks to your efforts, Sir Roderick has packed up and left the Imperial City. Some semblance of peace has returned to the Scholars&apos; Garden.</string>
  <string id="108339">Totally blew debate</string>

  <string id="108546" soundid="165604">The older tombs have spirits that have festered in their hatred for ages. They are not easily controlled. That is why we use slaves to power the golems now.</string>
  <string id="108547" soundid="165605">As well, the mines are simply not stable. Tombs can collapse, so we take care not to move too many golems at once, to avoid shaking the foundations of the fortress.</string>

  <string id="108555" soundid="165614">Let me explain why I&apos;m here; that should clarify things. You saw with your own eyes that these pirates were collecting slaves, right?</string>
  <string id="108556" soundid="165615">True enough. I have a particular hatred for slavers.</string>
  <string id="108557" soundid="165616">My search led me here, to the lair of Gao the Greater. His men took my daughter, and I meant to even the score.</string>
  <string id="108558" soundid="165617">On my way up here, I stumbled across records that show that this goes beyond Gao. The Lotus Assassins are his primary buyers.</string>

  <string id="108560" soundid="165619">This goes beyond Gao the Greater. I have my vengeance, but how many others have suffered as I have because of the Lotus Assassins?</string>
  <string id="108561" soundid="165620">Do you mean to go further with this? I would join you. Only a fool would oppose the Lotus Assassins, but two fools working together stand a better chance than one.</string>
  <string id="108562" soundid="165621">It will be an honor to join you. Oh, and I stumbled across a little something on my way up here. It&apos;s probably something you need.</string>
  <string id="108563" soundid="165622">Collecting them like bad habits, are you? I hate to be pushy, but I have a right to see this through. You did steal Gao from me, after all.</string>

  <string id="108567">Where have you been?</string>

  <string id="108574">You know I did. Get to the point.</string>
  <string id="108576">Gao the Greater&apos;s providing them with flyers as well.</string>
  <string id="108577">I&apos;ve seen similar evidence.</string>
  <string id="108578">If you&apos;d come with me earlier you&apos;d have seen the connection firsthand.</string>
  <string id="108581">It will be good to have you along.</string>
  <string id="108582">How could you help me?</string>
  <string id="108583">I have enough fools surrounding me already.</string>
  <string id="108602">According to the Rat Demon, the Lotus Assassins are using Dragon Powder fueled rockets to clear a way to the ruins of Tien&apos;s Landing. Find the powder somewhere near their camp and then try to clear the way into the ruins.</string>
  <string id="108605">What thing will disrupt them? What do you mean?</string>
  <string id="108606">To infiltrate the Lotus Assassins you need to impress one of the recruiters. The Inquisitors favor recruits who use their brains and demonstrate cunning.</string>
  <string id="108608">Meet the Recruiter</string>
  <string id="108609">According to Scholar Dongow, the Inquisitor recruiter will meet you at the flyer docks outside the Imperial Arena in the Market District.</string>
  <string id="108610">Scholar Dongow didn&apos;t seem all that surprised when you questioned him about the Inquisitors. He agreed to set up a meeting between you and the recruiter, bringing you one step closer to infiltrating the Lotus Assassin ranks.</string>
  <string id="108611">You met with the Inquisitor recruiter, and he presented you with a test. Minister Sheng is about to give a report of the events in Tien&apos;s Landing to Judge Fang, a corrupt but untouchable senior official of the Ministry of Harmony. You must stop Sheng from delivering that report.</string>
  <string id="108612">Disgrace Sheng</string>
  <string id="108613">Hou suggested swapping the &quot;honor gift&quot; Sheng wants to give Fang with highly insulting turtle eggs. Track down Sheng at the Ministry hostel in the Golden Way.</string>
  <string id="108615">You replaced Sheng&apos;s honor gift with the highly insulting turtle eggs. Mortally offended, Fang refused to hear Minister Sheng&apos;s report. Word of what happened in Tien&apos;s Landing will not reach the Ministry of Harmony.</string>
  <string id="108616">Kill Sheng</string>
  <string id="108617">The Black Whirlwind suggested that you kill Minister Sheng. You can find Sheng at the ministry hostel in the Golden Way.</string>
  <string id="108619">You eliminated Minister Sheng, ensuring that his report would not be delivered to Judge Fang. Word of the Lotus Assassins&apos; activities in Tien&apos;s Landing will never reach the Ministry of Harmony.</string>
  <string id="108620">Kill Fang</string>
  <string id="108621">It was suggested that you should kill Fang. Fang can be found in the Heart of the Empire tavern upstairs of the Imperial Arena.</string>
  <string id="108623">With the help of Gentle Breezes, you eliminated Judge Fang, ensuring that he would never hear Sheng&apos;s report. As per the Inquisitor&apos;s wishes, word of the Lotus Assassins&apos; activities in Tien&apos;s Landing will not reach the Ministry of Harmony.</string>
  <string id="108624">Investigate Fang</string>
  <string id="108625">Dawn Star wants to deal with Judge Fang without any bloodshed. Fang can be found in the upstairs of the Imperial Arena.</string>
  <string id="108627">You met Gentle Breezes, a courtesan in Fang&apos;s employ. With her help, you acquired Judge Fang&apos;s Imperial signet ring, his seal of office. This acquisition opens up a new means of preventing Judge Fang from hearing Sheng&apos;s report.</string>
  <string id="108628">Disgrace Sheng</string>
  <string id="108629">Hou suggested swapping the &quot;honor gift&quot; Sheng wants to give Fang with highly insulting turtle eggs. Track down Sheng at the Ministry hostel in the Golden Way.</string>
  <string id="108631">You replaced Sheng&apos;s honor gift with the highly insulting turtle eggs. Mortally offended, Fang refused to hear Minister Sheng&apos;s report. Word of what happened in Tien&apos;s Landing will not reach the Ministry of Harmony.</string>
  <string id="108632">Kill Sheng</string>
  <string id="108633">The Black Whirlwind suggested that you kill Minister Sheng. You can find Sheng at the ministry hostel in the Golden Way.</string>
  <string id="108635">You eliminated Minister Sheng, ensuring that he would not deliver his report to Judge Fang. Word of the Lotus Assassins&apos; activities in Tien&apos;s Landing will never reach the Ministry of Harmony.</string>
  <string id="108636">Disgrace Fang</string>
  <string id="108637">Use Judge Fang&apos;s ring to ensure that he never hears the report. Speak to him in his private stage in the Imperial Arena&apos;s upper level.</string>
  <string id="108639">Using his signet ring, you convinced Judge Fang to step down from his position as the head of the Ministery of Harmony. This should ensure that Minister Sheng&apos;s report about Two Rivers never reaches the Ministry&apos;s collective ears.</string>
  <string id="108640">Report Back to the Inquisitor</string>
  <string id="108641">The Inquisitor will want to hear of your success. Meet him back at the flyer landing site outside the Imperial City.</string>
  <string id="108651" soundid="165750">I remember one time I was hired by two warring clans. They were going to discuss a peace treaty, and they wanted me to make sure things didn&apos;t get out of hand.</string>
  <string id="108652" soundid="165751">A bunch of fights broke out in the first few days, but after I&apos;d killed a few dozen of their clansmen, they settled down. That&apos;s when things got boring.</string>
  <string id="108653" soundid="165752">The leaders took the next *three* days to talk... and talk. If they hadn&apos;t let me dip into their wine stocks, I might have snapped sooner than I did.</string>
  <string id="108654" soundid="165753">Not really... I just helped things progress a little faster. That&apos;s all.</string>
  <string id="108655" soundid="165754">The clan leaders were agreed on peace except for one thing; Jin Lo, a beautiful clanswoman. Both leaders wanted her, and neither would give her up.</string>
  <string id="108656" soundid="165755">After five days it looked like the peace would fall apart. It looked like the two leaders were about to come to blows over Jin Lo, so I stepped in.</string>
  <string id="108657" soundid="165756">It was my job to stop them from fighting, so I cleaved the wench in two and told them to each take a half. Seemed like a good idea at the time.</string>
  <string id="108658" soundid="165757">It was easy. She was small, and my blades *are* extremely sharp. But it didn&apos;t really help, though.</string>
  <string id="108663">I certainly hope you didn&apos;t interfere with their meeting!</string>
  <string id="108665">Why couldn&apos;t they reach a peaceful agreement?</string>
  <string id="108666">I&apos;m surprised you lasted that long.</string>
  <string id="108669">You&apos;re a brute, Whirlwind! How could you do it?</string>
  <string id="108671">What happened then?</string>
  <string id="108672">Ha! Now that&apos;s thinking, Whirlwind.</string>
  <string id="108673" soundid="165772">You have? Well why haven&apos;t you dealt with the man? We can&apos;t have some confidence man running wild in the streets of the Imperial City.</string>
  <string id="108674" soundid="165773">What more do you need? You found him. Lady Rento said she would be in the Heart of the Empire in the Imperial Arena for a while if you really must know more.</string>
  <string id="108675">Mr. B0b</string>
  <string id="108676" soundid="165775">I have no one to spare, which is precisely why I&apos;ve asked you to collect his bounty for me. Surely you don&apos;t want to give up the reward? Take care of him yourself.</string>
  <string id="108678" soundid="165777">Very well. Just eliminate Yukong quickly. The man might have been tipped off to your investigation.</string>
  <string id="108679">I have found Creative Yukong.</string>
  <string id="108680">I need more information before I can deal with him.</string>
  <string id="108682">Could you send your men to arrest him?</string>
  <string id="108683" soundid="190362">He&apos;s no one to worry yourself about. You&apos;re not important enough to catch his gaze, and if you&apos;re smart, you&apos;ll keep it that way.</string>
  <string id="108684">Let me ask something else.</string>
  <string id="108686" soundid="165785">Let me level with you. I don&apos;t lose fights, and I damn well didn&apos;t expect to lose one in this forest. Then you come along and beat me handily.</string>
  <string id="108687" soundid="165786">Before you say it: no, we didn&apos;t fight to the death, and yes, you would have had a harder time had we taken things that far.</string>
  <string id="108688" soundid="165787">That part doesn&apos;t matter. What does is that I could tell I was going to lose. As far as I&apos;m concerned, you&apos;re the kind of person I could stand beside with pride.</string>
  <string id="108689" soundid="165788">Nah. So long as I&apos;m fighting and drinking--preferably at the same time--I think I can let that part where you&apos;d pay me slide.</string>
  <string id="108693">Are you sure following me won&apos;t interfere with your mercenary lifestyle?</string>
  <string id="108695">I&apos;ll kill you!</string>
  <string id="108696">Die like a dog!</string>
  <string id="108697">You&apos;ll pay!</string>
  <string id="108698">I&apos;ll avenge my son!</string>
  <string id="108699">For my son!</string>
  <string id="108700">Die in agony!</string>
  <string id="108705">I&apos;m healed!</string>
  <string id="108706">I&apos;m poisoned!</string>
  <string id="108707">Vengeance!</string>
  <string id="108708" soundid="165808">I should go now, but... I have to ask in case we never meet again. Where did you study?</string>
  <string id="108709" soundid="165809">He must have been a genius. You fight like no one I&apos;ve seen before.</string>
  <string id="108710" soundid="165810">Watching you fight... I just had to ask. Your technique is like no other I&apos;ve seen before.</string>
  <string id="108711" soundid="165811">I&apos;m sorry, I didn&apos;t mean to overstep the bounds of our relationship. I simply had to ask. Your technique is like nothing I&apos;ve seen before.</string>
  <string id="108712" soundid="165812">I&apos;ve studied the techniques of friends and foes alike.</string>
  <string id="108713" soundid="165813">No one I&apos;ve ever met fights like you do. It&apos;s subtle, but your movements bait your foes into seeing an opening that isn&apos;t there. It&apos;s like a clever trap.</string>
  <string id="108714" soundid="165814">I&apos;m sorry. I&apos;m wasting time neither of us can spare. I&apos;ll get ready and pull the lever when you&apos;re near the door. Good luck with whatever brought you to this place.</string>
  <string id="108715" soundid="165815">My question is, since it&apos;s so clear Gao was connected to the Assassins, could their order have similar associations with the whole slave market?</string>
  <string id="108716" soundid="165816">Of course, I didn&apos;t know about the direct connection at the time, but I did find some tenuous links to Gao the Greater.</string>
  <string id="108717" soundid="165817">We&apos;ll have more time to talk once we see the lay of the land in the city.</string>
  <string id="108718">I trained under Master Li of Two Rivers.</string>
  <string id="108719">Why do you ask?</string>
  <string id="108720">At the same place where I learned to mind my own business.</string>
  <string id="108721">I&apos;ve heard this kind of thing before. What&apos;s so strange about how I fight?</string>
  <string id="108722">It must be a quirk of how I was trained.</string>
  <string id="108723">Perhaps you&apos;ve just never seen a properly trained warrior.</string>
  <string id="108727">We&apos;ve already seen the connection between the two.</string>
  <string id="108733" soundid="166673">It is deep and layered. The lives of people spent in the shadow of the Wall... working, dying, never leaving. All their experiences have left marks upon it.</string>
  <string id="108734" soundid="166674">The stones echo with their passing. Sometimes, I can almost hear their voices....</string>
  <string id="108735" soundid="166675">I... I get hints, but nothing that seems useful. They are visions that are possible, or that have possibly been. They are very strong in the city, but they overlap as well.</string>
  <string id="108736" soundid="166676">It has history... ages of history, and much of it is covered in blood and misery. And not all of that is in the distant past. There are dark currents I cannot see clearly.</string>
  <string id="108737" soundid="166677">The threads of fate are woven in the city. Or will be. Does that make sense? I don&apos;t know any more.</string>
  <string id="108738" soundid="166678">Any spirits that can speak clearly are asking for help themselves. The world is upside down. It seems like there is so much more at stake than just our Master&apos;s safety.</string>
  <string id="108739" soundid="166679">I never said that. After all the time we&apos;ve know each other, you should know me better than that. It&apos;s just... so vivid in the city.</string>
  <string id="108740" soundid="166680">If that is what you want. I thought you would be interested in learning what lies beneath the Empire, but I know our troubles must take precedence.</string>
  <string id="108741" soundid="166681">I won&apos;t bring it up again.</string>
  <string id="108744" soundid="165846">They weren&apos;t too happy with my decision. Everyone turned on me. Of course, they all died, but they gave it a good effort.</string>
  <string id="108745" soundid="165847">I don&apos;t know what they were so upset about. Better a quick death by the sword than the prolonged agony of your heart being ripped from your chest and thrown to the dogs.</string>
  <string id="108751">Store Stock:</string>
  <string id="108759">Sell Price:</string>
  <string id="108761">You won&apos;t beat me!</string>
  <string id="108762" soundid="165868">But it doesn&apos;t matter who your Master is. I could take you to the palace, but Death&apos;s Hand controls what my father hears. He must be discredited for you to succeed.</string>

  <string id="108887">Outlaw</string>
  <string id="108893">Bandit</string>
  <string id="108922" soundid="166099">Enough! You certainly don&apos;t fight like a minion of Death&apos;s Hand. His Lotus Assassins don&apos;t have your imagination.</string>
  <string id="108923" soundid="177719"></string>
  <string id="108926" soundid="166103">I give you this...</string>
  <string id="108930" soundid="166112">Let&apos;s get out of here. Black Whirlwind can look after himself on the way back to Tien&apos;s Landing.</string>
  <string id="108931" soundid="166113">The bun man and I&apos;ll make our way back to Tien&apos;s Landing. If you need my axes or... whatever he does, just call.</string>
  <string id="108932" soundid="166114">Well, I suppose that&apos;s it.</string>
  <string id="108933" soundid="166115">Chai Ka: I hope the Forest Shadow can rest easy now.</string>
  <string id="108934" soundid="166116">I still don&apos;t understand why you had to eliminate the Forest Shadow, but... I&apos;m sure you have your reasons.</string>
  <string id="108935" soundid="166117">I&apos;m glad we came through here. Those beasts had to be destroyed.</string>
  <string id="108936" soundid="166118">On the upside, those rocks are remarkably good at dealing with cannibals. I think they&apos;re pretty much eliminated. The inn&apos;s certainly quiet.</string>
  <string id="108937" soundid="166119">How many people can claim to the death of a fox spirit and a greater demon in the same day? At least you&apos;re thorough.</string>
  <string id="108938" soundid="166120">Cannibal or not, the Keeper still made a richer offer than the fox. I would have done things differently, but you have your reasons, I&apos;m sure.</string>
  <string id="108950">Phoenix Oil</string>
  <string id="108951">A sturdy clay vessel containing a volatile oil that burns at a very high temperature. The shape of the container allows you to pour the contents into the mixing controls in the golem press room with relative safety.</string>
  <string id="108952">Golem Spirit Shard</string>
  <string id="108953">Normally these shards are made from the concentrated spirit of an unfortunate victim of the Lotus Assassins and are used to power golems. This one is made from the chaotic spirit of an ancient Horselord. It will corrupt the Jade Golem for which it is intended.</string>
  <string id="108963" soundid="166150">A good thing, it&apos;s an uncomfortable topic really. It&apos;s not so much that I need anyone&apos;s charity, as I could just use some help around here.</string>
  <string id="108964" soundid="166151">Things could be worse, I suppose! I could be not working at all. Still I envy folks like Baker Bei. He&apos;s got Seamstress Lan to help him when things get busy, lucky dog.</string>
  <string id="108965">That&apos;s enough about your business.</string>
  <string id="108969">Tell me what you know about the Water Dragon.</string>

  <string id="109002">The Gem is Lost</string>
  <string id="109004" soundid="166191">Like many things in my life, it can be traced back to very bad luck on my part. As I mentioned once before, I was a master of the Drunken Master style.</string>
  <string id="109005" soundid="166192">I was the tournament champion in Phoenix Gate when things spun out of control. My need for wine took its toll on my body. There are long periods I don&apos;t even remember.</string>
  <string id="109006" soundid="166193">After one such period, I came to, having lost most of my clothes and all my money. I was destitute, and without the ability to buy more wine... I couldn&apos;t even fight!</string>
  <string id="109007" soundid="166194">Eventually I found work cleaning out creature cages at the local arena. One day I was approached by a man who remembered seeing me fight. He offered to sponsor me.</string>
  <string id="109008" soundid="166195">Just like that I was back in the ring. After climbing my way back to the top of the tournament, my sponsor told me it was time to fulfill my end of the bargain.</string>
  <string id="109009" soundid="166196">Apparently the agreement stipulated that I must marry his niece. If only I had read the agreement more closely, I could still be shoveling... dirt in the creature cages.</string>
  <string id="109010" soundid="166197">Um... no. That is a painful subject, one that brings back difficult memories. Though not for the reasons you might think.</string>
  <string id="109011" soundid="166198">For four long years my bellicose beauty insisted we try... and try... and try again to have a child. It was a most... distressing time.</string>
  <string id="109012" soundid="166199">I was so afraid of her for the first year that I could not... perform. Her screaming and chastising only made it worse. I overcame that problem, but there were others.</string>
  <string id="109013" soundid="166200">My plump plum of a bride is... a good deal larger than me. I could compare my nightly efforts akin to climbing a mountain, if only it had been that easy.</string>
  <string id="109014" soundid="166201">And there was always the fear that she would... roll. I am a small man, my delicate frame was not meant for such pressures.</string>
  <string id="109015" soundid="166202">I once lost all feeling below the waist, which perhaps was a mercy in itself. Of course, we overcame these obstacles and kept trying for four... long... years.</string>
  <string id="109016" soundid="166203">Once she decided we would not be able to conceive a child, her interests declined, thankfully. If we had succeeded, I would not have survived to see a second.</string>
  <string id="109017">Why did you marry your wife if she&apos;s so difficult?</string>
  <string id="109020">Wine is a dangerous companion.</string>
  <string id="109022">What was it you had to do?</string>
  <string id="109023">Do you have any family Hou? Any children?</string>
  <string id="109026">Um... I see. You don&apos;t have to go on if you don&apos;t want to.</string>
  <string id="109029">Okay! I think I&apos;ve heard enough.</string>

  <string id="109049" soundid="166236">Calm down, student. What has you so flustered?</string>
  <string id="109050" soundid="166237">The bandits! They&apos;ve already been sighted down by the beach, and they&apos;re making their way toward the town!</string>
  <string id="109051" soundid="166238">Master Li hasn&apos;t returned yet with Kia Min. I&apos;m sure he will be back before long, but we must depend on you until he returns.</string>
  <string id="109052" soundid="166239">They&apos;re making their way toward the town now. The few men in the militia weren&apos;t able to stop them.</string>
  <string id="109053" soundid="166240">I...don&apos;t know, but their ship is large. There could be many of them. You have to help, senior student.</string>
  <string id="109054" soundid="166241">If you think that is wise, I will come and do what I can!</string>
  <string id="109055" soundid="166242">I&apos;m sorry, my friend, but Student Si Pat isn&apos;t ready to face real combat. He has only just arrived. He has a big heart, but that is not enough for bandits.</string>
  <string id="109056" soundid="166243">Go to the school. Seal the gates. We will deal with this.</string>
  <string id="109057" soundid="166244">Yes, Dawn Star. I&apos;ll go now. Those gates will stay closed on my watch, you can count on it!</string>
  <string id="109058" soundid="166245">I will run to the school and seal the gates.</string>
  <string id="109059" soundid="166246">Make your way to the beach and teach these bandits a lesson! I know you can.</string>
  <string id="109060" soundid="166247">You&apos;ve done well, lad. Go back to the school now. Your friends have some new weapons they&apos;re dying to try out, I&apos;m sure.</string>

Resonance: Stronger When Wielded by a Follower of the Way of the Closed Fist
Drains Chi
This style&apos;s Power Attack can initiate a Harmonic Combo that produces a Focus power-up.

Warriors proficient in Tempest have the winds at their beck and call. Fighters who have faced this style and survived tell tales of blasts of gale-force winds and of powerful whirlwinds that effortlessly sent them flying away from the Tempest master himself. Many practitioners of Tempest face entire gangs without ever taking a wound, as the mighty winds at their command keep their foes at bay. Warriors with the chill of the wind in their hearts find Tempest far easier to command, so it is a favored style of the Way of the Closed Fist.</string>

  <string id="110482" soundid="168460">Ah, the Valley of the Sprightly Stones. It is truly a marvel. Discovered many centuries ago by explorers who saw the floating stones from some way off.</string>
  <string id="110483" soundid="168461">Eventually, people came from around the Empire to marvel at the strange occurrence. It wasn&apos;t until Emperor Yu Baosi that the stones were used to build.</string>

  <string id="110884" soundid="168919">Finally! Someone stronger than these cowed peasants. This town disgusts me. I am Scholar Six Heavens, and I need someone who possesses great strength and skill.</string>
  <string id="110887" soundid="168922">Have you managed to retrieve the bridge from the Zither of Discord? It is somewhere in the Great Southern Forest. Just follow the north gate, near the center of town.</string>
  <string id="110889" soundid="168924">You&apos;re back? I wait to hear of your success.</string>
  <string id="110890" soundid="168925">Do you? Impressive. Give it here.</string>
  <string id="110891" soundid="168926">This will show those stuffy scholars in the Imperial City that I am serious. People will talk for centuries about this discovery! *My* discovery.</string>
  <string id="110892" soundid="168927">You... what? You met the ghost of the greatest thinker in the Empire and dispersed it? Give me the bridge, then, and take your fool&apos;s reward.</string>
  <string id="110894" soundid="168929">Did he? And you killed him to... protect me?</string>
  <string id="110895" soundid="168930">So it seems. Maybe I misjudged the Way of the Closed Fist. Had you followed its tenets perfectly, I would be dead now.</string>
  <string id="110897" soundid="168932">Here is your reward. I will return to my quarters for some solitude and...reflection. You have my thanks.</string>
  <string id="110898" soundid="168933">The rashness of your actions reveal how little you understand about the Way of the Closed Fist. Regardless, here is the silver I promised you.</string>
  <string id="110900" soundid="168935">Here is the silver I promised you. I should be able to return to the Imperial City in triumph after I spend a few more months here, in seclusion, studying the instrument.</string>
  <string id="110901" soundid="168936">Do not bother me with your minor successess. Completing half a task is completing nothing at all. I need *both* components of the Zither of Discord.</string>
  <string id="110904" soundid="168939">Yes, as I thought. These are the original strings, and the case seems untouched by age. Perfect.</string>
  <string id="110905" soundid="168940">The bridge is missing, as I thought it would be. Since you have proven capable so far, I&apos;d like you to acquire one more part.</string>
  <string id="110907" soundid="168942">Bladed Thesis penned his last work in contemplation of the Great Southern Forest. That is why the pieces are all here around Tien&apos;s Landing. </string>
  <string id="110909" soundid="168944">If we can recover the last part of this zither, the bridge that would lift the strings off the case, then I will double the silver I was going to give you.</string>
  <string id="110910" soundid="168945">You don&apos;t *think* you have time? What sort of answer is that? You do, or you do not.</string>
  <string id="110911" soundid="168946">Good. In his last work, Bladed Thesis wrote of the &quot;final test,&quot; and it taking place where &quot;wood met water and rock.&quot;</string>
  <string id="110914" soundid="168949">Here. This is the silver for your efforts. I will retire to my quarters in this town and study what I have so far.</string>
  <string id="110915" soundid="168950">It is a shame you lacked the drive to see this through.</string>
  <string id="110916" soundid="168951">As I said, I believe it&apos;s in the Great Southern Forest at the spot where Bladed Thesis penned his last work. A place where &quot;wood met water and rock.&quot;</string>
  <string id="110917" soundid="168952">The work talks of a test for followers of his philosophies. I suspect the reward is the final piece to his famous Zither of Discord.</string>
  <string id="110918" soundid="168953">Yes, that&apos;s it! Now I suspect this final test is magical in nature. You should go there and attempt it, as long as you are confident in your understanding of the Way.</string>
  <string id="110919">To Imperial City</string>
  <string id="110920" soundid="168955">From studying the full text, it seems that it would be near a river in the Great Southern Forest. There must be some structure that allowed him to stay there for some time.</string>
  <string id="110923" soundid="168958">I expect the test to measure your conviction to the ideals of the Way of the Closed Fist. Bladed Thesis would not let his instrument fall into anyone else&apos;s hands.</string>
  <string id="110925">Focus Shrine</string>
  <string id="110926" soundid="168961">The strings should be in the army&apos;s outpost tower to the west of Tien&apos;s Landing, just outside the gates to the old ruins. The case rests in Gao the Greater&apos;s pirate lair.</string>
  <string id="110928" soundid="168963">How you reach the pirates&apos; lair is your problem. Perhaps you already know a way, or Minister Sheng may have some insight.</string>
  <string id="110929" soundid="168964">As I said, it was an instrument that belonged to Bladed Thesis, the scholar who first advanced the Way of the Closed Fist as a philosophy.</string>
  <string id="110930" soundid="168965">It is said that he played this instrument before writing some of his greatest works, as if the instrument particularly inspired him.</string>
  <string id="110932" soundid="168967">The basic premise of Bladed Thesis&apos; writings was that one could live life according to a philosophy of strength. If one is too weak to help oneself, one deserves no help.</string>
  <string id="110933" soundid="168968">Some mistook him as encouraging immoral acts or &quot;evil,&quot; but his true argument was that life was a test which could only be passed through struggle.</string>
  <string id="110935" soundid="168970">Evil men act without reason. Followers of the Way act with the intention of encouraging others to become stronger. The action may be the same but the intent differs.</string>
  <string id="110938" soundid="168973">Played from a seated position, the entire instrument is a soundboard with strings that run across its length. Beneath skilled hands, it offers the sound of heaven itself.</string>
  <string id="110940" soundid="168975">The Zither of Discord is as unique as it is ancient, however. It has five strings instead of seven, and each is fashioned from unbreakable silk.</string>
  <string id="110941" soundid="168976">Go to the forest and see if you can find the place I described.</string>
  <string id="110942" soundid="168977">Remember, I need both the case and the strings of the Zither of Discord. Bring them here when you find them.</string>
  <string id="110943" soundid="168978">If you change your mind. I&apos;ll be here.</string>
  <string id="110944" soundid="168979">No! What...?</string>
  <string id="110945" soundid="168980">Mostly, though, I need someone like you, who walks the Way of the Closed Fist. Aid me, and I will see that you are rewarded most generously.</string>
  <string id="110947" soundid="168982">What I do not need, however, is someone who walks the Way of the Open Palm. I can read in every movement that you would protect the weak and coddle the poor.</string>
  <string id="110948" soundid="168983">They must protect themselves! You see? Your every action, and each word, tells me that you are not the person I need.</string>
  <string id="110949" soundid="168984">That is exactly the case. You are not worthy to help me in my task. I need someone who understands that discord, friction, and trial are the true sources of strength.</string>
  <string id="110950" soundid="168985">Amusing. You encourage me to solve my own problems. That is exactly the attitude I need to aid me in my project. If you make your actions match your words, I will reconsider.</string>
  <string id="110951" soundid="168986">If I can see by your actions that you understand the Way of the Closed Fist, I promise to make it worth your while. Otherwise, I will not waste any more time with you.</string>
  <string id="110953" soundid="168988">You? Again?</string>
  <string id="110954" soundid="168989">My offer still stands, if you are interested. I need your help to recover an artifact, and I have silver enough to justify your aid.</string>
  <string id="110955" soundid="168990">I seek the Zither of Discord, an artifact that belonged to Bladed Thesis, the sage who first advanced the Way of the Closed Fist as a philosophy.</string>
  <string id="110958" soundid="168993">The Imperial Army found the strings not too long ago and will soon send them to the Imperial Museum where they&apos;ll rot and be forgotten. I will make far better use of them.</string>
  <string id="110960" soundid="168995">Currently, I believe the army has stored the strings in the outpost tower just outside of Tien&apos;s Landing to the west. It&apos;s near the gates to the old town ruins.</string>
  <string id="110961" soundid="168996">A merchant lord named Gao the Greater recently acquired the case but knows nothing of its import. Up the river lies a pirate stronghold, where Gao was recently seen.</string>
  <string id="110963" soundid="168998">You will have to find a way there if you hope to acquire the case. Perhaps Minister Sheng could suggest a way to reach these pirates. He might even be grateful for your aid.</string>
  <string id="110964" soundid="168999">Bladed Thesis was a genius, and I am a strong adherent of his writings. I also believe there is more to the zither than meets the eye, if it were only to be reassembled.</string>
  <string id="110966" soundid="169001">No. I will not waste time on pleasantries or mindless questions about this muddy cluster of hovels. I need aid, not friends.</string>
  <string id="110967" soundid="169002">I see that you have found an understanding of the Way of the Closed Fist. I still need a skilled warrior&apos;s aid.</string>
  <string id="110968" soundid="169003">I have no time for those who do not understand strength. Return when your actions tell me that you follow the Way of the Closed Fist and perhaps I will consider you.</string>
  <string id="110972">Someone must protect the weak. What&apos;s so wrong about that?</string>
  <string id="110974">You&apos;re saying you need help, but not mine?</string>
  <string id="110976">I don&apos;t need this. Solve your own problem.</string>
  <string id="110980">I&apos;m interested. What do you need done?</string>
  <string id="110982">What&apos;s so important about this instrument?</string>
  <string id="110983">Where would I find the strings?</string>
  <string id="110986">Where would I find the case?</string>
  <string id="110989">Why do you need these items?</string>
  <string id="110991">Could I ask you some other questions before I go?</string>
  <string id="110992">I&apos;ll start looking for them now.</string>
  <string id="110993">How about answering a few questions for me instead?</string>
  <string id="110995">Ghost</string>
  <string id="110997">I have the bridge here. It&apos;s all yours.</string>
  <string id="110999">I have the bridge, but I had to defeat the spirit of Bladed Thesis.</string>
  <string id="111001">You should know that Bladed Thesis planned to kill you.</string>
  <string id="111002">Sometimes you have to protect the weak.</string>
  <string id="111004">Ghost</string>
  <string id="111005">No, I just killed him for fun. But I thought you should know.</string>
  <string id="111007">Here. It&apos;s yours.</string>

  <string id="111011">I found both of the components you were looking for.</string>
  <string id="111012">Ghost</string>
  <string id="111014">What do you need me to do?</string>
  <string id="111019">I don&apos;t think I have time.</string>
  <string id="111020">I&apos;ll do it.</string>
  <string id="111023">I&apos;ll have to pass. Good luck.</string>
  <string id="111025">Forget it. I&apos;m done helping you.</string>
  <string id="111026">It&apos;s time for you to find someone else to help you.</string>
  <string id="111028">Can we go over where you think the instrument&apos;s bridge is, again?</string>
  <string id="111030">There&apos;s a wooden gazebo overlooking a river in the forest.</string>
  <string id="111032">Where is this spot?</string>
  <string id="111035">What was the &quot;test&quot; you mentioned?</string>
  <string id="111038">That&apos;s all I needed to know about finding the bridge.</string>
  <string id="111039">Where should I look for the components?</string>
  <string id="111042">Can I ask you more details about this Zither of Discord?</string>
  <string id="111045">Tell me more about the Way of the Closed Fist.</string>
  <string id="111048">How is that different from our concept of evil?</string>
  <string id="111051">What exactly is a zither?</string>
  <string id="111054">Goodbye.</string>
  <string id="111081">Take this!</string>
  <string id="111082">My style is perfect!</string>
  <string id="111087">I have healed.</string>

The Long Drought stands as one of the worst periods in the Jade Empire&apos;s recent history. Ten years of scorching heat and little rainfall took their toll on even the prodigious reserves of the Empire&apos;s granaries. The sages predicted at least three more devastatingly dry years, while those in the Ministry of Harmony watched the death toll mount into the hundreds of thousands. Then Emperor Sun Hai declared that the drought was over, and somehow it was. Through the Emperor&apos;s divine will, green returned to our parched land, and stability was restored.</string>

A strange weapon from a strange culture, Mirabelle is made of wood and steel and emits thunder and fire. Loud and ungainly (like its previous owner), Mirabelle is nonetheless capable of doing real harm at medium range. Etched with undecipherable symbols from the Outlander&apos;s language, this weapon is a unique (and dangerous) trophy. The power of some enemies is such that fate itself turns away the cold, foreign steel Mirabelle projects.</string>

  <string id="111590" soundid="169792">I&apos;m waiting for you to follow the map we found after using the furnace. I&apos;m sure it will jog my memory and maybe result in a few trinkets for you. Who knows?</string>
  <string id="111591" soundid="169793">Hmm... you know, it is true that I should be able to find what I need here. Let me... let me rummage through what I have stockpiled.</string>
  <string id="111592" soundid="169794">Nothing new to report yet. I need time to consider what parts are missing from the mystery device. Perhaps if I had the resources of the Imperial City at hand....</string>
  <string id="111593" soundid="169795">Sorry, can&apos;t hear you. Fiddling.</string>
  <string id="111594" soundid="169796">Oh, where&apos;d the city go?</string>
  <string id="111595" soundid="169797">Right, right, we will talk later. I&apos;ll just think up some new features for the Dragonfly. Maybe... mole talons for burrowing. Hmm.</string>
  <string id="111596" soundid="169798">Yes, yes, goodbye. Now, back to my Dragonfly. Perhaps the wings should be retractable. For storage and, ah, rolling stops.</string>
  <string id="111597" soundid="169799">Yes, yes. I&apos;ll keep at my plans for the Dragonfly. Perhaps... a sling for carrying oxen. The industry could use some automation.  A dying breed, the ox-carrier.</string>
  <string id="111598" soundid="169800">Certainly, certainly. Always willing to take the Marvelous Dragonfly for a jaunt. Pick your place and we will be there in no time.</string>
  <string id="111599" soundid="169801">Yes, yes, I am eager to return there. It is a masterful array of artful mechanics, despite being a bit overly polished. This Lord Lao, he could use a bit of restraint.</string>
  <string id="111600">I have underestimated you.</string>
  <string id="111602">Let&apos;s talk about you and what your wind map revealed.</string>
  <string id="111603" soundid="171016">I brought two unspoiled gems from our flight to rescue... ah... &quot;me,&quot; in the void. The &quot;Eyes of the Void&quot; or the &quot;Glare of the Jerk that Locked Me Up&quot; or something. Very volatile fuel.</string>
  <string id="111604">I want to go back to my other questions.</string>
  <string id="111605">Let&apos;s go back to my other questions.</string>
  <string id="111606">You have the resources of the Imperial City at your disposal. Think harder.</string>
  <string id="111610">I just need to fly somewhere.</string>
  <string id="111611">Let&apos;s talk about Lord Lao&apos;s Furnace.</string>
  <string id="111612" soundid="171017">So, continue using the furnace as it is, or risk its functions on the most powerful effect it can produce? Well, if I built it, and I guess I did, I&apos;d fix that restriction first.</string>
  <string id="111628" soundid="169865">Captain Sen has you collecting heads for him, does he? Good for you!</string>
  <string id="111629" soundid="169866">A woman did make her way into the Necropolis some time ago. She seemed a bit wild around the eyes, and ignored me when I tried to warn her.</string>
  <string id="111630" soundid="169867">She certainly hasn&apos;t left, so if it was this Fading Moon, you should still be able to find her in there. I&apos;ll make sure she doesn&apos;t slip out behind you.</string>
  <string id="111631" soundid="169868">I have nothing more to say on that subject, and you certainly didn&apos;t hear that rumor from me.</string>
  <string id="111632" soundid="169869">Not the nicest of topics, but go ahead.</string>
  <string id="111633" soundid="169870">You look like a warrior. I&apos;m sure you know that even if you disperse a ghost in combat they reform again eventually. It takes a long time, but it&apos;s inevitable.</string>
  <string id="111634" soundid="169871">Not at all. This is pretty light work, since no one in their right mind would go in the Necropolis.</string>
  <string id="111635">Give me some more details about the problems in the Necropolis.</string>
  <string id="111637">Would it interrupt your duties to talk about the city?</string>
  <string id="111638">That&apos;s enough about the city.</string>
  <string id="111639">Have you seen a woman named Fading Moon? She&apos;s an arsonist.</string>
  <string id="111642" soundid="169889">This is a legend that&apos;s endured over a thousand years. You should venerate it&apos;s legacy, or at least give it a moment&apos;s listen.</string>
  <string id="111643" soundid="169890">The Eternal Companions were a group of warriors that traveled the ancient kingdoms, well before the formation of the Empire.</string>
  <string id="111644" soundid="169891">They were said to be giants, to know styles no one could match, and to always appear to offer their services to a kingdom when times were worst.</string>
  <string id="111645" soundid="169892">The tales are too fantastic to be accurate. Though I&apos;m sure the Black Whirlwind&apos;s tried at least once, no one can actually cleave a mountain in two.</string>
  <string id="111646" soundid="169893">You&apos;d be stunned how much swill it takes to entertain your average peasant. None of the really ancient stories are true.</string>
  <string id="111647" soundid="169894">What made me bring this up was just a simple thought: were these companions real people once? Were they just like us?</string>
  <string id="111648" soundid="169895">Something tells me they were, but not in the way you&apos;d expect. You know how legends tend to grow in the telling? I think they also absorb other tales as they go.</string>
  <string id="111649" soundid="169896">I doubt it. For instance, we have yet to wipe out a rival kingdom. Failing that, I&apos;m a bit shy of twelve feet tall.</string>
  <string id="111650" soundid="169897">I can imagine worse things, but then the old saying goes that it&apos;s better to have people wonder why a monument *wasn&apos;t* built in your honor than have them wonder why it was.</string>
  <string id="111651" soundid="169898">The point is that when things are wrong, people believe that someone will do something about it. Whether we succeed or not, we&apos;re those &quot;someones&quot; right now.</string>
  <string id="111652" soundid="169899">More importantly, you&apos;re the &quot;someone.&quot; You&apos;re the real reason we&apos;re together, and I worry about how much of this rides on your shoulders.</string>
  <string id="111653" soundid="169900">You&apos;re important to me in many ways. I just want you to know that I&apos;ll do anything I can to help. Anything. Just ask.</string>
  <string id="111654" soundid="169901">You&apos;re welcome.</string>
  <string id="111655" soundid="169902">That would be terribly out of character, wouldn&apos;t it? No, no changes are planned on my end.</string>
  <string id="111656" soundid="169903">We&apos;ll talk again soon, I promise. For now, let&apos;s get back to it.</string>
  <string id="111657" soundid="169904">Your desire is my command, or in this case, it isn&apos;t. Something like that anyway. I will admit that I have feelings for you, but I&apos;m sure you noticed.</string>
  <string id="111658" soundid="169905">It&apos;s nothing I won&apos;t get over, give or take thirty years.</string>
  <string id="111659" soundid="169906">I walked into that one, I suppose. I didn&apos;t really expect... well, that&apos;s fine. I&apos;m not sure I had much more to say.</string>
  <string id="111660" soundid="169907">Come on, let&apos;s get back to what we were doing.</string>
  <string id="111661" soundid="169908">What I&apos;m really trying to say is that I know this can&apos;t be easy for you, but I will stand beside you, whatever comes our way.</string>
  <string id="111662" soundid="169909">Of course. It&apos;s the least I can do.</string>
  <string id="111663" soundid="169910">I will do anything I can to help you. I promise.</string>
  <string id="111664" soundid="169911">Maybe we&apos;ll talk again, later, if you&apos;d like. For now, let&apos;s just get back to what we were doing.</string>
  <string id="111665" soundid="169912">Oh, is that so? I recall a few times my blades managed to take a few of our foes out of your way.</string>
  <string id="111666" soundid="169913">It doesn&apos;t matter, just so long as they fall, right? Let&apos;s carry on. I&apos;m sorry to talk your ear off.</string>
  <string id="111667" soundid="169914">What I&apos;m really trying to say is that we&apos;re all with you until this thing is finished. I just hope you can draw some strength from that.</string>
  <string id="111668" soundid="169915">Anytime. I hate to wax morbid, but this is serious business.</string>
  <string id="111669" soundid="169916">Agreed. There&apos;s much to do.</string>
  <string id="111670" soundid="169917">Things will only get tougher from here on out. Whether you think you need us or not, we&apos;ll be there.</string>
  <string id="111671" soundid="169918">Now, shouldn&apos;t you be talking to Dawn Star instead of me? I&apos;ve seen the way that girl looks at you, and she deserves a little attention.</string>
  <string id="111672" soundid="169919">Now, shouldn&apos;t you be talking to Her Highness instead of me? She has more than a passing interest in you, if you ask me.</string>
  <string id="111673" soundid="169920">Let&apos;s get back to it. As much as I appreciate your company, there&apos;s some big things ahead of us and you have... others who deserve your attention more than I do.</string>
  <string id="111674" soundid="169921">Right. I&apos;ll try to guard my tongue from here on out. I wouldn&apos;t want to distract you.</string>
  <string id="111675" soundid="169922">Please accept my apologies. It won&apos;t happen again.</string>
  <string id="111676" soundid="171018">The rules of inspiration defy such logic. That is why a single flyer is greater than many, and duplicates devalue the whole. The furnace is what it is.</string>
  <string id="111677">I can&apos;t say I have. What brought it to mind?</string>
  <string id="111678">I&apos;m looking forward to seeing where this is heading.</string>
  <string id="111679" soundid="171019">I&apos;ll make something better, but adjusting this one will require monumental effort. It is not designed for adjustment.</string>
  <string id="111680">You really think I want to hear a story about ageless courtesans?</string>
  <string id="111682">I don&apos;t have time for some story you heard as a child.</string>
  <string id="111683">What&apos;s this legend about?</string>
  <string id="111685">Were these warriors real?</string>
  <string id="111687">What made you think of these companions?</string>
  <string id="111688">Sounds like a load of swill to entertain the peasants.</string>
  <string id="111691">You think what we&apos;re doing is just another version of the tale?</string>
  <string id="111693">You&apos;re taking this awfully seriously.</string>
  <string id="111694">When we succeed, no one will lump us in with some ridiculous fantasy.</string>
  <string id="111698">Thank you, Sky.</string>
  <string id="111700">You&apos;ve been there when I&apos;ve needed you thus far. Were you planning on a change?</string>
  <string id="111702">What if I asked you to just be my friend and nothing more?</string>
  <string id="111705">Great. Let&apos;s start with, &quot;stop talking to me.&quot;</string>
  <string id="111707">Thank you, Sky.</string>
  <string id="111709">What if I want more than just your support?</string>
  <string id="111711">It&apos;s not like I actually need your help.</string>
  <string id="111713">Thank you, Sky.</string>
  <string id="111715">We should be going.</string>
  <string id="111717">It&apos;s not like I actually need your help.</string>
  <string id="111719">Then it can wait another thousand. Don&apos;t waste my time, Sky.</string>

Drains Chi
This style&apos;s Power Attack can initiate a Harmonic Combo that produces a Chi power-up.

While many warriors swear by the power of Dire Flame, many others seek to master the powerful Ice Shard. By using their chi to summon forth the soul-chilling cold of the highest mountains, masters of Ice Shard can send daggers of ice flying toward enemies, call a freezing ice storm to slow their shivering foes, or even encase opponents in columns of ice before shattering them with a single blow. Few fighters have the courage to stand up to the cold stare of an Ice Shard master. </string>
  <string id="111972">Taken by warriors to whom power is more important than harmony, Quicksilver is a deadly art that centers on the summoning and control of metal in its most malleable form. Masters of Quicksilver can project shards of metal at enemies, summon metallic blades from the ground, or even transform enemies into metal statues, petrifying them in place. Fighters all over the Empire fear a Quicksilver master who can, with a thought, turn their living bodies into unfeeling metal.</string>
  <string id="111973">Magic Style
Resonance: Stronger When Wielded by a Follower of the Way of the Open Palm
Drains Chi
This style&apos;s Power Attack can initiate a Harmonic Combo.

Fighters who study this style gain mastery over the ponderous element of earth, putting the mighty power of stone and crystal at their command. Masters of Stone Immortal have the ability to attack enemies with crystalline missiles, encase foes in stone, or even open the ground beneath an opponent&apos;s feet. To command the power of earth requires a mind centered on balance, stability, and order, and so Stone Immortal is a favored style among followers of the Way of the Open Palm. It is far less effective if wielded by those who follow the Way of the Closed Fist.</string>
  <string id="111974">Magic Style
Resonance: Stronger When Wielded by a Follower of the Way of the Closed Fist
Drains Chi
This style&apos;s Power Attack can initiate a Harmonic Combo that produces a Focus power-up.

Warriors proficient in Tempest have the winds at their beck and call. Fighters who have faced this style and survived tell tales of blasts of gale-force winds and of powerful whirlwinds that effortlessly sent them flying away from the Tempest master himself. Many practitioners of Tempest face entire gangs without ever taking a wound, as the mighty winds at their command keep their foes at bay. Warriors with the chill of the wind in their hearts find Tempest far easier to command, so it is a favored style of the Way of the Closed Fist, and less effective in the hands of those who follow the Way of the Open Palm.</string>
  <string id="111975">Transformation Style
Removes negative effects (such as slow or paralysis)
Drains Chi

When an eminent sage dies, its spirit sometimes returns as a ghostly red minister. Taking the form of a red minister grants a warrior the nefarious ability to feed on an opponent&apos;s life force and the incorporeal spirit&apos;s immunities to weapons and Support styles. Few people in this troubled age have the resilience to withstand the spine-chilling touch of a red minister. </string>

This style imbues the martial artist with the power and form of the towering Jade Golem.

  <string id="112515" soundid="170804">Lord Lao? He is just a legend. Like saying all millstones are based on his machine that carved the coast for the Great Dragon.</string>
  <string id="112516" soundid="170805">Ha ha ha! Lord Lao? He&apos;s a story for children. Like how he created the air bladders that lifted the palace until the stones forgot they belonged to the earth.</string>
  <string id="112517" soundid="170806">He&apos;s just a legend. Stories of his machines making much-needed lakes and unfortunate mountains are the kind of tale my father loved, but you can&apos;t take them seriously.</string>
  <string id="112518" soundid="170807">That is quite a claim. Lord Lao is just a legend, and so are his fantastical machines.</string>
  <string id="112519" soundid="170808">Chai Ka: Lord Lao, artificer to the Celestial Bureaucracy. A legendary figure among inventors.</string>
  <string id="112520" soundid="170809">Ya Zhen: Lord Lao, yet another face of the Celestial Bureaucracy I can&apos;t stand.</string>
  <string id="112521" soundid="170810">Legendary, mythical, and overrated in some respects, but if anyone else has a better origin for such machines as this, I&apos;m not hearing it.</string>
  <string id="112522" soundid="170811">Artificer to the Celestial Bureaucracy, he creates machines that themselves also create, although I&apos;d make them a little less delicate had I his resources.</string>
  <string id="112523" soundid="170812">Still, he is an inspirational figure for inventors. And we are in his playhouse. You select the machines you want to activate and then the tiger or the dragon button. Like this.</string>
  <string id="112524" soundid="170813">Very true. Perhaps you should give them a try. They didn&apos;t mean much before, but now, we may have the tools to make something of them.</string>
  <string id="112525" soundid="170814">Do as you will. I&apos;ll have another look at these controls. Just let me know if you want to go back to the Imperial City.</string>
  <string id="112526" soundid="170815">Well, ah, if we could puzzle out the function of these devices, they should produce for us whatever they were meant to produce for Lord Lao.</string>
  <string id="112527" soundid="170816">You just select the machines you want to activate and then the tiger or the dragon button. Like this.</string>
  <string id="112528" soundid="170817">Soon, soon, just a flick of a switch, I&apos;m sure. But look around you. Just look at all of... this.</string>
  <string id="112529">Let&apos;s talk about Lord Lao&apos;s Furnace and your latest wind map.</string>
  <string id="112531">But what *is* it?</string>
  <string id="112541">Who is Lord Lao?</string>
  <string id="112543">Wait... didn&apos;t we find a strange set of directions?</string>
  <string id="112544">I&apos;m just going to look around here a bit.</string>
  <string id="112545">I don&apos;t care who they belong to. What use are these machines to me?</string>
  <string id="112547">Enough of your fawning, Kang. Where are we?</string>
  <string id="112549" soundid="171020">Very well, although the palace awaits. Not that I mind a little distraction among the gears.</string>
  <string id="112550" soundid="171021">Yes, we need to discuss what... what was discovered.</string>
  <string id="112551" soundid="171022">Yes, well, it seems the entity holding the memories of Lord Lao is vanquished. The great artificer was imprisoned for insulting heavenly works. Unjustly, I might add.</string>
  <string id="112552" soundid="171023">He is free. He is... somewhat disoriented by the process. Oh, and there is perhaps something else you should be aware of.</string>
  <string id="112553" soundid="171024">Uh, he is me.</string>
  <string id="112554" soundid="171025">You? Lord Lao? Well, I expect there to be more headroom in your flying barrel then.</string>
  <string id="112555" soundid="171026">Kang... what are you saying?</string>
  <string id="112556" soundid="171027">Well, that would explain why your devices seem so unconcerned with our safety.</string>
  <string id="112557" soundid="171028">That is the most laughable thing I have ever heard.</string>
  <string id="112558" soundid="171029">A turn I was not expecting.</string>
  <string id="112559" soundid="171030">Well, how will this complicate matters?</string>
  <string id="112560" soundid="171031">Chai Ka: Such a presence should have been easier to detect.</string>
  <string id="112561" soundid="171032">Ya Zhen: Do not trust his word. What would such a being want here?</string>
  <string id="112562" soundid="171033">I suppose I should have been more concerned with having no memories before the last few decades... or a century. Come to think of it, I guess I&apos;m pretty old.</string>
  <string id="112563" soundid="171034">There was always so much to do. It never seemed to matter where I was from. I&apos;m not even sure what I did to earn this fate.</string>
  <string id="112564" soundid="171035">I must have stepped a little above myself and angered the Celestial Bureaucracy. In the time before their wrath filtered down, I built the furnace to point back to myself.</string>
  <string id="112565" soundid="171036">I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll give them cause. I like it here. So many things to build for so many small problems. All the interesting big scale things are already built.</string>
  <string id="112566" soundid="171037">And, I have an interest in seeing your endeavor through to the end. For curiosity, you understand. And I could possibly improve the yield of the furnace.</string>
  <string id="112567" soundid="171038">I&apos;ll prove it with my understanding of the furnace. It is all I can give you. I&apos;m staying just as I am. So many small things to build. The big celestial things are all done.</string>
  <string id="112568" soundid="171039">Well, I brought something back from our flight. Two unspoiled gems. The &quot;Eyes of the Void&quot; or the &quot;Glare of the Jerk that Locked Me Up&quot; or something. Very volatile fuel.</string>
  <string id="112569" soundid="171040">With my new understanding of the furnace, you now have a configuration unrivaled, but there is risk. Combined with this fuel it may damage the furnace.</string>
  <string id="112570" soundid="171041">It was not so much that the body of Lord Lao was imprisoned, for indeed, he would have no body. It was his memories, my memories that were confined within the void.</string>
  <string id="112571" soundid="171042">I didn&apos;t remember much before a few decades ago... or a century. Hmm, I guess I&apos;m rather old. I still don&apos;t remember what I did to earn this fate. </string>
  <string id="112572" soundid="171043">Yes, I&apos;d like another look. I don&apos;t know why I thought Lord Lao was overrated. Clearly he--and by &quot;he&quot; I mean &quot;I&quot;--understands more than I--and by &quot;I&quot; I mean &quot;me&quot;--could know.</string>
  <string id="112573" soundid="171044">Or something to that effect. I have a bit of a headache.</string>
  <string id="112574" soundid="171045">Hrm, yes, well, there&apos;s not much to talk about now, is there. It would seem I have... not quite remembered all of my own secrets. The furnace remains unusable for now.</string>
  <string id="112575" soundid="171046">Rather embarrassing, really. I&apos;ll make it up to you as soon as I can. I&apos;ve soured on the furnace concept anyway. I&apos;m leaning more towards a forge of some kind.</string>
  <string id="112576" soundid="171047">Perhaps... perhaps some of those golems we have seen could be salvaged to work it. Hmm, or ground up to power it. An enormous golem forge... someone write that down.</string>
  <string id="112577" soundid="171048">Less talking, more doing.</string>
  <string id="112578" soundid="171049">More doing, less talking.</string>
  <string id="112579" soundid="171050">Very well, but this new map is quite an exciting prospect.</string>
  <string id="112580" soundid="171051">I would like to oblige, but this is very important. Besides, the machine seemed to discharge much of its energy. We must release Lord Lao to make further use of it.</string>
  <string id="112581" soundid="171052">A built-in requirement, no doubt. An arrogant decision to ensure his rescue. I would have done it differently, but I have had more time to consider what needs to be done.</string>
  <string id="112582" soundid="171053">I am ready when you are for this very serious endeavor. Imagine it: We are about to embark on an effort to rescue the greatest inventor the Jade Empire has known.</string>
  <string id="112583" soundid="171054">As dated as some of his concepts are, I look forward to meeting him. Perhaps I can suggest some improvements.</string>
  <string id="112584" soundid="171055">Prepare yourself. This route is much stranger than any I have seen before. Clearly we are not bound for a terrestrial location.</string>
  <string id="112585" soundid="171056">I am staying here, just in case. You go teach your Master something about whatever he needs to learn.</string>
  <string id="112586" soundid="171057">Graces and good luck.</string>
  <string id="112587" soundid="171058">Something more than nothing, but slightly less than everything. I don&apos;t know, but you are likely to repeat it unless we find some configurations that are accurate.</string>
  <string id="112588" soundid="171059">What&apos;s that? What&apos;s that? It looks like you&apos;ve found one of the configurations for the furnace. See if you can decipher it and adjust the settings properly.</string>
  <string id="112589" soundid="171060">If we make it back to the real world, speak with me again, and we can head off on that little wind map adventure. Did I say, &quot;if we make it back?&quot; Yes, yes I did.</string>
  <string id="112590" soundid="171061">Well, given the rather fantastic nature of the furnace, I would bet that whoever has them, doesn&apos;t really know what they are for.</string>
  <string id="112591" soundid="171062">The instructions could be a design on a wall, a carving on a piece of art, or even a large scroll proclaiming it is a configuration. People will just have no clue.</string>
  <string id="112592" soundid="171063">You found one previously in an unrelated endeavor. I&apos;m afraid that is just the kind of continued uncertainty we will have to deal with. Keep your eyes open.</string>
  <string id="112593" soundid="171064">Eh? What? Well now, what have we here.</string>
  <string id="112594" soundid="171065">Well, isn&apos;t that just a golden carp full of luck. Let&apos;s see here.</string>
  <string id="112595" soundid="171066">It&apos;s... it&apos;s a wind map. Very sloppy ink, like it was crafted in a hurry, but I can decipher it. It would seem that someone wants to reward proper use of the furnace.</string>
  <string id="112596" soundid="171067">Through some wind, like any other of its kind. Really, I&apos;d think you would have grasped the concept by... oh, you mean specifically.</string>
  <string id="112597" soundid="171068">Like the previous map, there is really only one way to know for certain where it leads, and that is to get in the flyer and go there.</string>
  <string id="112598" soundid="171069">We will have to leave the furnace before we can fly out, however. A little matter of needing the flyer. Just tell me when you want to leave.</string>
  <string id="112599" soundid="171070">Yes, I know you are not fond of action without due preparation, but think of the possibilities. It&apos;s a map, and we could fly somewhere. Ooh.</string>
  <string id="112600" soundid="171071">Well, you are getting to be quite adept at manipulating this machine. If I were Lord Lao, I&apos;d have made it a bit more... obtuse, so people work harder for their supper.</string>
  <string id="112601" soundid="171072">I&apos;m beginning to think you have learned all of the secrets the furnace has to offer.</string>
  <string id="112602" soundid="171073">What? I&apos;m sure it&apos;s nothing.</string>
  <string id="112603" soundid="171074">Well now, it looks like this realm has some teeth after all.</string>
  <string id="112604" soundid="171075">Kang! Are you all right?</string>
  <string id="112605" soundid="171076">No, don&apos;t you go exploding on us. You have the exit key.</string>
  <string id="112606" soundid="171077">I always figured he&apos;d end in some kind of explosion.</string>
  <string id="112607" soundid="171078">For someone with such an affinity for machines, he certainly suffers for it.</string>
  <string id="112608" soundid="171079">You better not be dead, inventor. You have our passage out of here.</string>
  <string id="112609" soundid="171080">Chai Ka: You have someone&apos;s attention, inventor. A blessing and a curse.</string>
  <string id="112610" soundid="171081">Ya Zhen: An attack! Fool, you have gained the attention of something far greater than you.</string>
  <string id="112611" soundid="171082">[Cough]</string>
  <string id="112612" soundid="171083">Well, there&apos;s nothing like mortal danger to jog the memory. Anyone up for a flight to the edge of perception?</string>
  <string id="112613" soundid="171084">The memories, they are seeping in. I see patterns, schematics, explosions. Lots of explosions. And... and someone seeking rescue. Lord Lao.</string>
  <string id="112614" soundid="171085">That&apos;s why the furnace is here, why the configurations are spread across the Empire. When it was safe for his tools to be used, it would be safe for him to return.</string>
  <string id="112615" soundid="171086">Lord Lao is imprisoned... locked away so his inventions could no longer challenge the works of the heavens. It&apos;s an insult to the inventor spirit. We must fly.</string>
  <string id="112616" soundid="171087">How does anyone know anything? Reasoning and inspiration. And a direct assault by energies opposed to the use of the furnace.</string>
  <string id="112617" soundid="171088">I suppose I should be dead, but it&apos;s not the first time. Perhaps I&apos;ve grown resistant to such energetic assault and surprised my assailant with my resilience.</string>
  <string id="112618" soundid="171089">Whatever the case, I have a vision of a new wind map. It goes... nowhere, and everywhere. We have to destroy the force holding Lord Lao in check.</string>
  <string id="112619" soundid="171090">Yes, that would be ideal, although we will quickly move back into a place like this. This route... I don&apos;t think it could be represented on flat paper.</string>
  <string id="112620" soundid="171091">We should go now. I do not think the furnace will function again until this is resolved.</string>
  <string id="112621" soundid="171092">The machine will not function again until this matter is resolved. I am reasonably sure of that. We need to return to the flyer and go from there.</string>
  <string id="112622" soundid="171093">Be prepared. This route... I don&apos;t think it could even be copied down... it weaves between the planes.</string>
  <string id="112623" soundid="171094">I... I don&apos;t know. Yes and no. Who knows what such an assault can trigger.</string>
  <string id="112624">Where did you even get that. We didn&apos;t land.</string>
  <string id="112625">There must be more to it. It can&apos;t be there just for me to play with.</string>
  <string id="112628">Yes, yes, but what is the point?</string>
  <string id="112631">Then why don&apos;t you fix it?</string>
  <string id="112633">Did we succeed? I did not see Lord Lao appear.</string>
  <string id="112637">Well, Kang, how do you explain this?</string>
  <string id="112640">So what now? Will... whoever come back for you?</string>
  <string id="112643">Ridiculous. You offer no proof.</string>
  <string id="112645">Enough! What is the practical application of this?</string>
  <string id="112648">I&apos;ll need more proof than just your foolish word.</string>
  <string id="112649">So... I did all this to rescue a fool I already had?</string>
  <string id="112652">Where is this great inventor? He owes me.</string>
  <string id="112656">Let&apos;s return to my other questions.</string>
  <string id="112657">I want to revisit my other questions.</string>
  <string id="112658">I just want to return to Lord Lao&apos;s Furnace.</string>
  <string id="112661">Let&apos;s go.</string>
  <string id="112662">Goodbye.</string>
  <string id="112664">Where can I find configurations for this device?</string>
  <string id="112666">Kang, something just appeared behind you.</string>
  <string id="112669">Where does it lead?</string>
  <string id="112672">Another wild hunt. Great.</string>
  <string id="112674">Pay attention, Kang! Look!</string>
  <string id="112676">Kang, what is that energy surrounding you?</string>
  <string id="112687">What are you talking about, Kang?</string>
  <string id="112690">How do you know this?</string>
  <string id="112693">I assume we must return to the flyer first?</string>
  <string id="112695">I am not finished here.</string>
  <string id="112697">That&apos;s quite the revelation. You just realized this?</string>
  <string id="112699">Explain yourself.</string>
  <string id="112700">Run, Kang, the machine is acting up again!</string>
  <string id="112701" soundid="171231">I thought to test you, but you need no trial. You are worthy. I grant you the chance to carry out my wishes.</string>
  <string id="112702" soundid="171232">You are blind. Rivers do not course; they tear at the earth like a saw eternally cutting into the land.</string>
  <string id="112703" soundid="171233">You do not deserve your eyes. Trees and moss do not *grow*, they tear sustenance from the earth and drive their roots deep into the rocks to find purchase.</string>
  <string id="112704" soundid="171234">Are you a poet? No! You are a warrior! You forget that I know you.</string>
  <string id="112705" soundid="171235">I do not think you are worthy of the task I meant to put before you.</string>
  <string id="112706" soundid="171236">You have a spine after all! Where do you keep it when it is not in use?</string>
  <string id="112707" soundid="171237">You are intrigued by my power. Ghosts madden over time yet I have not. &quot;Why?&quot; you ask... I will set before you a test. Succeed, and I may grant you the bridge you seek.</string>
  <string id="112709" soundid="171239">Yes! That is what I was seeking. You sense the struggle between the elements. You may yet prove yourself worthy.</string>
  <string id="112710" soundid="171240">Insolence!</string>
  <string id="112711">Tell me about this test again.</string>
  <string id="112712">Use Mouse Wheel, &lt;PreviousTarget&gt;, or &lt;NextTarget&gt; to switch between Upgrades.</string>
  <string id="112713">Push &lt;StrongAttack&gt; when you want to use your selected Upgrade.</string>
  <string id="112714">It would be an honor to serve.</string>
  <string id="112715">There is no honor in serving a dead man. Why should I do anything you ask?</string>
  <string id="112716">You &quot;grant&quot; me nothing. Make an offer, and I will consider it.</string>
  <string id="112717">Your arrogance knows no bounds. I should simply destroy you.</string>
  <string id="112718">Who are you, spirit?</string>
  <string id="112719">Why are you asking me this?</string>
  <string id="112721">Are you the reason this forest is sickened?</string>
  <string id="112723">You&apos;re just another ghost. Time to fall.</string>
  <string id="112726">I see trees tearing and water churning at the rocks, and I see time destroying all this because it is weak.</string>
  <string id="112727">You have found some damning evidence against the Emperor. Return to the flyer so you can determine what must be done next.</string>
  <string id="112729">I see a river, coursing over some rocks.</string>
  <string id="112731">I see trees and moss growing on the rock face.</string>
  <string id="112733">I see nature in its untamed glory.</string>
  <string id="112735">What task is this?</string>
  <string id="112736">You should be careful about whom you offend, ghost.</string>
  <string id="112738">Princess Sun Lian/Silk Fox will take you to the palace where Master Li is secured, but only after she has information to prove to her father that Death&apos;s Hand is a traitor to the Empire.</string>
  <string id="112739">Killing enemies builds up your Chi (blue bar).</string>
  <string id="112740">What is the nature of this test?</string>
  <string id="112741">You need Chi to use your Upgrades.</string>
  <string id="112742">Worthy or not, I&apos;m going to kill you and take the bridge of the zither.</string>
  <string id="112743">I see a channel carved deep by the water.</string>
  <string id="112744">I see a daft old ghost about to be destroyed. I need that instrument&apos;s bridge.</string>
  <string id="112745">Sair</string>
  <string id="112748">Is that all? Am I an errand girl? I&apos;m better than that.</string>
  <string id="112749">Sailor</string>
  <string id="112752">Thug</string>
  <string id="112882">Ancient Coffin</string>
  <string id="112883">Post Collapse Fire</string>
  <string id="112884">Prison Door</string>
  <string id="112886">To the Temple</string>
  <string id="112890">Sailor</string>
  <string id="112895">Sailor</string>
  <string id="112901">I can&apos;t hurt you?!</string>
  <string id="112903">Lost Spirit</string>
  <string id="112906">Lady Fourteen Flowers</string>
  <string id="112907">Doesn&apos;t it hurt?</string>
  <string id="112908">You&apos;re going down!</string>
  <string id="112909">This&apos;ll be the end!</string>
  <string id="112910">You go no farther!</string>
  <string id="112911">You&apos;re gonna die!</string>
  <string id="112912">You won&apos;t know what hit you!</string>
  <string id="112913">Die!</string>
  <string id="112918">That&apos;s better.</string>
  <string id="112919">I don&apos;t feel so good.</string>
  <string id="112920">Take that!</string>
  <string id="112921">It&apos;s no use.</string>
  <string id="112922">By all that&apos;s decent!</string>
  <string id="112923">Die, intruders!</string>
  <string id="112924">For my people!</string>
  <string id="112925">Foul miscreants! </string>
  <string id="112926">I&apos;ll make you pay.</string>
  <string id="112927">Expel the filth!</string>
  <string id="112932">I&apos;m getting better.</string>
  <string id="112933">A blood plague!</string>
  <string id="112934">See your weakness?</string>
  <string id="112935">That didn&apos;t work... but I adapt!</string>
  <string id="112936">This is *my* fight!</string>
  <string id="112937">This is it!</string>
  <string id="112938">I&apos;ll show you!</string>
  <string id="112939">You won&apos;t get up!</string>
  <string id="112940">No more practice!</string>
  <string id="112941">I&apos;ll prove myself!</string>
  <string id="112946">My wounds are healed!</string>
  <string id="112947">That... was a low trick...</string>
  <string id="112948">See my strength!</string>
  <string id="112949">I&apos;ll hurt you yet!</string>
  <string id="112950">Your spirit is mine!</string>
  <string id="112951">Join me in death!</string>
  <string id="112952">Now is your end!</string>
  <string id="112953">Die!</string>

  <string id="113215" soundid="171756">You would hear what I have to say?</string>
  <string id="113216" soundid="171757">Years ago I found my end at the hands of an executioner. His yellow sash, symbolizing his service to the Emperor, was the last thing I saw.</string>
  <string id="113217" soundid="171758">I had tried to rob a store armed with a saber that my husband had used before his death.</string>
  <string id="113218" soundid="171759">I thought to take all the silver the shopkeeper had and leave town with my only child. We would go far away and start over.</string>
  <string id="113219" soundid="171760">The death of my son&apos;s father had left us with nothing, and I would not shame my husband&apos;s memory by begging on the streets.</string>
  <string id="113220" soundid="171761">I claimed my silver without a problem, but the shopkeeper&apos;s son had ducked out the back and ran to tell the guards.</string>
  <string id="113221" soundid="171762">I did not get far before they caught me. I knew the penalty for what I had done, so I fought viciously, but they were too many. I was caught and beheaded.</string>
  <string id="113222" soundid="171763">I do not know what happened to my son, but despite the shame of my beheading, I can rest easy knowing I tried all I could. That is my story.</string>
  <string id="113223" soundid="171764">As you wish.</string>
  <string id="113224">Yes, tell me.</string>
  <string id="113227">How did you die?</string>
  <string id="113228">You clearly weren&apos;t skilled enough with that blade.</string>
  <string id="113232">Could you repeat it for me?</string>
  <string id="113233">That&apos;s all I needed from you.</string>
  <string id="113234">I will hear the rest of your story later.</string>
  <string id="113235">No, not right now.</string>
  <string id="113236" soundid="171777">You wish to hear my tale?</string>
  <string id="113237" soundid="171778">In life I was a bandit. With the help of my men, I attacked many caravans, taking what I needed from the decadent traders.</string>
  <string id="113238" soundid="171779">One day, one of the traders decided to make a stand. He called me out and challenged me to a fight. I accepted.</string>
  <string id="113239" soundid="171780">I toyed with the trader. Drew out the fight for the enjoyment of my men. He fought well enough, but he could not beat me. Eventually, I got tired of playing.</string>
  <string id="113240" soundid="171781">I laid into him, beating him soundly and then backing off. Enjoying his suffering. Then, betrayal!</string>
  <string id="113241" soundid="171782">Realizing I was growing tired and deliberately sloppy, my second in command plunged a dagger into my back. She took it all: my life, my men and my silver.</string>
  <string id="113242" soundid="171783">That is the tale of how I died.</string>
  <string id="113243" soundid="171784">Very well.</string>
  <string id="113244">Yes, tell me.</string>
  <string id="113246">What happened next?</string>
  <string id="113247">You died by the hand of a trader? Some bandit leader you were.</string>
  <string id="113251">Could you repeat it for me?</string>
  <string id="113252">That is all for now.</string>
  <string id="113253">I will hear your story later.</string>
  <string id="113254">No, not right now.</string>
  <string id="113256" soundid="171797">I wish to know if you understand my philosphy. I see potential in you, so perhaps you are worth the effort to teach. If you fail to grasp its basic tenets, I will kill you. </string>
  <string id="113257">Done</string>
  <string id="113258" soundid="171799">You know nothing of my works? The Way of the Closed Fist *gives* nothing. You must take what you seek or earn it. That is the way.</string>
  <string id="113259" soundid="171800">You think to face me? Only the strong shall have the bridge. Pass my test, and I would make you a richer offer than some scholar could. Six Heavens is no secret to me...</string>
  <string id="113261" soundid="171802">Good. Look at these wretches. Each of them has a story. Speak with them and then tell me which one deserved to die. More importantly, tell me why.</string>
  <string id="113263" soundid="171804"></string>
  <string id="113264" soundid="171805">Speak with them both. Do not waste my time again.</string>
  <string id="113265" soundid="171806">You will waste no more of my time. Enough of your insolence.</string>
  <string id="113266" soundid="171807">Then tell me, who deserved their death? The man, or the woman? Do not bother with fabrication, I will hear the truth of what you say.</string>
  <string id="113267" soundid="171808">Now, why?</string>
  <string id="113268" soundid="171809">Listen to yourself. You whimper like a babe denied mothers&apos; milk. There is no fault in preying upon the weak, only in becoming weak yourself.</string>
  <string id="113269" soundid="171810">You understand the Way of the Closed Fist. Taunting a foe, playing with them, teaches them nothing. The other bandit was right to kill him and seize his power.</string>
  <string id="113271" soundid="171812">Honor does not enter into whether his death was deserved. You understand nothing of the Way of the Closed Fist.</string>
  <string id="113272" soundid="171813">He should have killed the merchant quickly. Taunting a foe is self-indulgent cruelty, teaching them nothing. It is true he had to die, but you failed to grasp the reason,</string>
  <string id="113274" soundid="171815">Interesting. Why?</string>
  <string id="113275" soundid="171816">How transparent you reveal your understanding of the Way to be. While she died for her crimes, the woman acted with purpose.</string>
  <string id="113276" soundid="171817">That is your only rationale? I know you listened to the bandit&apos;s tale and yet your mind stalls on something so trivial?</string>
  <string id="113277" soundid="171818">Compare her to the bandit who taunted his foe out of cruelty. She died as a result of an active choice, while he died without purpose. You fail to grasp my teachings.</string>
  <string id="113279" soundid="171820">Interesting. I&apos;d say the bandit deserved death more. But I concur that, had the woman been stronger and faster, she&apos;d have seen success. Your argument is valid.</string>
  <string id="113281" soundid="171822">It is never an honor to serve, but I appreciate the thought. The Zither of Discord is a magical artifact of great power, though it takes a lifetime to master its secrets.</string>
  <string id="113282" soundid="171823">If you wish, you may try. It would be more to your advantage to hear me out, though.</string>
  <string id="113283" soundid="171824">The Zither of Discord is more than an instrument. It is a magical artifact of great power, though it takes a lifetime of study to master its secrets.</string>
  <string id="113284" soundid="171825">Before my death, I performed my greatest composition, preserving me from madness. But the zither was dismantled before I learned how to fully harness its strength.</string>
  <string id="113286" soundid="171827">I do not want you to repair the zither personally. The test was a way to ensure that you understood why Scholar Six Heavens has to be the one to repair the zither.</string>
  <string id="113287" soundid="171828">The process will kill him. I will ensure that the zither&apos;s discord consumes him. In that moment I will seize some of his life force, making myself stronger.</string>
  <string id="113288" soundid="171829">He talks the Way but he never learned to walk it, thinking that merely reciting my name would be enough. See how he relies on your strength rather than his own?</string>
  <string id="113290" soundid="171831">Take the bridge to him, and say nothing. Let him bring his doom upon himself, and I will use the magic of the zither to strengthen you and I both.</string>
  <string id="113291" soundid="171832">I doubt he would believe you. He would find a way to assemble it, with you or without. And when he does, I shall be there to usher in his doom.</string>
  <string id="113293" soundid="171834">So you have a choice. Take the bridge and aid me, and I will strengthen you. Try to disperse me as you do those other ghosts and gain nothing even if you succeed.</string>
  <string id="113294" soundid="171835">The Way of the Closed Fist is a way of strength. If you help me, your act will bring forth more discord, more chaos, and that can be turned to your advantage.</string>
  <string id="113295" soundid="171836">When fully assembled, and properly played, the zither has incredible powers. You must aid me with a clear conscience, or I can not aid you.</string>
  <string id="113297" soundid="171838">Good. Here is the bridge. Take it to Scholar Six Heavens, and teach him the final lesson of the Way of the Closed Fist.</string>
  <string id="113298" soundid="171839">Were he worthy, he would not have sent you in his stead. The pity you show to him marks you as no better. No matter. There will be others. There always are.</string>
  <string id="113301" soundid="171842">You think to cover all possibilities and take the coward&apos;s way out. I will not tolerate such foolishness.</string>
  <string id="113304" soundid="171845">I have not waited hundreds of years to hear that all life is precious and that people should just &quot;get along.&quot; Clearly you understand nothing of my teachings.</string>
  <string id="113305" soundid="171846">Come, I will teach you the final lesson of the Way of the Closed Fist.</string>
  <string id="113306" soundid="171847">The test is simple if you understand the Way of the Closed Fist. Speak with each of these wretches and hear their stories. Tell me which of them deserved to die, and why.</string>
  <string id="113308" soundid="171849">How do you ask such a foolish thing without your face burning with shame? I will not answer your test for you.</string>
  <string id="113309" soundid="171850">My philosophy became known as the Way of the Closed Fist after my time among the living, but the principles are unchanged. It&apos;s a philosophy of both strength and purpose.</string>
  <string id="113311" soundid="171852">Strength is only the beginning of the Way. More important is the purpose behind it. Those who possess strength but lack purpose leave nothing in their wake but random acts.</string>
  <string id="113313" soundid="171854">Purpose is was what separates us from soulless evil. Adversity teaches us strength. Those who learn only weakness from it have neither purpose nor place within the world.</string>
  <string id="113316" soundid="171857">Just the opposite. Cruelty stems from a lack of purpose. We are to be tolerant of suffering only if it has a larger purpose, a coherent goal to justify its existence.</string>
  <string id="113319" soundid="171860">The Way of the Open Palm is an excuse for the weak to be coddled. Even worse, however, are those who choose no path. Without purpose, their lives have no value.</string>
  <string id="113321" soundid="171862">Then that is all you need to know for the test. Think upon what you have learned and, when you are ready, answer which of these spirits deserved their death.</string>
  <string id="113322" soundid="171863">Good. Tests are best attempted, not questioned.</string>
  <string id="113323" soundid="171864">You muddle your mind with questions. Seek a purpose and act; that is all that matters. I will humor you... for now.</string>
  <string id="113324" soundid="171865">Yes, I will.</string>
  <string id="113325" soundid="171866">I will give you the bridge if you prove yourself worthy. It will be an amusement after too many years without such simple pleasures.</string>
  <string id="113326" soundid="171867">You wish to know about me? Or do you wonder at the nature of my kind, the red ministers?</string>
  <string id="113327" soundid="171868">We are ghosts, but ghosts who have kept more of ourselves than most. A red minister is the spirit of a scholar or wizard who has kept himself from the Wheel of Fate.</string>
  <string id="113328" soundid="171869">Many ghosts slip into madness. That is the nature of spirits denied their rest. But I am Bladed Thesis, Master of the Way of the Closed Fist. Madness is not acceptable.</string>
  <string id="113330" soundid="171871">This was where I completed my last work. This very pagoda gave me shelter as I played the Zither of Discord. By remaining here, my death has purpose.</string>
  <string id="113331">Get Your Bearings</string>
  <string id="113332" soundid="171873">Good. I do not matter except in what I can do for you. Remember that. Now are you ready to answer my test?</string>
  <string id="113333" soundid="171874">Go, then. Return when you have an answer.</string>
  <string id="113334" soundid="171875">Such a pathetic fool. You understand nothing.</string>
  <string id="113335" soundid="195403"></string>
  <string id="113336" soundid="171877">To what end? His death brought me power and you knowledge.</string>
  <string id="113339" soundid="171880">Why? You stand to gain nothing from my dispersal.</string>
  <string id="113340" soundid="171881">More and more you surprise me. Your understanding of the Way is impressive; it would almost be an honor to lose to you. It won&apos;t happen, but it would be an honor.</string>
  <string id="113342" soundid="171883">Philosophy is the only way to justify our actions!</string>
  <string id="113343" soundid="171884">And I had such high hopes for you. It seems I will have to teach you your final lesson the hard way.</string>
  <string id="113346">I don&apos;t really care. Just give me the reward you promised.</string>
  <string id="113347">I hope you at least made him suffer.</string>
  <string id="113348" soundid="190469">There.. are... FOUR LIGHTS!</string>
  <string id="113349" soundid="190470">I don&apos;t know. *They* seemed to like it. </string>
  <string id="113350">Save the lecture. I&apos;m going to eliminate you, too.</string>
  <string id="113351">I can rest easy knowing both you and Six Heavens are gone!</string>

  <string id="113368">The man did.</string>
  <string id="113369">He was a bandit who preyed upon the weak. He should have earned his way.</string>
  <string id="113371">He wasted his strength on a display. There was no purpose to toying with the trader.</string>
  <string id="113374">He fought without honor. He should have respected his opponent.</string>
  <string id="113378">The woman deserved her death.</string>
  <string id="113379">She wasted her time caring about her child.</string>
  <string id="113381">She was a criminal, even if the crime was small. She had to be punished.</string>

  <string id="113409">They both deserved their deaths.</string>
  <string id="113412">Neither of them.</string>
  <string id="113416">How will I know which answer is correct?</string>

  <string id="113429">That&apos;s enough about the Way of the Closed Fist.</string>

  <string id="113435">What exactly is a red minister?</string>
  <string id="113436">How is it that you haven&apos;t gone mad like many other spirits?</string>
  <string id="113438">Why are you here in the forest?</string>
  <string id="113440">I know enough about you.</string>
  <string id="113441">I will return when I have made my decision.</string>

  <string id="113443">I&apos;m tired of these games. I will just kill you instead.</string>

The various means of Divination have been around since the beginnings of the Empire. Divination was originally performed by heating bones in a fire. Questions written in blood on the bones could be answered by examining the cracks formed. It was believed that the spirits in question could more readily act through fire on bone, an element of death closely associated with them.

This practice had its faults, and the more modern methods provide much greater accuracy of prediction. Many methods are in use across the Empire, their prevalence rising and falling as the power of the spirits associated with them waxes and wanes. Astronomy, geomancy, and diving upon entrails are all much more cultured and sophisticated methods than bone reading, but old ways are important, since they still offer a more primal connection to nature.</string>
  <string id="113445" soundid="171990">Emotions burn within, but can be coaxed outward as well. Harness this to bring fire to your hands. Yours is the power to unleash Dire Flame. </string>

  <string id="113447">The Land of Howling Spirits</string>
  <string id="113448">
To the west of the Jade Empire proper lies the Land of Howling Spirits, a range of sheer mountains and desolate, haunted passes. Not many men dwell in this harsh land. It does not support much in the way of communities, and those who dwell there are hardy mountainfolk who rely on themselves and their herds of goats more than trust in nature.

There is one exception to this rule. High in the mountains lies a secluded monastery, home to a reclusive and mysterious order known as the Spirit Monks. They tend an unknown charge in their sealed monastery. No one, not even an emperor, has been able to discover what lies within. The monks possess strange powers, but they exist in balance with nature. Eventually that land will be absorbed, and the Empire shall learn its secrets.</string>
  <string id="113449">I choose the flame.</string>
  <string id="113450">The Lotus Monks</string>
  <string id="113451">I will choose the ice.</string>
  <string id="113452">
As far as we know, all copies of the larger text were destroyed, but I shall include a fragment below for your amusement:

&quot;Protection of our glorious Emperor has always been the purpose of the Order of the Lotus. The Lotus Monks are the personal servants and protectors of the Emperor of the Jade Empire, governed by the Hand of Heaven, Sun Kin. They are servants, guards, teachers, doctors, and spiritual advisors. With their simple robes and dyed hands, they are an omnipresent and unpredictable force whose importance is disproportionate to their numbers. Anyone who wishes a presence in the court of the Emperor must, in some way, appease the Lotus Monks. Should someone displease the Emperor or offend the glory of the Empire, the consequences can be dramatic. Fortunately, they watch themselves as well as others, and any who stray are punished accordingly.&quot;

How quaint. Blood stains the hands much better than dye.

  <string id="114109" soundid="173618">One more thing you need to know. These weapons strike with deadly precision, but to wield them safely you must focus with each strike.</string>

  <string id="114113" soundid="173622">In time, Dawn Star will be able to handle a weapon like this, but don&apos;t discount the blade I gave her. Master Li wanted her to have the keenest steel I could find.</string>

  <string id="114716" soundid="174340">Nah, I just wanted to see if I could get the vixens to scrap a little. If I have to hang around here I should at least be entertained!</string>

  <string id="114723" soundid="174347">Nonsense. Make the most of what you are given. For instance, when my wife says my buns are terrible, it really means they weren&apos;t completely unpalatable.</string>

  <string id="114728" soundid="174352">Hmm... somewhere near one. I disregard the designs each time.</string>
  <string id="114729" soundid="174353">I thought the smaller flyers were earlier versions of the Dragonfly. Are you saying that you built this one without reference and just labeled it &quot;better?&quot;</string>
  <string id="114730" soundid="174354">Flyers are a product of inspiration. You don&apos;t glorify the new form by reusing parts or ideas. The Dragonfly is safe because I made it safe.</string>
  <string id="114731" soundid="174355">Besides, if the danger increased as you went back, that begs the existence of some primal contraption so perilous only the void beyond the heavens can hold it.</string>
  <string id="114734">A valid concern. Kang, what precautions have you made for safety?</string>
  <string id="114737">I don&apos;t care, it works well enough as it is.</string>
  <string id="114739">How do you make improvements if you start fresh each time?</string>
  <string id="114744">Everyone quiet. Silk Fox, please mind your tone.</string>
  <string id="114745">That&apos;s enough everyone. Dawn Star, I&apos;m sure Silk Fox meant no insult.</string>
  <string id="114746">Heavens help us, the Black Whirlwind has the best understanding of the situation.</string>
  <string id="114749">Let them fight, Zu. Brains and brawn, the epic struggle.</string>

Upon the Plain of Barren Hope roam the tribes of the Horselords, vicious nomads who frequently raid the borders of the Empire. These nomads are raised from birth in the saddle of their horses and can ride them as if the two were part of the same animal. Indeed, one of their chief gods, a vicious half-horse warrior, combines both of these aspects. He wields a composite recurve bow and a light cavalry lance. Philosophers debate whether the horselords themselves take their weapons from their god or their god took them as his own after seen the successes his people had with them.</string>

A collection of logs, notes and records maintained by the Yun family up until roughly fifteen years ago. One entry catches your eye.

&quot;My son seems utterly disinterested in the temple, and I worry that he pays no attention to the lessons I try to impart. The key, of course, remains in knowing that the seasons which most affect a forest are summer and winter, and the colors associated with these two seasons. If I am right and my lessons fly from his head as quickly as they can, then I fear for his safety should he attempt the ritual incorrectly. These furnaces are an ancient magic, and ancient magics draw dark attentions.&quot;

Another note, entered a bit later, reads, &quot;As I feared, my son pays little heed. Perhaps I will install something to remind him. Violet is not our family color, but I hope it can be a potent reminder.&quot;</string>

  <string id="115395">The Use of the Spear</string>
  <string id="115396">
The spear is the deadliest of weapons in the hands of a master. No other weapon can compare. Its length and reach allow a skilled user to strike with impunity from a distance, far from any retaliation, while the power of its strike is formidable. All the user&apos;s energy is focused on one tiny little point, allowing him to strike with blinding speed and punch through almost any armor. Additionally, the force with which an enemy approaches the user may be turned against him, adding to the power of the thrust. This is doubly valuable against a mounted enemy.</string>
  <string id="115397">The Hidden Leaf</string>
  <string id="115398">
In the Year of the Thousand Axes, there arose a warrior of such power and skill that none of his enemies, even champions of the Empire, could face him. He was Leaf. He was not a bloody man, and he disdained fighting for its own sake. He was the protector of a section of the Great Southern Forest. His duty was not to enforce law or order in his domain, but to protect something hidden, something secret, farther in the forest. It is not known what it was he was guarding, for one day he simply disappeared. Challenges went unanswered, and logging gradually reduced that section of the forest to fields.</string>
  <string id="115399">Text of War</string>
  <string id="115400">
In the art of war, it is not enough to have superiority in numbers, or strength in arms. True victory, lasting victory, is a cultural thing. To stop a conflict, you must not only defeat armies, you must defeat the will to fight. You must appease your enemy, convince them they have won, or eradicate them utterly. A nation with an expansive population, therefore, benefits from extermination. With a surplus of peasants, a newly cleared land can be rapidly repopulated, and, with an infrastructure of buildings already in place, made productive in short order. In the reign of Emperor Yuan Xi this was demonstrated most admirably in the marshlands to the south.</string>

  <string id="115462">Horse Lord Tactics</string>
  <string id="115463">
Unlike the ordered armies of the Jade Empire, the Horselords favor lightly armored units of horsemen, who can move rapidly over the field of battle. Moving like a rushing tide, small groups of horsemen harry all angles of their opponents&apos; flanks. Armed with bows, almost to a man, these mounted archers can rain destruction upon unprepared foes. While the Horselord tactics are surprisingly effective, their men lack the discipline of the Imperial Army; for all the damage they can inflict the horselord forces have difficulty holding strategic locations. For now, the Jade Empire exists in an uneasy peace with the Horselords, leaving the savages to their arid lands north of the Seat of Heaven Province.</string>
  <string id="115464">The Tricksters</string>
  <string id="115465">
The fox spirits are among the most wily and deceptive of all the minions of heaven. They think nothing of playing games with mortals, and they often follow no rules at all. Though some are said to serve honorably in the Celestial Bureaucracy, many more have made their mark in more sinister ways. Tales of demons snatching children from their beds, husbands and wives led astray, and good men led into lives of excess and murderous depravity are all the work of these spirits. Never, should you value your life, trust one of this breed completely, no matter how honorable their intentions seem.</string>
  <string id="115466">The Old Tongue, Vol. 1</string>
  <string id="115467">
&quot;Tho Fan,&quot; or The Old Tongue, was the native language of one of many kingdoms struggling for supremacy before the Empire was unified by Sagacious Tien, our first Emperor. As the wars raged, constant shifts in territorial leadership spread the use of the Old Tongue. By the time Sagacious Tien formed the Empire, the Old Tongue was so widely spread that it became a second official language of the Jade Empire.</string>
  <string id="115468">The Old Tongue, Vol. 2</string>
  <string id="115469">
There is no word in the Old Tongue for language. It merely is. There is no word for their people, since all of the original speakers of that language were &quot;the people.&quot; The closest word they had was &quot;us.&quot; Similarly, their word for their homeland was the same word they applied to the entire world.

In time, the true center of the world, the Jade Empire, emerged and breached the mountain surrounding this isolated civilization. As is often the case, savages cannot understand the benefits of a superior culture and must be forcibly educated in it for their own good. The wisdom of the emperors prevailed, and those people joined the growing Jade Empire.</string>
  <string id="115470">The Old Tongue, Vol. 3</string>
  <string id="115471">
The speakers of Tho Fan joyfully took to their new status as people of the Empire. After a small period of persecution, they became equals in our grand design and part of our glorious destiny. Indeed, they became such an integral part of the Empire that they spread to every corner of it, focusing mainly in the south and the Prosperous East. 

The Old Tongue became the second language of the Empire over the subsequent centuries and is spoken nearly everywhere. Indeed, most citizens of the Empire can understand and speak all the major languages, and even some of the regional dialects, with ease. The language reforms of Empress Heavenly Flower gave all citizens a common written language, which applied equally to all major tongues. In this way, centuries later, all who can read and write are understood everywhere in the Empire.</string>

The world is a place of order. When order is not enforced, chaos reigns. Chaos is the natural state of the world. The order that currently exists is the result of the power of the Great Dragon. Out of this streaming chaos, the Great Dragon created the world, perfect in every way. But nature, the forces of the universe, demand balance. For every bit of order, there must be corresponding chaos. That first world, that perfect world, was pure order. It could not last.

The perfect order choked life and did not allow growth, and so chaos was allowed back into the world.</string>
  <string id="115474">The Celestial Order, Vol. 2</string>
  <string id="115475">
The Great Dragon loosed chaos upon the world he had created, separating man from the beasts and laying the foundation for the eventual order that would unite humanity: this glorious Jade Empire. The great animal spirits of the past were cast out from the human communities, and Man was forever separated and elevated above the common beasts. Man was now the guardian of order, imposing his will on nature and shaping it to his desire.

But balance must exist in all things. Man was a bastion of order, with chaos in his heart. For as long as the world remains in chaos, man will always war and strive against his fellow man. This is the way of nature. Until the Great Dragon returns to bring the world to order or humanity brings itself above the cycle of nature, this is the way it will always be.</string>

  <string id="115477">
The Celestial Bureaucracy is made up of all the servants that the Great Dragon left behind to administer creation. According to the priests and augers, they know nothing of their creator or where it has gone. The Great Dragon has transcended heaven, they say. They, in their faithfulness, remain behind.

Or so they say. Over the millennia, many have fallen from their duties and have become part of the chaos in the world. This, we can only suppose, is part of creation as well. But as representatives of order, humanity suffers most from the attentions of these chaotic spirits and demons.</string>
  <string id="115478">The Nature of the Spirit, Vol. 1</string>
  <string id="115479">
Mankind has long known that we are not alone in this world. Descended from heaven, risen from the ground, present all around us are spirits. These beings often go unseen, but when they choose to interact with us, the effect is usually profound. But what are these beings? Are they people who have died? Are they servants created at the beginning of the world by the Great Dragon? Are they something else entirely? Or are they all of the above?

In my research I have managed to find and communicate with a number of them. I contacted some through priests or relatives, when it was a spirit returned from the dead. But other encounters were much stranger.</string>
  <string id="115480">The Nature of the Spirit, Vol. 2</string>
  <string id="115481">
One encounter brought vividly to mind was deep in a mine along the ridges near the Land of Howling Spirits. I was searching for a spirit I had seen the previous day, a spirit of moss and fungus that dwelt in this abandoned mine. Years earlier the mines were so prosperous that several communities depended on them for their livelihood, but collapses, fires, and unexplained disappearances in the mines led people to become more and more fearful of them. A local monk ventured in one night after hearing a disturbance, and he was never seen again. Thereafter, miners repeatedly reported hearing screams in the deepest tunnels in the voice of that young monk.</string>
  <string id="115482">The Nature of the Spirit, Vol. 3</string>
  <string id="115483">
The folktales surrounding the disappearance of the monk did not disturb me. The mines had been inactive for a century or more, and the surrounding villages had long since decayed. Any spirit that fed upon humans or human emotion or pain would have left in search of easier prey. Or so I had thought.

As I searched for the moss spirit that had brought me to the depths of that mine, I began to wonder if the legends were true after all. If the spirit or whatever it was that had driven away the miners could reside there still. In my mind, I began to hear the whispers in the dark and the screams and cries of those who lost their lives ages ago.</string>
  <string id="115484">The Nature of the Spirit, Vol. 4</string>
  <string id="115485">
It is said in the journals of the lost monks of the Jinzhi sect that there are spirits of every desire. By summoning that desire within themselves, men can commune with the spirit, summoning it to them. I can&apos;t imagine what kind of spirit must have been summoned in the dank of that mine. Darkness on all sides, only the slight flickering of that lamp. A great unknowable fear welled up within me. Those ancient monks knew too much, I think. They communed with their own dark desires too often. In that place, I, too, faced my fears. The circumstance and research that led me to that point scarcely prepared me for what I faced. The Dweller in the Depths spoke to me.</string>
  <string id="115486">The Nature of the Spirit, Vol. 5</string>
  <string id="115487">
It is clear to me now what manner of creatures these spirits are, and it is also clear what their goals are. For all that their lies portray them to be, the Celestial Bureaucracy is nothing more than the subjugation of man by the eternal beings of that court. The Dweller has shown me many things, many dark and terrible truths I could not have seen before, but which are clear to me now.

When I return, I know what they will say. The Emperor, the one closest to heaven, is their tool, their puppet. I know they will send him against me, fearing the power of my knowledge. Oh yes, I know. They will burn my works, but I must make copies, as the Dweller said, spreading my dark knowledge far enough that it will never be destroyed.

Remember this, reader: To a spirit, any spirit, the life of a human is worthless. We are tools and toys for their amusement alone.</string>
  <string id="115488">Music and the Arts</string>
  <string id="115489">
Music and the other arts are vital parts of life in the Jade Empire. As with any truly civilized people, even the common man can enjoy the benefits of music in his daily life. Only the music of the Jade Empire itself truly satiates this primal urge. The lesser, more savage peoples that surround us know nothing of true culture, and their primitive beatings and wailing cannot touch the soul as truly as have the masterpieces of Water Swallow or the heart-wrenching tragedy of Falling Star. For this reason, if not others, it is our duty as a cultured people to bring civilization and joy of the arts to those less advanced and gifted societies.</string>
  <string id="115490">Perception</string>
  <string id="115491">
What do you see? Is it what you think? Or is that just what you want to think? Isn&apos;t it much more pleasant to always see what you like, rather than what you don&apos;t? Would it be that much of a problem? Why not always view the world as perfect, discarding this tedious, fragile mortal shell for the bliss of the mind? This is the power that some spirits can offer. True enlightenment, true freedom from guilt and fear and the shackles of daily life. The priests and officials tell you that spirits are only there to tempt and steal and inflict pain, but that is part of *their* vision. It is their way of controlling you. The spirits are not our enemies, they are our saviors. Only by accepting their vision as truth can we be free.</string>

This gem makes its wielder capable of great physical feats that are normally only possible with years of training.

Never has a man or woman had greater fortune than a lowly farmer named Jun Bin. His mother gave him an amulet on the day of his birth, and he only removed it at the end of his life. He never knew misfortune and, indeed, could not understand it when others tried to explain it to him. He was kind but distracted, neither loved nor hated. The evils and ills of the world just never touched him, as if he was always in exactly the right place to avoid danger and harm.

  <string id="116025" soundid="176006">Yi is played on a board marked with nineteen horizontal and vertical lines. The objective is to place a series of stones to control the most territory by the game&apos;s end.</string>
  <string id="116026" soundid="176007">It is an ancient game, known by many names, but we prefer to call it by one of its oldest monikers.</string>
  <string id="116027" soundid="176008">You should learn it sometime. It helps to focus the mind and to understand that every action must have a purpose.</string>
  <string id="116028" soundid="176009">Desperation, mostly. Neither Vo nor I have the time to carry around our boards, or the exquisite slate pieces. Our lives are too full of battle to risk such things.</string>
  <string id="116029" soundid="176010">So we have learned to make this a contest of the mind. To hold the game at the front of our thoughts.</string>
  <string id="116030" soundid="176011">How long has it been since I realized what a fool you are, Jian?</string>
  <string id="116031" soundid="176012">Pfaw! Thirty years ago, you decided to embrace &quot;harmony.&quot; Why did I teach you anything, I wonder?</string>
  <string id="116032" soundid="176013">Because you saw potential in me, the same way I now see potential in you. The Way of the Closed Fist must become a tiring way to live at your age, Jian.</string>
  <string id="116033" soundid="176014">Come back when you feel you understand the Way of the Closed Fist. I might consider teaching you a little something, if you do.</string>
  <string id="116034" soundid="176015">Yes, do that.</string>
  <string id="116035" soundid="176016">You fight well for a young man. You strike with strength, but also with purpose. You will go far in this world, and possibly....</string>
  <string id="116036" soundid="176017">Careful.</string>
  <string id="116037" soundid="176018">Well... that is something you will determine for yourself, isn&apos;t it?</string>
  <string id="116038" soundid="176019">Nothing of import. Just an old man&apos;s mutterings. Don&apos;t worry yourself about them.</string>
  <string id="116039" soundid="176020">I would say that you have. In my youth, you would not have had such an easy time of it, you understand!</string>
  <string id="116040" soundid="176021">Indeed I did.</string>
  <string id="116041" soundid="176022">Well? Hurry up and train the girl, Jian. She&apos;s clearly not the type who likes to be kept waiting. You wouldn&apos;t teach her if she were.</string>
  <string id="116042" soundid="176023">Would you quit prattling and train the lad, Jian? Your best students tend to be quick to anger and unforgiving of old goats.</string>
  <string id="116043" soundid="176024">How little you know my way, Vo. This one&apos;s too smart to kill me *before* learning my style.</string>
  <string id="116044" soundid="176025">Here. I will teach you how to demand the obedience of the winds and the storms. The secrets of Tempest will be yours!</string>
  <string id="116045" soundid="176026">There. You have it now.</string>
  <string id="116046" soundid="176027">No one should call me Master. I am just Jian the Iron Fist. I stopped being a master when my best student decided my teachings were flawed.</string>
  <string id="116047" soundid="176028">Not flawed, Jian, just misguided. You shouldn&apos;t take it so personally.</string>
  <string id="116048" soundid="176029">No, there is still more to learn, but you can only learn it yourself.</string>
  <string id="116049" soundid="176030">Remember to remain true to the discord in your heart. Only then will the storms serve you as you wish.</string>
  <string id="116050" soundid="176031">I think it&apos;s time we were leaving, don&apos;t you, Jian?</string>
  <string id="116051" soundid="176032">Indeed. Enough games for now. I will see you again next year, Vo?</string>
  <string id="116052" soundid="176033">You think you&apos;ll live until next year, Jian? You know our paths will cross on the field of battle sooner than that.</string>
  <string id="116053" soundid="176034">Ha! You&apos;ve said that for twenty years. Time will win a victory you cannot.</string>
  <string id="116054" soundid="176035">Just when I was about to crush Mistress Vo&apos;s position. Ah well, Yi is a patient game. What do you want of me?</string>
  <string id="116055" soundid="176036">Is that so? Let me see.</string>
  <string id="116056" soundid="176037">Hmph. You think you understand the Way of the Closed Fist do you? We shall see.</string>
  <string id="116057" soundid="176038">Face me. Show me your strength. Show me that you are a better student than Vo ever was.</string>
  <string id="116058" soundid="176039">Be wary. This old tiger has sharp fangs and long claws. He can teach you a style rarely used in the Jade Empire, but you will have to beat it out of him.</string>
  <string id="116063">What were you about to say there?</string>
  <string id="116065">Have I proven myself sufficiently to you?</string>
  <string id="116067">Enough talking. You promised to teach me if I could beat you.</string>
  <string id="116073">An honor to learn from you, Master.</string>
  <string id="116076">You have taught me everything?</string>
  <string id="116082">I seek your training, Master Jian.</string>
  <string id="116086">Do we truly need to fight? Couldn&apos;t you just train me?</string>
  <string id="116088">I&apos;ll happily face you right now.</string>
  <string id="116089">If you&apos;re lucky, I won&apos;t kill you.</string>
  <string id="116090">I don&apos;t want to fight you right now.</string>
  <string id="116097">Tell me about yourself.</string>
  <string id="116098">What&apos;s your history with Mistress Vo?</string>
  <string id="116103">How can you fight at your age?</string>
  <string id="116105">That&apos;s all I wished to know about you.</string>
  <string id="116106">Explain to me the principles of the Tempest style.</string>
  <string id="116109">Remind me why you two are here again?</string>
  <string id="116111">Tell me about Yi. How is it played?</string>
  <string id="116114">How can you play a game with no pieces or board?</string>
  <string id="116116">How long have you two been playing?</string>
  <string id="116119">I&apos;ll leave you to your game.</string>
  <string id="116120" soundid="176101">Well done. Very few can withstand Stone Immortal; only those who understand the world around them, in fact.</string>
  <string id="116121" soundid="176102">You understand your place, and yet you are not afraid to use your strength when it is required. That will serve you well in this lifetime, and....</string>
  <string id="116122" soundid="176103">Good. This will not be an easy test, but I suspect you are ready for it.</string>
  <string id="116123" soundid="176104">You need to be ready. Find peace, and then return to me.</string>
  <string id="116124" soundid="176105">There&apos;s no spine in children born in these wet times, Vo, none at all. You had the gumption to test yourself against me without hesitation</string>
  <string id="116125" soundid="176106">You know as well as I that this one was born before the drought was ended, Jian.</string>
  <string id="116126" soundid="176107">Let her be, this matter is between us, not you. Now, it is your move, I believe.</string>
  <string id="116127" soundid="176108">Let him be, this matter does not concern you, except that it is now your move.</string>
  <string id="116128" soundid="176109">You have some understanding of the Way of the Open Palm, but Stone Immortal is not easily taught.</string>
  <string id="116129" soundid="176110">Return to me when you feel you understand the Way of the Open Palm. Then you will be ready.</string>
  <string id="116130" soundid="176111">Are you so certain? If you are, then you must strive to understand the Way of the Open Palm.</string>
  <string id="116131" soundid="176112">Perhaps you should talk to Master Jian. He reserves his respect for those who follow his philosophy.</string>
  <string id="116132" soundid="176113">I respect your philosophy, Vo. The Way of the Open Palm encourages weakness, and weak people are easily cowed by the rest of us.</string>
  <string id="116133" soundid="176114">You have not found me so weak, Jian. Not at all.</string>
  <string id="116134" soundid="176115">You know my name, that&apos;s really all that&apos;s important, isn&apos;t it? Not many know of my exploits outside of the Prosperous East.</string>
  <string id="116135" soundid="176116">I was once his student, until I decided I couldn&apos;t agree with all of his teachings. He was an excellent master, but I couldn&apos;t follow his philosophies.</string>
  <string id="116136" soundid="176117">Twenty years have passed since we parted ways, and while we disagree on principle, I can&apos;t help but feel some affection for the old man.</string>
  <string id="116137" soundid="176118">Old! Ha, there&apos;s more life still left in these old bones than you&apos;ve ever had.</string>
  <string id="116138" soundid="176119">This is why we only meet once a year to play Yi. Jian the Iron Fist is best taken in... small doses.</string>
  <string id="116139" soundid="176120">A wonderful province, and yes, one that I call home. You should visit sometime and see the wonders of Phoenix Gate.</string>
  <string id="116140" soundid="176121">Of course, the Imperial City still stands as the greatest city, but Phoenix Gate has its own charms. Standing on the sea of glass, it is a hub of trade.</string>
  <string id="116141" soundid="176122">Each year, Jian and I make our way here to the Seat of Heaven province to meet for a few days of Yi. It&apos;s something of a ritual.</string>
  <string id="116142" soundid="176123">It was nice to talk for a while.</string>
  <string id="116143" soundid="176124">Stone Immortal allows you to control the earth itself. It is not easy to master.</string>
  <string id="116144" soundid="176125">To understand the earth, you must be aware of all things around you, and understand that they are all connected in one way or another.</string>
  <string id="116145" soundid="176126">That is why Stone Immortal is only taught to those who follow the Way of the Open Palm. Our sense of harmony aids us in persuading the earth to serve as our ally.</string>
  <string id="116146" soundid="176127">We come here each year to play Yi. Its mysteries are subtle, but the play of white on black, the struggle for territory, and the delicate strategy provide endless entertainment.</string>
  <string id="116147" soundid="176128">To be fair, I&apos;m not sure if we enjoy the game or bickering more.</string>
  <string id="116148" soundid="176129">You should ask Jian. He is the expert on this ancient game. Or so he likes to believe.</string>
  <string id="116149" soundid="176130">When you feel that you sufficiently understand the Way of the Open Palm, return to me.</string>
  <string id="116150" soundid="176131">I wish you well.</string>
  <string id="116151" soundid="176132">Careful.</string>
  <string id="116152" soundid="176133">As I said. That will serve you well.</string>
  <string id="116153" soundid="176134">Don&apos;t mind me. I was just thinking out loud. Students of your caliber are rare.</string>
  <string id="116154" soundid="176135">None. You walk the high path, and you are a skilled warrior. That is enough for me.</string>
  <string id="116155" soundid="176136">If you&apos;re finished with this little charade of a test, could you please train the girl, Vo? Further coddling will only weaken her.</string>
  <string id="116156" soundid="176137">If you two are finished praising each other&apos;s relative harmonies, would you please train the lad, Vo? My stomach won&apos;t handle more sugar.</string>
  <string id="116157" soundid="176138">Don&apos;t mind him. Men become temperamental at his age, </string>
  <string id="116158" soundid="176139">Here, let me teach you to coax the earth to do your bidding. Only your connection to the world and your understanding of your place will convince them.</string>
  <string id="116159" soundid="176140">There, you have it.</string>
  <string id="116160" soundid="176141">It was an honor to teach what I could. I am not the instructor Master Jian was, but his lessons would not have suited your temperament.</string>
  <string id="116161" soundid="176142">I am just Jian the Iron Fist. My best pupil turned away from my instructions, after all.</string>
  <string id="116162" soundid="176143">No, there is still more to learn, but you can only learn it yourself.</string>
  <string id="116163" soundid="176144">Remember to remain true to the high path. The earth only serves those who know their place among all things.</string>
  <string id="116164" soundid="176145">Enough of this. I would say our game is concluded, Vo. It is time we parted ways.</string>
  <string id="116165" soundid="176146">Indeed. Shall we meet again next year, Jian?</string>
  <string id="116166" soundid="176147">You won&apos;t last that long. Our paths will cross, and you&apos;ll learn that this old tiger still has all his teeth.</string>
  <string id="116167" soundid="176148">You have made that proclamation every year for two decades. Those teeth must be frightfully long by now. How ever do you open your mouth anymore?</string>
  <string id="116168" soundid="176149">Until next year, you old goat.</string>
  <string id="116169" soundid="176150">Always a pleasure to talk to another warrior. My game of Yi with Jian can wait a moment. What can I do for you?</string>
  <string id="116170" soundid="176151">Yes, I know. It is good that you have come to me. You deserve to learn to control the earth, but you must also learn that the stone can never truly be controlled.</string>
  <string id="116171" soundid="176152">What she means to say is that if you cannot defeat her Stone Immortal style, the earth will tear you apart, or swallow you whole.</string>
  <string id="116172" soundid="176153">It is the only way you will learn the true secrets of Stone Immortal. I will not force you into this decision.</string>
  <string id="116173" soundid="176154">There is no need to fight at all, but if you wish to learn and to grow, you must be prepared to make sacrifices and take risks.</string>
  <string id="116174" soundid="176155">The key is to ensure that those risks are worthwhile for all involved. I&apos;m sure you know what you must do in this case.</string>
  <string id="116178">What were you about to say there?</string>
  <string id="116180">Are there other tasks I must complete before you train me?</string>
  <string id="116186">An honor to learn from you, Mistress Vo.</string>
  <string id="116189">You have taught me everything?</string>
  <string id="116196">I seek your training, Mistress Vo.</string>
  <string id="116199">Do we truly need to fight? Couldn&apos;t you just train me?</string>
  <string id="116201">I will face Stone Immortal with no fear in my heart.</string>
  <string id="116202">I don&apos;t want to fight you right now.</string>
  <string id="116210">Tell me about yourself.</string>
  <string id="116211">What&apos;s the story between you and Jian?</string>
  <string id="116215">You spend most of your time in the Prosperous East?</string>
  <string id="116218">That&apos;s all I wished to know about you.</string>
  <string id="116219">Explain to me the principles of the Stone Immortal style.</string>
  <string id="116222">Remind me why you two are here again?</string>
  <string id="116225">I&apos;ll leave you to your game.</string>
  <string id="116226" soundid="176207">You play too conservatively, Vo. You must be bold when playing a game of Yi. Did I teach you nothing?</string>
  <string id="116227" soundid="176208">You taught me much, Jian, but the most valuable lessons were learning where you were wrong. Seventeenth square of the lion, if you please.</string>
  <string id="116228" soundid="176209">Hrmpf. A wise move, but you know you cannot win. You stall this game the way you hestitated to learn of harmonic combinations. You must be bold, Vo.</string>
  <string id="116229" soundid="176210">You are being rude, Jian. We have a guest. Let us place the game on hold a moment.</string>
  <string id="116230" soundid="176211">I was doing my best to ignore you, too. Very well, what do you want from Jian the Iron Fist or Mistress Vo? If you are here for training, I refuse!</string>
  <string id="116231" soundid="176212">We are having our game of Yi interrupted. Playing without the board or pieces is hard enough without some stranger interrupting.</string>
  <string id="116232" soundid="176213">Surely you know of Yi, &quot;the capturing game?&quot; Played on a board of nineteen rows and columns, the black and white pieces capture territory for their player.</string>
  <string id="116233" soundid="176214">We have simply decided to do away with the board. If one is properly focused, it is not so hard to keep the game in one&apos;s mind.</string>
  <string id="116234" soundid="176215">None. Too many people seek our guidance.</string>
  <string id="116235" soundid="176216">Do not be so hasty, Jian. You did not turn me aside all those years ago.</string>
  <string id="116236" soundid="176217">And look where that got us! Your foolish devotion to the Way of the Open Palm drove you from my tutelage and made you weak. No more! End of subject.</string>
  <string id="116237" soundid="176218">Then you should ask them of someone who cares!</string>
  <string id="116238" soundid="176219">Forgive him. Had my former master bothered to remember his manners, he might have told you that we are not from Tien&apos;s Landing. We know little of the events here.</string>
  <string id="116239" soundid="176220">The Empire posts a minister to look after this place. Sheng is his name, I think. Pester him if you must know about this place.</string>
  <string id="116240" soundid="176221">Jian the Iron Fist isn&apos;t honestly going to let *this* one walk away, is he? If you don&apos;t say anything, then I will, you old goat.</string>
  <string id="116241" soundid="176222">As much as it pains me, Vo is right. I see potential in you, greater strength than the dozens of worms who compete for my favor.</string>
  <string id="116242" soundid="176223">I, too, see strength, but also the capacity for understanding the world and your place in it. You could prove an interesting pupil.</string>
  <string id="116243" soundid="176224">Ha! Well said. You&apos;re wrong, of course, but that&apos;s the right spirit!</string>
  <string id="116244" soundid="176225">I will make you an offer. Show me that you understand every nuance of the Way of the Closed Fist, and I will teach you how to bend the storms to your will through Tempest.</string>
  <string id="116245" soundid="176226">He would like nothing more than to have you as a student, but show me that you walk the Way of the Open Palm, and I will teach you the mysteries of Stone Immortal.</string>
  <string id="116246" soundid="176227">I have heard of Tempest. You can control the very air using that style, but that only those who walk the Way of the Open Palm have ever mastered it.</string>
  <string id="116247" soundid="176228">That is a difficult choice. Both styles are said to be powerful, but only in the right hands.</string>
  <string id="116248" soundid="176229">Who needs magic? A pair of trusty axes at your side can do wonders controlling the earth and air never could. </string>
  <string id="116249" soundid="176230">Both Tempest and Stone Immortal are very sensitive to your... temperament. Harmony or discord can affect your ability to control air and earth respectively.</string>
  <string id="116250" soundid="176231">We will be here for some time, if you wish either of our tutelage, but do not ask us to guide you on your path. Learning the Ways on your own is the most important lesson.</string>
  <string id="116255">What exactly are you doing?</string>
  <string id="116258">What kind of training can you two offer?</string>
  <string id="116261">I have some questions about Tien&apos;s Landing.</string>
  <string id="116264">I&apos;ll leave you two to your game.</string>
  <string id="116265">Maybe I should just leave you alone.</string>
  <string id="116268">Does this mean you will train me?</string>
  <string id="116269">What are you getting at?</string>
  <string id="116270">I don&apos;t need your approval. There is no need to weigh my merits.</string>

  <string id="116376">Death&apos;s too good for you.</string>
  <string id="116381">That&apos;s better.</string>
  <string id="116382">Cursed poisoner!</string>
  <string id="116383">Hurts, doesn&apos;t it?</string>
  <string id="116384">I... I can&apos;t hurt you?</string>
  <string id="116385">I&apos;ll kill you if I can!</string>

Every worthwhile goal requires hardship and struggle. A victory gained with ease means nothing. The struggle defines the worth of a goal. A true step on the path to power demands it.

Safety Information About Photosensitive Seizures

A very small percentage of people may experience a seizure when exposed to certain visual images, including flashing lights or patterns that may appear in video games. Even people who have no history of seizures or epilepsy may have an undiagnosed condition that can cause these &quot;photosensitive epileptic seizures&quot; while watching video games. These seizures may have a variety of symptoms, including lightheadedness, altered vision, eye or face twitching, jerking or shaking of arms or legs, disorientation, confusion, or momentary loss of awareness. Seizures may also cause loss of consciousness or convulsions that can lead to injury from falling down or striking nearby objects. Immediately stop playing and consult a doctor if you experience any of these symptoms. Parents should watch for or ask their children about the above symptoms-children and teenagers are more likely than adults to experience these seizures.

The risk of photosensitive epileptic seizures may be reduced by sitting farther from the television screen, using a smaller television screen, playing in a well-lit room, and not playing when you are drowsy or fatigued.

If you or any of your relatives have a history of seizures or epilepsy, consult a doctor before playing.

  <string id="119352" soundid="179697">I saw nothing. Are you sure you didn&apos;t hit your head when you crawled out of the Dragonfly?</string>
  <string id="119353" soundid="179698">Surely Her Highness isn&apos;t jealous that I can see things she can&apos;t?</string>
  <string id="119354" soundid="179699">Make light of it if you want, but he said that we should search Dirge.</string>
  <string id="119355" soundid="179700">The magic that restored the temple also destroyed spells that cloaked chests hidden in the ruins. The monks used these chests to hide treasures, including powerful weapons.</string>
  <string id="119356" soundid="179701">They didn&apos;t want them to fall into the Emperor&apos;s hands. He said that one was nearby. Maybe we can find it before we reach the bridge. Lead on.</string>
  <string id="119357" soundid="179702">You must listen to me, girl. There isn&apos;t much time. You must search Dirge and look for the chests that were hidden all these years.</string>
  <string id="119358" soundid="179703">When the Emperor attacked, we hid ancient weapons and other treasures in these chests, to keep them safe from Sun Hai&apos;s greedy hands.</string>
  <string id="119359" soundid="179704">With the wards restored, spells that had hidden these chests were wiped away. You must find them if you can; they will be all throughout Dirge.</string>
  <string id="119360" soundid="179705">What are you staring at? Shouldn&apos;t we be going to the bridge?</string>
  <string id="119361" soundid="179706">You didn&apos;t see him, did you? It doesn&apos;t matter. I know what we&apos;re looking for. Follow me.</string>
  <string id="119373">AUTOSAVING...</string>
  <string id="119400">Total Gems: %d</string>

  <string id="119416">To the Throne Room</string>
  <string id="119422">Hingoo Arrested</string>
  <string id="119428">For the Emperor!</string>
  <string id="119434">Mission Complete!</string>
  <string id="119464" soundid="198041">Perhaps a more direct application of my power will show you what you are up against...</string>
  <string id="119467" soundid="198042">...and just how restrictive your shell truly is.</string>
  <string id="119471" soundid="195298">No!</string>
  <string id="119472" soundid="198043">Yes, this will amuse me. Worse than actually dying. Seeing death come and being unable to stop it.</string>
  <string id="119480" soundid="195299"></string>
  <string id="119490" soundid="197533"></string>
  <string id="119492" soundid="195300">I won&apos;t let you disgrace the Empire!</string>
  <string id="119493" soundid="195301">ENOUGH!</string>
  <string id="119494" soundid="195302">ENOUGH!</string>
  <string id="119495" soundid="195303"></string>
  <string id="119497" soundid="198049">Go! I will do what I must.</string>
  <string id="119500" soundid="198051"></string>
  <string id="119505" soundid="179851">Horrible. If the Emperor really is behind this, he&apos;s a monster.</string>
  <string id="119506" soundid="179852">How does this glorify the Emperor? I know we will discover that Death&apos;s hand is behind it all.</string>
  <string id="119507" soundid="179853">If this really is the Emperor&apos;s bidding, he is a true villain.</string>
  <string id="119508" soundid="179854">I suppose it puts them to use, but it&apos;s not really the way to treat a fallen enemy.</string>
  <string id="119509" soundid="179855">This is what we fight against? Death&apos;s Hand or the Emperor, we face a monster.</string>
  <string id="119510" soundid="179856">I don&apos;t like this machine. It smells like dead things.</string>
  <string id="119512" soundid="179858">Hopefully service under Master Gang will lead us to the information we need. We knew about the golems, but is Death&apos;s Hand or the Emperor behind it all?</string>
  <string id="119513" soundid="179859">Find Master Gang. Once we are close enough to the heart of the Assassins we can prove Death&apos;s Hand is behind this golem army.</string>
  <string id="119514" soundid="179860">Serving Master Gang should lead us to the information we need. Is Death&apos;s Hand or the Emperor behind the golem army?</string>
  <string id="119515" soundid="179861">So we serve Gang until we find the information we need? I&apos;d rather fight the golem army. That would draw out their leaders, whether Death&apos;s Hand or the Emperor.</string>
  <string id="119516" soundid="179862">We know of the golem army, but who is behind it, Death&apos;s Hand or the Emperor? I suppose we have no choice but to seek this Master Gang. </string>
  <string id="119517" soundid="179863">So does this place belong to Death&apos;s Hand or the Emperor? Maybe Mister Gang can say who is building these clay men.</string>
  <string id="119519" soundid="179865"></string>
  <string id="119520" soundid="179866">Shouldn&apos;t we be going to the bridge? It&apos;s not going to defend itself.</string>
  <string id="119521" soundid="179867">You&apos;ve already found that new blade, don&apos;t you want to try it out?</string>
  <string id="119522" soundid="179868">Either try and find one of these mysterious chests you were talking about or head to the bridge. Either way, be quick about it!</string>
  <string id="119523" soundid="179869"></string>
  <string id="119524" soundid="179870">I have to admit, you handled yourself very well out there. For a farm girl, that is.</string>
  <string id="119525" soundid="179871">I&apos;m sure I couldn&apos;t have done half as well without a princess there to keep one or two busy while I did all the work.</string>
  <string id="119526" soundid="179872">That&apos;s clearly the problem with you people from Two Rivers: no respect for royalty. Must be something in the water.</string>
  <string id="119527" soundid="179873">We should get back to the temple. Go on, Dawn Star, I&apos;ll follow your lead...for now.</string>
  <string id="119528" soundid="179874">Shouldn&apos;t we be heading back to the temple?</string>
  <string id="119529" soundid="179875">You have your sword, and I&apos;m sure if there&apos;s more weapons lying about, Wild Flower will sense them.</string>
  <string id="119530" soundid="179876">Unless you were looking for something else?</string>
  <string id="119538" soundid="179884">How could you do that? How can you just kill a man in cold blood? I am worried this journey to find Master Li is changing you.</string>
  <string id="119539" soundid="179885">Quick and to the point. I like it. I just hope we&apos;re done with this whole matter now.</string>
  <string id="119540" soundid="179886">That was a little uncalled for. I&apos;m no stranger to violence, but even I shy away from killing a defenseless man.</string>
  <string id="119542" soundid="179888"></string>
  <string id="119543" soundid="179889">You&apos;re not supposed to be here. [giggle] And we can&apos;t let you go up there either.</string>
  <string id="119544" soundid="179890"></string>
  <string id="119545" soundid="179891">*I* won&apos;t let you go up there!</string>
  <string id="119546" soundid="179892"></string>
  <string id="119547" soundid="179893">Ya Zhen: Well, well. They&apos;ve sent you here to die, you know. A noble sacrifice, but one made in vain.</string>
  <string id="119548" soundid="179894"></string>
  <string id="119549" soundid="179895">I will enjoy your suffering to the last drop!</string>
  <string id="119550" soundid="179896"></string>
  <string id="119551" soundid="179897"></string>
  <string id="119552" soundid="179898">Something...</string>
  <string id="119553" soundid="179899"></string>
  <string id="119554" soundid="179900">Chai Ka: There is a power here... something old, but powerful. A relic of the Spirit Monks.</string>
  <string id="119555" soundid="179901">Chai Ka: Time is short, but it may prove useful. We should return to the others as soon as possible.</string>
  <string id="119556" soundid="179902"></string>
  <string id="119557" soundid="179903"></string>
  <string id="119558" soundid="179904">A power... nearby.</string>
  <string id="119559" soundid="179905">Something from... the Spirit Monks? Perhaps...</string>
  <string id="119560" soundid="179906">Whatever it is, it may be useful. And I have time before our absence is noticed.</string>
  <string id="119561" soundid="179907"></string>
  <string id="119562" soundid="179908">Ya Zhen: I must return before too long, but... it is time enough to find this power.</string>
  <string id="119584" soundid="179930">My goodness... I didn&apos;t see that coming. Please warn me when you&apos;re about to remove a man&apos;s head from his shoulders. I&apos;d like to avoid the spatter of blood next time.</string>
  <string id="119585" soundid="179931">Hmph. He certainly spewed a lot of blood for such a tiny guy. But otherwise, a nice clean death.</string>
  <string id="119586" soundid="180024">I certainly hope you know what you&apos;re doing. Trusting our lives to the river is one thing, but trusting them to this drunken boatswain is another matter entirely.</string>
  <string id="119587" soundid="179933"></string>
  <string id="119589" soundid="179935">That kid&apos;s kinda creepy, even for me.</string>
  <string id="119590" soundid="179936">Why would you do that? You could have helped that girl. Instead, you&apos;ve made her worse.</string>
  <string id="119591" soundid="179937">I don&apos;t approve of this. That girl needed a friend... I could sense her spirit; you could have helped her.</string>
  <string id="119592" soundid="179938">This whole ordeal is making my spine crawl. If we&apos;re done here I suggest we keep moving.</string>
  <string id="119593" soundid="179939">Is this over finally? We have more important matters to deal with than helping these long dead children.</string>
  <string id="119594" soundid="179940">That poor girl. I can sense her pain. I think we should have tried to help more.</string>
  <string id="119595" soundid="179941"></string>
  <string id="119597" soundid="179943"></string>
  <string id="119598" soundid="179944">There isn&apos;t time to talk. We have to look after the bridge before we do anything.</string>
  <string id="119599" soundid="179945">I doubt there would be more than the chest we&apos;ve already found this far away from the temple. Let&apos;s go make sure Kang hasn&apos;t been distracted.</string>
  <string id="119600" soundid="179946">If you want to hunt for one of the chests the monk told me about, be quick.</string>
  <string id="119601" soundid="179947"></string>
  <string id="119602" soundid="179948">You handle yourself pretty well for a spoiled and coddled noble.</string>
  <string id="119603" soundid="179949">High praise from a farm girl.</string>
  <string id="119604" soundid="179950">At Your Highness&apos; service. We should get back to the temple. Lead on, I&apos;ll be right behind you.</string>
  <string id="119605" soundid="179951">We should go back to the temple.</string>
  <string id="119606" soundid="179952">There&apos;s nothing more for us to do down here.</string>
  <string id="119607" soundid="179953">Though you might want to look around for a chest first. It&apos;s up to you.</string>
  <string id="119614" soundid="179960">I don&apos;t know what to make of Zu. He seems so tormented.</string>
  <string id="119615" soundid="179961">Be careful of him. I never believed he was on our side.</string>
  <string id="119616" soundid="179962">A confusing man, that Zu. I wonder if *he* even knows what side he is on.</string>
  <string id="119617" soundid="179963">If he joined the enemy, why doesn&apos;t he just attack? The chatty ones are the most annoying.</string>
  <string id="119618" soundid="179964">I worry about Sagacious Zu. And about what he has in store for us.</string>
  <string id="119619" soundid="179965">So, is he a friend or not? Let&apos;s hurry and get out of here. This place holds bad feelings.</string>
  <string id="119620" soundid="179966">What? I knew you had a troubled past... that you were asked to do horrible things, but this is beyond anything I imagined.</string>
  <string id="119621" soundid="179967">You throw these accusations at your superiors and my father, but we have no reason to believe you.</string>
  <string id="119622" soundid="179968">I would not want to own the guilt for such an act. I pity you.</string>
  <string id="119623" soundid="179969">There is no challenge in that. Kill who you must, but they should be able to fight.</string>
  <string id="119624" soundid="179970">I have had my suspicions all along. Now it appears those concerns were well founded.</string>
  <string id="119625" soundid="179971">This doesn&apos;t sound right. You wouldn&apos;t do something so mean, would you?</string>
  <string id="119628">Push &lt;Focus&gt; to Exit</string>
  <string id="119631" soundid="179977">I never enjoy controlling my senses, they catch a lot of things I&apos;d miss. Whatever. We&apos;d better tell the others we&apos;ve made some progress.</string>
  <string id="119632" soundid="179978">Success, after a fashion. We should go inform the others after we leave the arena.</string>
  <string id="119633" soundid="179979">Well, that&apos;s certainly news. I&apos;ll reserve my judgment about whether it&apos;s good. Let&apos;s go tell the others once we leave the arena.</string>
  <string id="119634" soundid="179980">Good. I knew you could be relied upon. The others will want to know; we should go see them after we leave the arena.</string>
  <string id="119635" soundid="179981">Typical, sowing seeds of distrust in their new &quot;recruits.&quot; Once we&apos;re out of here, let&apos;s go tell the others about our success.</string>
  <string id="119636" soundid="179982">Chai Ka: You work quickly, but they see potential. The others will want to know of your success after we leave the arena.</string>
  <string id="119637" soundid="179983">Ya Zhen: This should be fun for everyone involved. The Assassins are my kind of people, insofar as I hate pretty much everyone. Let&apos;s go tell the others after we leave the arena.</string>
  <string id="119638" soundid="179984"></string>
  <string id="119647" soundid="179993">That explains how they are produced in such numbers, but is it for the Emperor or Death&apos;s Hand?</string>
  <string id="119648" soundid="179994">Death&apos;s Hand has great power. We need proof of this from the inner chambers.</string>
  <string id="119649" soundid="179995">So the army can grow fast, but under who&apos;s authority?</string>
  <string id="119650" soundid="179996">Fake warriors? Whoever runs this has no idea what makes battle fun.</string>
  <string id="119651" soundid="179997">We have to find proof of Death&apos;s Hand ordering this, but I don&apos;t want it in *anybody&apos;s* hands.</string>
  <string id="119652" soundid="179998">That&apos;s a lot of clay men for the Emperor, or is it Death&apos;s Hand? We have to find out which, right?</string>
  <string id="119677" soundid="180025">I hope this floating log can handle the weight of a man like me. If I fall in I&apos;m taking both of you with me!</string>
  <string id="119678" soundid="180026">Well, it would seem we have little choice. I certainly hope we won&apos;t regret asking Ru to help us.</string>
  <string id="119679" soundid="180027">I&apos;m all for taking risk, but only when I&apos;m making the rules. I have a hard time trusting the skills of this drunken boatswain.</string>
  <string id="119680" soundid="180028">I suppose this is the only way for us to continue. I just hope he isn&apos;t wasting our time.</string>
  <string id="119681" soundid="180029">I... guess I&apos;ll have to trust you, but I really don&apos;t like boats... or the water.</string>
  <string id="119682" soundid="180030">He&apos;s got a good point about the drinking. If that&apos;s all it took to be considered a drunk... well, I think you know where this is going.</string>
  <string id="119683" soundid="180031">I doubt that man could open a door, never mind a dam.</string>
  <string id="119684" soundid="180032">That man has the tools to be a great drunken master. Unfortunately you have to actually be sober to learn the style.</string>

  <string id="120542">Such horror!</string>
  <string id="120543" soundid="181150">Be serious. This worries me. The world seems to be filling up with wayward spirits. That it affected the Forest Shadow is very disturbing.</string>
  <string id="120544" soundid="181151">That is very sweet of you to say. We should get back to what we need to do. Is there anything else you need?</string>
  <string id="120545">Don&apos;t feel bad for being special. In my eyes, you have no choice.</string>
  <string id="120546">You let that slip to interest me. Tell me about it.</string>
  <string id="120547">You know you can ask me for anything as long as I have your company.</string>
  <string id="120548">Tell me about that. How... sensitive are you?</string>
  <string id="120550">You stand out. I prefer that. I know the feeling.</string>
  <string id="120551">I&apos;ve always been interested in you. Tell me what you remember.</string>
  <string id="120552">And I value you a great deal as well. What did you want to talk about?</string>
  <string id="120553">We can put things right if we stay together.</string>
  <string id="120554">If you depend on me, I consider that a privilege, not a burden.</string>
  <string id="120555">I welcome that admission. What is on your mind?</string>
  <string id="120578" soundid="181193">It would seem that my past is catching up to me, and you are destined to be swept along. You have faced your first spirit opponents far sooner than I intended.</string>
  <string id="120579" soundid="181194">Dawn Star can explain the nature of such creatures. I must go and make sure everything is in place. I thought I had more time, but perhaps you are ready.</string>
  <string id="120581" soundid="181196">Do not be so quick to thank me. My influence caused this attack. You were not meant to see this yet, but now there is no choice. I will explain at the school.</string>
  <string id="120582" soundid="181197">You have done well, but more than this awaits you. See to your fellow villagers and students and return to me at the school. We have... a great deal to discuss.</string>
  <string id="120583" soundid="181198">You would have fought, and you would have died. You are not ready, but you soon will be. There is no choice left to us. I will explain at the school.</string>
  <string id="120587">Thank you for your assistance, Master Li.</string>
  <string id="120590">Why did you step in? I could have fought him.</string>
  <string id="120597" soundid="187931">Ah, you&apos;re one of them, are you? Follower of the Way of the Closed Fist? Whatever your motives, I think we both understand the language of silver.</string>
  <string id="120598" soundid="187932">Ha. You know, I honestly didn&apos;t think you&apos;d do it.</string>
  <string id="120601" soundid="187933">You make an interesting point. These people complained when the old town was flooded, and now they complain about just the opposite.</string>
  <string id="120602" soundid="187934">A businessman with plenty of silver to spare might be able to restore the old town, and control most of the land around here.</string>
  <string id="120603" soundid="187935">Yes, I think Tien&apos;s Landing would do quite well under my... guidance. The next few years will be interesting times.</string>
  <string id="120604" soundid="187936">A philosopher with a head for business. Will wonders never cease?</string>
  <string id="120605" soundid="187937">Yes, of course. I will remember your help. I have a feeling crossing you would be the act of an idiot.</string>
  <string id="120606">I prefer something useful. Your weapon, for example.</string>
  <string id="120607">Physical strength is the quality I am interested in.</string>
  <string id="120608">I am interested in improving my mind.</string>
  <string id="120609">I am concerned with spiritual matters.</string>
  <string id="120610">Have you encountered any interesting gems?</string>
  <string id="120611" soundid="181269">I&apos;m eager to try another attempt at this map. The route is rough, but there is something about it that inspires me. I need to see the whole thing for it to make sense.</string>
  <string id="120612" soundid="181270">Ready for another attempt at the map we found in the Furnace? I&apos;m sure completing it will jog my memory even more.</string>
  <string id="120613" soundid="181271">Yes, I&apos;m glad you want to make another attempt. This is very serious. We could rescue the greatest inventor the Empire has ever known. More or less.</string>
  <string id="120614" soundid="181272">Well, that was a bit bumpy. Still, I can tighten up a bolt or two and we&apos;ll be ready to try again! We really should try again, you know?</string>
  <string id="120805" soundid="181463">Lead on. I will follow. What choice do I have?</string>
  <string id="120806" soundid="181464"></string>
  <string id="120807" soundid="181465">Direct me where you wish. I have no say in the matter. That is what you wanted, isn&apos;t it? Unquestioning, meaningless obedience?</string>
  <string id="120808" soundid="181466">I follow as directed. I am capable of nothing else. You sustain me now.</string>
  <string id="120809" soundid="181467">I am thoroughly surprised that I even considered entering this place without being bound to your will. What was I thinking?</string>
  <string id="120810" soundid="181468"></string>
  <string id="120811" soundid="181469">Ya Zhen: What is it now? Hurry with your preparations so we can move on to more... interesting things.</string>
  <string id="120812" soundid="181470">Chai Ka: You are progressing as only you are able. The fate of the Empire is yours to decide.</string>
  <string id="120813" soundid="181471"></string>
  <string id="120816" soundid="181474">Direct me as you must, but do not expect me to like it. I am just a tool to you.</string>
  <string id="120817" soundid="181475">We have to find Master Li and stop him. We can&apos;t let this continue.</string>

  <string id="122782">Here&apos;s some general chit chat coming down the pipe.</string>
  <string id="122783">I&apos;m done.</string>
  <string id="122784">Over a thousand years ago, Emperor Sagacious Tien united the lands that make up the Jade Empire.</string>
  <string id="122785">Use Chi Strikes (press the &lt;ChiStrike&gt; key in combat) to add damage to your attacks.</string>
  <string id="122786">Use Chi to heal yourself (&lt;ChiHeal&gt;), deal more damage (&lt;ChiStrike&gt;), and power magic and transformation styles.</string>
  <string id="122787">Sometimes it is better not to pick up a power-up immediately. It may come in handy later in the battle.</string>
  <string id="122788">When wounded and outnumbered in combat, an Area Attack (&lt;FastAttack&gt; + &lt;StrongAttack&gt;) can buy you enough time to use Chi Heal.</string>
  <string id="122789">Demons are immune to Support styles such as Storm Dragon and Heavenly Wave.</string>
  <string id="122790">Sometimes it is helpful to leap out of the heat of battle and regroup. Use evades (&lt;Block&gt; + &lt;Up&gt;, &lt;Left&gt;, &lt;Down&gt;, or &lt;Right&gt;) to find a better position in combat.</string>
  <string id="122791">Use followers to supplement your preferred styles. A close quarters fighter can complement a character that uses magic at range.</string>
  <string id="122792">A follower assigned to Support mode is ignored by enemies. You are enhanced by their meditations, but you must fight solo.</string>
  <string id="122793">Use &lt;FightStyle1&gt;, &lt;FightStyle2&gt;, &lt;FightStyle3&gt;, or &lt;FightStyle4&gt; to quickly change styles. Press and hold &lt;FightStyle1&gt;, &lt;FightStyle2&gt;, &lt;FightStyle3&gt;, or &lt;FightStyle4&gt; to assign a style. The game will pause during selection, even in combat.</string>
  <string id="122794">Weapon styles are powerful, but they drain your Focus and cannot damage spirits. Versatility is the key to victory.</string>
  <string id="122795">Weapon styles like Fortune&apos;s Favorite or Golden Star are helpful when you&apos;re surrounded. </string>
  <string id="122796">Use Support styles like Heavenly Wave to set your opponents up for devastating Martial-style attacks.</string>
  <string id="122797">All spirits are immune to Support and Weapon styles, but vulnerable to Martial and Magic styles.</string>
  <string id="122798">Harmonic combos are great for finishing off opponents. Read each Martial or Support style&apos;s description to learn its role in harmonic combos.</string>
  <string id="122799">Blocking (&lt;Block&gt;) can save your life when fighting enemies who use projectile attacks.</string>
  <string id="122800">Chi Heal (&lt;ChiHeal&gt;) can make all the difference in combat. Be sure to use it before it is too late.</string>
  <string id="122801">Focus mode (&lt;Focus&gt;) is powerful but taxing. Use it sparingly to escape difficult situations.</string>
  <string id="122802">Your magical weapons drain Focus (the yellow bar) as you use them. Be careful not to run out of Focus at critical moments.</string>
  <string id="122803">Some enemies are immune to certain types of attacks, so vary your tactics in combat by switching styles.</string>
  <string id="122804">Support styles do no damage, but they have significant effects that weaken opponents without consuming your Chi or Focus.</string>
  <string id="122805">Raise or lower difficulty to fit the level of challenge you want. Press &lt;Menu&gt; and select Difficulty from the Options screen at any time.</string>
  <string id="122806">Books and scrolls grant experience and valuable insight into the history of the Empire.</string>
  <string id="122807">Techniques are training aids that permanently modify stats. Choose carefully; powerful increases may be balanced by penalties elsewhere.</string>
  <string id="122808">The Way of the Closed Fist was originally put forth by a philosopher named Bladed Thesis, who felt that strength was the ultimate virtue. 
</string>
  <string id="122809">Pause the game (&lt;CombatPause&gt;) at any time to switch styles or plan your next move.</string>
  <string id="122810">Refer to the Journal for a summary of your active quests, or to review what you have completed.</string>
  <string id="122811">If an opponent is too challenging, adjust difficulty from the Options screen. This change may even be done during combat.</string>
  <string id="122812">Followers in Support mode are ignored by enemies. Your abilities are enhanced but all opponents focus on you.</string>
  <string id="122813">Meditating at Chi and Focus shrines before important battles can give you the edge you need.</string>
  <string id="122814">Surplus essence gems can be sold to merchants for silver.</string>
  <string id="122815">Equipping the right combination of gems can give you a significant boost in certain fights.</string>
  <string id="122816">Violence isn&apos;t the only solution to a problem. Sometimes persuasion can get you out of a tough spot.</string>
  <string id="122817">Explore to find gems to place into your Dragon Amulet. These gems will enhance your abilities.</string>
  <string id="122818">Look for chests and other breakable objects that contain silver or gems. Be careful, some may be rigged with traps.</string>
  <string id="122819">New friends and enemies can come from anywhere. Be mindful in your dealings with the people you meet.</string>
  <string id="122820">Speak to the arena&apos;s fighters to find out more about them and the arena itself.</string>
  <string id="122821">Some styles are difficult to grasp if you do not first understand the particular moral philosophies that make them work.</string>
  <string id="122822">With the way to the underworld blocked, death is only the beginning.</string>
  <string id="122823">Despite their differences, Dawn Star and Silk Fox can be quite powerful if they work together.</string>
  <string id="122824">You are restored to life, but your task is not yet complete.</string>
  <string id="122825">Each of your followers has a unique strength. You will need to rely on them to succeed.</string>
  <string id="122826">Once again Dirge is the site of a major siege. This time, you and your followers are the targets.</string>
  <string id="122827">Doubt can cripple even the most powerful warrior.</string>
  <string id="122828">Your last visit to the palace was a violent one. This time your enemy is more powerful, but so are you.</string>
  <string id="122829">The calm before the storm. With his army repelled, your former Master awaits you in his palace.</string>
  <string id="122830">Your choices will dictate the fate of the Empire. Choose your actions wisely, and keep the consequences in mind.</string>
  <string id="122831">All demons are immune to Support styles, and some are immune to Magic styles.</string>
  <string id="122832">The Long Drought was a dark time in the Empire&apos;s history, but some whisper that darker times are yet ahead.</string>
  <string id="122833">Phoenix Gate, the biggest city in the Prosperous East, is the center of trade in the Jade Empire.</string>
  <string id="122834">The Wall once surrounded and protected a young Jade Empire. Now it stands as a testament to Imperial drive and ambition.</string>
  <string id="122835">The Horselords of the Plain of Barren Hope threatened the Jade Empire&apos;s northern border until Zeng Sai, their greatest warlord, fell to the Imperial Army.</string>
  <string id="122836">The Golden Delta is at once the source of the Empire&apos;s richest farmland and its poorest people.</string>
  <string id="122837">The Outlanders of the Mysterious East wear suits of metal armor and speak in a strange, lilting language unknown in the Jade Empire.</string>
  <string id="122838">The bloodlust of the mad Emperor Zian was so consuming that he sent the Imperial Army after his own subjects in an attempt to slake his murderous impulses.</string>
  <string id="122839">The spiritual teachings of Lao Tsi serve as the basis from which much of Jade Empire society springs.</string>
  <string id="122840">The Celestial Bureaucracy governs the heavens and assigns each spirit its station in creation.</string>
  <string id="122841">Even the mightiest of spirits have strict roles to play. Those who act outside their station often become demons and torment mankind.</string>
  <string id="122842">Women in the Jade Empire enjoy all of the rights of the Empire&apos;s men. Many of the Empire&apos;s finest warriors are women.</string>
  <string id="122843">Elephant demons are viciously territorial guardians, but only for spirits or sorcerers strong enough to inspire loyalty.</string>
  <string id="122844">Horse demons are sadistic creatures that call forth searing flames to torment their victims.</string>
  <string id="122845">Emperor Sun Hai&apos;s withdrawal from the public eye leads some to wonder if he is truly still in control at all.</string>
  <string id="122846">While most demons ignore their given station and enjoy tormenting mortals, some are truly honorable and want only the best for creation.</string>
  <string id="122847">The night before a battle is always restless.</string>
  <string id="122848">Theater in the Jade Empire is rare and entertaining, but only the most skillful of satirists can effect any real insightful message.</string>
  <string id="122849">Magic in the Jade Empire is elemental or spiritual in nature. Anything else is usually considered superstition.</string>
  <string id="122850">While some ogres may seem musclebound and stupid, most possess the skill to craft and use reasonably advanced arms and armor.</string>
  <string id="122851">As hideous and dangerous as they are, ogres are not demons. They are natural creatures made warlike by their territorial nature.</string>
  <string id="122852">The Jade Empire&apos;s use of an explosive substance called dragon powder makes opposing its military a deadly proposition.</string>
  <string id="122853">The Jade Empire was formed when Sagacious Tien united many provinces under his rule, making for a land of diverse names, languages, and cultures.</string>
  <string id="122854">The Lotus Assassins were once known as the Lotus Order, monks dedicated to the protection and spiritual development of the presiding emperor.</string>

Travelers in the Great Southern Forest often report strange sightings and bizarre phenomena. Aside from the hospitality of the Pilgrim&apos;s Rest Inn, the forest is nearly entirely wilderness, and the verdant canopy of the forest hides wonderful and fearsome creatures unlike any seen anywhere else in the Empire. 

The strangest tales are those of a shadow among the trees that seems to follow visitors to the forest. Philosophers hoping to reflect in the peace of the forest often report feeling watched, and patrons of the Pilgrim&apos;s Rest Inn claim to have seen a strange silhouette darting among the trees. Despite the apparently otherworldly nature of this figure, those who witness it sense no aggression and attribute it to the mysteries of the forest.</string>
  <string id="123300">The Physical Universe: A Rebuttal</string>
  <string id="123301">
The world that we live in is not as simplistic as Philosopher Jiang would suggest in his treatise on the physical universe. His hypotheses regarding divine regulation of weather and seasons, though interesting, is nothing more than children&apos;s tales made overly complicated. Recent research, led by Scholar Dongow, has proven that our seasons and weather are much more than the careless whims of distant celestial beings. Our universe is made up of very real, very tangible components that can be carefully quantified and qualified.</string>
  <string id="123302">The Physical Universe: The Philosopher&apos;s Viewpoint</string>
  <string id="123303">
Though Scholar Shao Shiang has raised several interesting points in his rebuttal to my treatise on the physical world, his lack of respect for the divine is of greater concern than his lack of understanding of the physical world around him. I agree that there are many aspects to our world that cannot be explained by divine influence alone. We learn and continue to thrive at the mercy of the celestial beings. Without their guidance, and indeed, their blessing, we would quickly discover that research and understanding of our physical world alone are not nearly enough for us to survive.</string>
  <string id="123304">The Physical Universe: The Scholar&apos;s Hypothesis</string>
  <string id="123305">
To suggest that I, of all people, do not understand the significance or the importance of the celestial beings is preposterous. I pay my tributes at the temple because I honor those who gave us our minds and our curiosity. Philosopher Jiang ignores the crux of the problem by hiding behind his arguments of divine belief. The scholars have made some recent discoveries, such as the way in which clouds are formed. But the philosophers, lead by Jiang, dismiss these theories without even hearing them out. How can we progress as a society if we refuse to accept new ideas and new concepts? The philosophers would have us cling to our traditions, even at the cost of our own prosperity.</string>
  <string id="123307">The Physical Universe: A Final Word</string>
  <string id="123308">
Scholar Shao Shiang has once again missed the central point of the philosophers&apos; argument. We do not wish to stall development, nor do we seek to stop people from learning. Philosophers see the work of the divine in the physical world and oppose those who defy tradition only because they find those customs inconvenient or outdated. Learning and respect for the past need not be mutually exclusive; we seek only to learn in a way that does not dishonor the celestial beings that give us our very lives.</string>

2. Do you have your clothes? Are you wearing them? If you don&apos;t see your clothes nearby, you&apos;ll probably never find them, so don&apos;t waste time looking. If you really need clothes for some reason, take what you need from the nearest dead bodies.
3. Are you in a bed? Is there someone with you? I&apos;ve learned from past mistakes, waking up with someone usually turns out badly. Get your clothes and leave quietly.
4. Is anyone still alive nearby? Don&apos;t be shocked. Sometimes I pass out before I start fighting. Since the people nearby probably won&apos;t be up for a fight for some time, it&apos;s best just to move on and find another place to stay for the day.</string>

To Kill a Spirit

A wise monk once asked, &quot;How can you kill a thing that is already dead?&quot; The answer is simple: You cannot. You can, however, disperse a spirit. This is not the same as killing, but it has a similar effect. It is important to remember that spirits are virtually immune to man-made weapons. You must confront spirits with martial, magic, or transformation styles. Never underestimate the strength of spirits. They may appear insubstantial, but they can still be deadly to the living.</string>

Of all threats the young Jade Empire faced, the greatest was the barbarian warlord Zeng Sai. Titled &quot;The Tree that Defies the Fire,&quot; Zeng Sai managed to organize the barbaric Horselords into an efficient and deadly machine of warfare, conquering much of the lands to the west and north of the Empire before coming to bear on the borders of the Jade Empire itself. Zeng Sai, whose savagery denied even the great Wall built to keep his people out, led his hungry, maddened people to attack our fledgling Empire in a rabid attempt to destroy all that would become our advanced and prosperous civilization. 

So vicious and deadly was Zeng Sai&apos;s attack that it roused the insular Spirit Monks from their temple in the Land of Howling Spirits to come to the Empire&apos;s aid. Left unconquered by the devouring Horselord army, the monks of Dirge stood alongside the Empire and, in a great battle recounted by sages, playwrights, and scholars around the known world, laid waste to Zeng Sai and his ravenous army of wild bowmen. With the help of the monks from Dirge, the Empire finally burned down the Tree that Defies the Fire, and our glorious land has never since faced so deadly a foe.</string>

When the Great Dam came, few believed that the Emperor would allow us to come to harm, but harm came in the form of water that covered our homes and buried our families. When the flooding came to an end, the town of Tien&apos;s Landing lay submerged beneath this new sea, where only ghosts and ruined homes could flourish.

The first known successful flight was made by Mad Fong. Though he had studied to become a scholar, he was kicked out of the school for destroying one of their buildings. Based on the history books, it is difficult to determine if Fong was a genius, or insane. Either way, his techniques were original and in the end, successful. Though his first several attempts were unsuccessful, he refused to give up. Despite the costs and the obvious danger to his own life, Fong persevered until he completed his first prototype flyer.

Initial attempts bordered on apocalyptic, in one case destroying half of a mountainside and the village that lay below. Several scholars tried to outlaw the use of this strange new energy source, but Shu Wen continued his experiments until at last he was successful. Unfortunately, his prototype was too successful; both he and the flyer took off at great speeds toward the north, and neither was ever seen again.</string>

Though some demons are not evil, they are all powerful, and rarely can they be trusted. If confronted by a malicious demon, it is important to remember that they are usually immune to magic, especially the larger demons. You can successfully combat them with weapons and simple martial styles. Strangely enough, on those rare occasions when demons and ghosts were seen to tangle the strange magics used by the ghosts seem to affect these malevolent beasts.</string>

  <string id="123859">
Some time after Scholar Shu Wen and his prototype flyer disappeared, an apprentice from the Imperial City discovered the scholar&apos;s cryptic notes, detailing the use of the Inscrutable Power Source. The apprentice showed the information to his master, General Sung Tao. Sung Tao was an engineer before he joined the army, and he recognized the potential of the scholar&apos;s work. He convinced Emperor Sun Siwen to fund a project to develop a flyer for use in the army. The emperor agreed readily and after several months of trying the first true flyer was created. Within a year the skies near the Imperial Palace were filled with flyers. Though the safety of the new flyers was questionable, it didn&apos;t take long for others to adopt and improve upon the design.</string>

Valued Customer:

While we appreciate your business, the staff of the Heart of the Empire politely requests that you keep your nose out of ours. To assure that you will no longer wish to pry into our recipes, please enjoy this excerpt recently unearthed in the south.

Leg of Lam
This hearty meal was first discovered after Yu Lam the Hunter stumbled upon our community. For five to ten people, use just one leg (the other can be pickled for later or roasted slowly and smoked to preserve it). For larger groups, use both legs of an adult male or female. Boil the legs in a large pot for two hours with the following ingredients: twenty gallons of fresh water, three tablespoons of salt, half a cup of rosemary, three cups of spiced wine (summer wine is best if you can get it), three bags of onions, four whole garlic cloves, and a dash of ginger. When the legs have about half an hour left, add some skinned potatoes and leeks. Can be served on the bone or in steaks.

Gaze upon these words with reverence, for they offer some small slice of the history of the most glorious contest in the arena.

The Ravager:
Deadly, cold, and precise. The Ravager refuses to speak and shows no care for the crowd, but none can question his deadly strength. Wildly popular with the more bloodthirsty members of our crowd, the Ravager&apos;s rare fights are always sold out.

Raging Ox:
All of the Imperial City fondly remembers Raging Ox, our recently retired Imperial Champion. Quick with a smile and famous for his antics both in and out of the ring, Ox&apos;s legend will live many lifetimes.

Kai Lan the Serpent:
Kai Lan&apos;s phenomenal control over magic and his intense focus made him one of the greatest champions to grace the ring of the Imperial Arena. Cold and imperious, Kai Lan played to the crowd to cultivate a love/hate relationship that has persisted to this day.</string>

Let the true name of our newest champion be lauded across the Empire, for the champion&apos;s feats have preserved, and even restored, the honor of the Imperial Arena. Brilliant and deadly, our newest Imperial Champion truly deserves the title.

The Ravager:
None shall speak of this champion. The dishonor done to a thousand years of tradition by this creature will forever be a stain upon the fabric of our Empire.

  <string id="124017">
The ability to bind a spirit is one of the great honors that the Water Dragon has bestowed upon us. Therefore, we must always remember to treat this gift with the proper respect. When you bind a spirit, you become the guardian of that spirit. It is as though the spirit is your child. Though it is your duty to return the spirit to the Water Dragon for her judgment, until you give the spirit over to her, you are fully responsible for that spirit.

Since the spirit will obey your every command, you must always have the best interests of the spirit in mind while it is under your control. You must never command a spirit to do anything that might affect the Water Dragon&apos;s judgment of that spirit later on. And though it is the most common rule when binding spirits, I will repeat it again: Under no circumstances will you ever bind the spirit of a living person. Such acts are punishable by death and judgment at the hands of the Water Dragon herself.</string>
  <string id="124018">Abbot Song&apos;s Journal</string>
  <string id="124019">
Something is wrong. The Water Dragon won&apos;t speak of it openly, but I can sense that she is troubled by something. No one else suspects, not even her caretakers. But she is the Water Dragon, and if she wants us to know, surely she will tell us.

Still, the storm continues to grow. Last week, one of the fountain guardians actually left their post unattended. And there were more conflicts among the monks this past year than I care to recall. The storm is building strength, and it seems poised to strike right at the heart of Dirge. I cannot say for certain, but I believe the Spirit Monks, the whole Empire in fact, is in grave danger. I can only trust that Water Dragon also senses it, and is preparing for whatever may come.

Lesser chance of Health power-ups

A battlefield is chaotic enough without leaving one&apos;s successes to chance. Some warriors prefer to rely upon solid and predictible strengths rather than the random chance of respite during battle. This gem strengthens the wearer&apos;s inherent physical abilities, taking away the warrior&apos;s reliance on fate to provide assistance. </string>
  <string id="124341">Mind +2
Lesser chance of Focus power-ups

The concepts of mental focus and of distraction are mutually exclusive. Many believe that one cannot succeed in a mental capacity by always relying on the subtle whims of fate to fuel one&apos;s success. This gem enhances its wearer&apos;s inherent mental abilities while weaning the warrior from reliance on fate&apos;s fickle favor. </string>
  <string id="124342">Spirit +2
Lesser chance of Chi power-ups

To some, being prepared for any situation is the very essence of wisdom. While the world rewards those who excel, many warriors find that relying upon these rewards can lead to laziness and recklessness in battle. Only be bolstering one&apos;s natural spirit can one truly master the art of shaping one&apos;s Chi. This gem strengthens its wielder&apos;s spiritual reserves, but it removes the temptation to rely on the untrustworthy whims of fate. </string>
  <string id="124350">Lucky Hand</string>
  <string id="124351">More silver from human enemies

When properly prepared, this gem plucks the silken strands of fate, gently placing small amounts of local currency in the pockets of the people within a certain distance of the wielder. Used in more innocent times to subtly bolster the wealth of the poor, these gems have fallen into misuse, and pickpockets now use it to pad the pouches of those from whom they steal.</string>

Chi +5

Despite their tiny stature, the cannibals of the Pilgrim&apos;s Rest Inn possess surprising strength and resiliance. Their connection with the ancient beast known as The Mother has made them strong, and they have rewarded your aid with a scroll that granted a light touch of the magic that affects them. There&apos;s no chance you will end up twisted like those creatures, but you do have occasional cravings for meat.</string>
  <string id="124357">Focus +5

Many craftsmen repeat litanies in their heads while they work, the repetition helping them focus. A warrior who has learned the power of such exercises can adapt their medatative nature to the battlefield with much the same results.</string>

Burning Essence channels elemental flame to sharpen the mind of its wearer and to strengthen the ability to channel chi.

Among the first monks who developed the Tempest style, there was one who began to question the Closed Fist tenets of his order. Ostracized from his ruthless order, the monk sought new ways to harness the wind without relying upon Closed-Fist chaos. By focusing his hatred for his old order into a handful of small stones, he managed to replicate the power of Tempest in those stones. A stone of this type surrounds the wearer in swirling winds that whip and tear at any who harm the stone&apos;s wielder. </string>

Those who hunt ghosts and wayward spirits often find that the knowledge gained from defeating ephemeral foes is more useful than the recouperative pockets of essence that they leave behind.

  <string id="124425">Focus +7

The last remnants of the Emperor&apos;s cursed army have dispersed from Dirge and yet you can still hear whispers of thanks on the winds. Far from a distraction, they serve as a reminder of the tasks ahead, and make it all the easier to steel your will.</string>
  <string id="124426">Health +15

In the battle against the elder horse demon that followed you out of the gateway in Dirge, a splinter off of its leering skull-like visage became lodged under the skin of your forearm. It causes you no pain or irritation, and it seems that some measure of the magic that sustained the elder beast has come with it.</string>

  <string id="124640" soundid="188487">Well, there was that time in the Necropolis but me and about four generations of mourners really want to forget that. Uh. I need more wine.</string>
  <string id="124641" soundid="188488">I never go looking, I just finish what other people start. Except wine casks. Those are pretty much all mine if the innkeep knows what&apos;s good for him.</string>

  <string id="124645" soundid="188492">Ah, like we agreed after you beat me in the arena, we don&apos;t want our common enemies to know we work together now.</string>
  <string id="124646" soundid="188493">Yes, best to play it cagey and keep them guessing. I&apos;ll drink to that!</string>

  <string id="124666">Fine, fine, what is it you do?</string>
  <string id="124669" soundid="188516">Hello, Mistress. What do you need? You have earned a good discount at any shop in the village.</string>
  <string id="124670" soundid="188517">No discounts!</string>
  <string id="124671" soundid="188518">Er, yes, perhaps he is not the best choice to send against some sharpie grifter.</string>
  <string id="124672" soundid="188519">Smart guys fall down too. I don&apos;t see what difference it makes.</string>
  <string id="124673" soundid="188520">You&apos;re a bit slow to the races, aren&apos;t you? I said I hit things. How many times do you have to go over it?</string>
  <string id="124674" soundid="188521">Eh, forgive me, Mistress, but this *is* only a demo. I am uncertain if your other followers currently have... heads.</string>
  <string id="124675" soundid="188522">Stinking Whirlwind has his head and doesn&apos;t use it! The others would be worse?</string>
  <string id="124676" soundid="188523">Please, wife, as a supporting comedic foil I have a good chance of surviving to a sequel. Don&apos;t enrage the drunken axeman.</string>
  <string id="124677" soundid="188524">It&apos;s early enough that my part could be replaced by &quot;Henpecked Mo.&quot;</string>
  <string id="124678" soundid="188525">Your followers have different strengths. Wisdom will tell you who is best for the task. Unfortunately only Whirlwind is available right now.</string>
  <string id="124679" soundid="188526">You&apos;ll have to come back later, Mistress. We must wait for the Black Whirlwind to return. These things take time.</string>
  <string id="124680" soundid="188527">You are too slow. You bring me shame.</string>
  <string id="124681" soundid="188528">Yes, thank you, wife, for your continued support. Like a helpful spirit, always there. Always.</string>
  <string id="124682" soundid="188529">Everyone knows how you sent Sagacious Lu to... ah... &quot;negotiate&quot; in the Shining Falls landowners&apos; dispute. The farmers were wise to ask your help.</string>
  <string id="124683" soundid="188530">Now more produce will go to the people instead of being used as tribute to an overlord. I may even be able to reduce prices because of it.</string>
  <string id="124684" soundid="188531">Many people will profit because of you, Mistress. Your status has greatly improved in the eyes of the people.</string>
  <string id="124685" soundid="188532">As I&apos;ve said, everyone is talking about how you helped the farmers of Shining Falls. I haven&apos;t heard of much else besides that.</string>
  <string id="124686" soundid="188533">No time for rumors! You have work to do!</string>
  <string id="124687" soundid="188534">(sigh) Yes, wife, thank you for reminding me that life and marriage are chores to be cherished.</string>
  <string id="124688" soundid="188535">Of course, Mistress. I await your return.</string>
  <string id="124689" soundid="188536">Back so soon, Mistress Wu? What can I do for you?</string>
  <string id="124690" soundid="188537">Yes, yes, thank you, wife. Such a gentle spirit. Leave me to business.</string>
  <string id="124691" soundid="188538">You know me, Mistress Wu. I manage the village based on your decisions. It is a temporary honor while Master Li is away.</string>
  <string id="124692" soundid="188539">I would much rather be a simple bunmaster, but we all must make sacrifices for the good of the village.</string>
  <string id="124693" soundid="188540">What sacrifice? I do all your work now!</string>
  <string id="124694" soundid="188541">I would help, wife, but the buns must wait. The buns... must wait.</string>
  <string id="124695" soundid="188542">Again? I&apos;m sure there are better things for you to do. I don&apos;t want to bore you.</string>
  <string id="124696" soundid="188543">Forgive me, but I think my wife might disapprove of your... repeated interest in me.</string>
  <string id="124697" soundid="188544">No whispering!</string>
  <string id="124698" soundid="188545">(sigh) Yes, wife, thank you for your trust. A melodious wind from the Celestial Temple itself.</string>
  <string id="124699" soundid="188546">Ah, of course, you&apos;ve probably heard of the trouble along the southern border. The farmers of Endless Fields require your advice.</string>
  <string id="124700" soundid="188547">A hawker has been swindling their money, claiming to sell medicines that let you live forever. He bullies them into buying.</string>
  <string id="124701" soundid="188548">This is a matter best handled by one of your followers. Just tell me who should be sent and I will ready supplies.</string>
  <string id="124702" soundid="188549">Er... at present only... only Whirlwind is available.</string>
  <string id="124703" soundid="188550">(Burp) That&apos;s &quot;the Black Whirlwind&quot; tap-monkey. Get it straight or ready your weapon.</string>
  <string id="124704" soundid="188551">Eh, yes, my mistake. The Black Whirlwind is ready, Mistress. I&apos;m sorry, but he is all that we have right now.</string>
  <string id="124705" soundid="188552">I will point him in the right direction, and have a report ready when he returns. It may be several days.</string>
  <string id="124706" soundid="188553">A report? My results will be in the red of the river and the crying of their children! This trickster will steal no more!</string>
  <string id="124707" soundid="188554">Have the wine ready, I&apos;ll be back before dawn!</string>
  <string id="124708" soundid="188555"></string>
  <string id="124709" soundid="188556">This... may not go well. I&apos;ll let you know when he comes back. Is there anything else? Maybe some buns?</string>
  <string id="124710" soundid="188557">Actions like these affect how you are seen by the people. It might improve trade or your social standing.</string>
  <string id="124711" soundid="188558">Not like you. Always the bunmaster, lower than low.</string>
  <string id="124712" soundid="188559">Yes, thank you, wife, for your... interesting opinion of my stability.</string>
  <string id="124713" soundid="188560">I will speak for myself. My greatest strength is... uh, strength. I hit things and they fall down. Repeat as necessary.</string>
  <string id="124716">Why is he the only one ready to go?</string>
  <string id="124720">Why would it matter who I send?</string>
  <string id="124724">Is there any news that you know of?</string>
  <string id="124729">I&apos;ll be going now.</string>
  <string id="124730">Tell me about yourself.</string>
  <string id="124737">I&apos;m here about business.</string>
  <string id="124740">Who is available for this task?</string>
  <string id="124743">Very well. The Black Whirlwind will go to help them.</string>
  <string id="124748">How will helping these farmers benefit me?</string>
  <string id="124751">What strengths does the Black Whirlwind have?</string>
  <string id="124754" soundid="188601"></string>
  <string id="124755" soundid="188602">Good day, Mistress. I hope you were able to sleep well last night. There was a howling wind that kept most of the students up.</string>
  <string id="124756" soundid="188603">It was... very strange, but I will try to not let it interfere with my duties.</string>
  <string id="124757" soundid="188604">This is not the season for such storms. I&apos;ve also had some troubling dreams, and that wind blows right through them.</string>
  <string id="124758" soundid="188605">Yes Mistress.</string>
  <string id="124759" soundid="188606">Yes Mistress.</string>

  <string id="124764" soundid="188611">It is just like the dreams. Just like....</string>

  <string id="126338" soundid="191306">I could not see or hear her, human. Only you seem close enough to pick the whispers from the air. All I could catch was a scent, but it was one I knew well. I know what you must do now.</string>

  <string id="126341" soundid="191309">Had I acted sooner, I would have been able to crush her easily, but she is insidious. Her corruption spread slowly until it suddenly erupted like a fungal bloom.</string>
  <string id="126342" soundid="191310">Now the forest is in a delicate balance. She is not yet strong enough to destroy me, but I find myself in the same situation. You could tip that balance.</string>
  <string id="126343" soundid="191311">And leave my forest sickened and twisted? In you I have the chance to enlist the aid of one human who might be able to tip the scales.</string>

  <string id="126345" soundid="191313">I do not think you will win, human. I am not as strong as I was, but I am still more than your match. I also know that decisions made by you could have sweeping effects.</string>

  <string id="126348" soundid="191316">There are caves beneath the Pilgrim&apos;s Rest. They are infested with cannibals, and the creatures work tirelessly to free their mistress.</string>
  <string id="126349" soundid="191317">For all their diggings they will not completely free her until I am destroyed... or until I release her. And that is exactly what I plan to do.</string>
  <string id="126350" soundid="191318">You must go to the Pilgrim&apos;s Rest. I will release the seal on the door beneath the inn so that you may enter her lair.</string>
  <string id="126351" soundid="191319">You have already seen the corruption firsthand. There will be many more of her &quot;children&quot; below, closer to her lair.</string>
  <string id="126352" soundid="191320">The people of the inn are her followers now, and they are nothing more than cannibalistic monsters. They will know that we have allied, and you will have to face them.</string>
  <string id="126353" soundid="191321">Individually, these cannibals are not exceptionally strong or skilled, but they are fast, and they attack in groups.</string>
  <string id="126354" soundid="191322">Inside that place, at the back, you will find a lift descends to what was once a storage area. Once I release the seal on the Mother&apos;s trap, many more caves will open.</string>
  <string id="126355" soundid="191323">Her followers have been most prodigious in their work to free her. The hill is riddled with caves and tunnels that connect to the old mine workings at the hill&apos;s base.</string>
  <string id="126356" soundid="191324">Once the seal is broken, I will not be able to close it again. You must not fail.</string>
  <string id="126357" soundid="191325">You will find a way to defeat the Mother, and you will survive. You must. I will find you after she is dead.</string>
  <string id="126358" soundid="191326">You think I will prove the easier opponent, human? The Mother&apos;s corrruption has weakened me, but not so much that I will fall to the likes of you.</string>
  <string id="126359" soundid="191327">How quick, how efficient. Did your Emperor reassure himself with such platitudes when he stole the power of the Water Dragon?</string>
  <string id="126360" soundid="191328">You challenge powers beyond your station, human! How your empire does not buckle under the weight of such arrogance I will never know.</string>
  <string id="126361" soundid="191329">You will not win this fight, human. I cannot allow it. My strength is all that traps the Mother in the caves beneath the inn. If I die, she will be free soon after.</string>
  <string id="126362" soundid="191330">The Water Dragon may have her hopes invested in you, but I cannot lose my forest to that abomination. Come, follow me to lowest of my islands, if you can!</string>

  <string id="126364" soundid="191332">You have come, following the path I laid down for you. But now you have reached the fork and must make your own choices. I will try to help you in this. </string>
  <string id="126365" soundid="191333">I am the Forest Shadow - I will help you understand the significance of what happens in my forest. And then I shall be most intrigued to see which fork you choose to take.</string>
  <string id="126366" soundid="191334">I am well aware of the glittering prizes that have been placed before you by Lord Yun and the Innkeeper. But you would be wise to listen to my words so you will understand.</string>
  <string id="126367" soundid="191335">You were attacked at the bridge by a mad fox spirit. The spirit tried to kill you, yet you fought her off. You survived because I had no intention of harming you.</string>
  <string id="126368" soundid="191336">I hoped to confuse you, to force you to question what was truly happening in this forest. You need to understand.</string>
  <string id="126369" soundid="191337">The man on the bridge was from the inn. He was no longer human, despite the illusion that concealed him. I couldn&apos;t risk that he would find a way out of the forest.</string>
  <string id="126370" soundid="191338">They hate me because I oppose the creature they serve. All of the people in the inn are... corrupt. They cloak themselves in spells to conceal the horrors they have become.</string>
  <string id="126371" soundid="191339">Ah, the hunter. He is a true soul. But while he may suspect, he knows nothing of the corruption in the inn. He knows nothing of the real reason my forest suffers.</string>
  <string id="126372" soundid="191340">I have no doubt he would be an ally if I called, but he does not possess your skills. He cannot deal with creatures that cloak themselves in human guises in the Pilgrim&apos;s Rest.</string>
  <string id="126373" soundid="191341">The people of the Pilgrim&apos;s Rest have become inhuman beasts, corrupted by an ancient demon known as the Mother.</string>
  <string id="126374" soundid="191342">The Mother was awoken by the rage of the spirits of the dead. Those denied passage to the underworld with the death of the Water Dragon. She feeds on their anger.</string>

  <string id="126379">Why did you attack me in the forest?</string>
  <string id="126380">There&apos;s two rich rewards on your head, fox. Being cryptic won&apos;t save you.</string>
  <string id="126381">Your death earns me Lord Yun&apos;s wind map, fox. Being cryptic won&apos;t save you.</string>
  <string id="126384">Why did you kill the man I met on the bridge?</string>
  <string id="126385">Why do the people in the inn hate you so much?</string>
  <string id="126386">Why didn&apos;t you attack Spear Catches Leaf? Why me?</string>
  <string id="126388">Enough mysterious hints. What&apos;s really happening in the inn?</string>
  <string id="126389">What *is* really going on here?</string>
  <string id="126392">How can I know you&apos;re not lying? The people in the inn looked human to me!</string>
  <string id="126395">How can she feed on anger of spirits?</string>
  <string id="126397">Where did this demon come from?</string>

  <string id="126400">So why am *I* so important?</string>
  <string id="126401">The man at the bridge was one of the cannibals. Were you trying to warn me?</string>
  <string id="126402">This must have something to do with the cannibals.</string>
  <string id="126403">The cannibals at the Pilgrim&apos;s Rest were smug like this, too.</string>
  <string id="126406">How could you be certain I&apos;d come here?</string>
  <string id="126407">It&apos;s time to put all the pieces on the board, fox. What makes me so important?</string>
  <string id="126410">I have been having visions of a spirit in blue, could that be her?</string>
  <string id="126411">The Water Dragon is not my mistress. I&apos;m not a Spirit Monk.</string>
  <string id="126416">Why me? Why doesn&apos;t she ask you for help?</string>
  <string id="126417">Can you explain anything the Water Dragon said? She speaks in riddles.</string>
  <string id="126420">Why don&apos;t you just destroy the Mother yourself?</string>
  <string id="126423">Couldn&apos;t you just tell Yun to give me the wind map?</string>

  <string id="126438">I will make my way to the inn immediately.</string>
  <string id="126439">I want to ask some more about you and this forest before I go.</string>
  <string id="126440">I&apos;ll make your death swift, fox.</string>
  <string id="126441">I just need a wind map. If you&apos;d helped me with that, it wouldn&apos;t come to this.</string>
  <string id="126443">This forest has had enough interference. I will destroy both of you and be done.</string>
  <string id="126444">If you were strong enough to keep your forest pure, I wouldn&apos;t have to eliminate you.</string>

  <string id="126500" soundid="192167"></string>
  <string id="126501" soundid="192168">You look like you have something on your mind. What&apos;s the matter?</string>
  <string id="126502" soundid="192169">It&apos;s a rare variant of a staff called a monk&apos;s spade, but more than that, I believe this particular one to be called Tien&apos;s Justice.</string>
  <string id="126503" soundid="192170">A monk&apos;s spade is a deadly adaptation of a simple tool. It&apos;s a graceful weapon, wielded like a staff, but with a bladed end. Most deadly.</string>
  <string id="126504" soundid="192171">This monk&apos;s spade is ancient, and some say it was even used by our first Emperor, Sagacious Tien. Whether that&apos;s true or not, this is a fine, fine weapon.</string>
  <string id="126505" soundid="192172">You know, I have never asked him. Something about his expression whenever he speaks of it suggests to me that it&apos;s best if no one asks.</string>
  <string id="126506" soundid="192173">I certainly don&apos;t think he was ever a monk. Perhaps an order gave it to him as a gift for some great deed. It&apos;s hard to say.</string>
  <string id="126507" soundid="192174">All I know is that thinking of this staff seems to bother your Master. Don&apos;t pester him about it. Seeing you finally use it will be enough for him, I think.</string>
  <string id="126508" soundid="192175">There&apos;s no need to thank me. I&apos;ve just held on to it for you. Of course, that&apos;s not all. Master Li also asked that I give you this: Fortune&apos;s Favorite.</string>
  <string id="126509" soundid="192176">Settle yourself. I didn&apos;t say I was finished. Your Master is a resourceful man. He also wanted me to give you this: Fortune&apos;s Favorite.</string>
  <string id="126510" soundid="192177">This long sword is said to be crafted by Shining Fortune, the blacksmith of the gods himself. One look tells you its clearly no normal blade.</string>
  <string id="126511" soundid="192178">I don&apos;t know where Master Li came across something so stunning, but he asked that I give it to you when the time came.</string>
  <string id="126512" soundid="192179">You know you came here with Master Li as just a babe. I came not long after, and I&apos;ve been holding onto a weapon for you ever since.</string>
  <string id="126513" soundid="192180">Well, two actually, but you need to choose which one you&apos;ll take. Master Li wants you to stay focused on your first weapon.</string>
  <string id="126514" soundid="192181">Anything? *Everything.*</string>
  <string id="126515" soundid="192182">I don&apos;t know where your master acquired these, but he has honored me with the care of two legendary weapons.</string>
  <string id="126516" soundid="192183">You may arm yourself with either the legendary long sword, Fortune&apos;s Favorite, or the famed staff, Golden Star.</string>
  <string id="126517" soundid="192184">They say this blade was created in the forge of Smiling Fortune, blacksmith to the gods. Crafted for his son, this blade eventually found its way into the hands of men.</string>
  <string id="126518" soundid="192185">How your master found it, I cannot say, but this ancient long sword is yours if you wish it.</string>
  <string id="126519" soundid="192186">They say Golden Star was forged as a gift to a water spirit of the Silkworm River.</string>
  <string id="126520" soundid="192187">A young noble convinced the Great Eastern Serpent to fly him to the stars, where he dipped this staff in the tail of a comet.</string>
  <string id="126521" soundid="192188">It could be pure fantasy, but this staff certainly isn&apos;t. It&apos;s strong and has an excellent reach. Your foes will tremble if they see you wielding it.</string>
  <string id="126522" soundid="192189">Your weapon is well deserved, and you&apos;ll need it with these bandits so close.</string>
  <string id="126523" soundid="192190">If you decide you truly don&apos;t like it, however, you can come see me after the bandits are dealt with.</string>
  <string id="126524" soundid="192191">One more thing you need to know. These weapons strike with deadly precision, but to wield them safely you must focus with each strike.</string>
  <string id="126525" soundid="192192">Master Li has been training you so that you&apos;d be ready for this kind of weapon, and the drain won&apos;t be crippling, but you will get tired over time.</string>
  <string id="126526" soundid="192193">I know you are ready for the real thing. Master Li trained you well. I&apos;m glad to help you with this.</string>
  <string id="126527" soundid="192194">That you should. Those people will be looking to you for leadership until Master Li gets back. I know you&apos;ll do well.</string>
  <string id="126528" soundid="192195">The only thing left for you to learn is respect for others. You never can tell who might be an easily offended master of a style you don&apos;t know how to counter.</string>
  <string id="126529" soundid="192196">Ah, I&apos;ve been away from the battlefield for too long, and I&apos;m wasting your time. Go make sure the rest of the town is ready for those bandits.</string>
  <string id="126530" soundid="192197">Senior student! Oh, excuse me, Weapon Master. I did not mean to interrupt.</string>
  <string id="126531" soundid="192198">Calm down, student. At my age, you don&apos;t get upset about the occasional interruption. What has you so flustered?</string>
  <string id="126532" soundid="192199">The bandits! They&apos;ve already been sighted down by the beach, and they&apos;re making their way toward the town!</string>
  <string id="126533" soundid="192200">Master Li hasn&apos;t returned yet with Kia Min. I&apos;m sure he will be back before long, but we must depend on you until he returns.</string>
  <string id="126534" soundid="192201">They&apos;re making their way toward the town now. The few men in the militia weren&apos;t able to stop them.</string>
  <string id="126535" soundid="192202">I...don&apos;t know, but their ship is large. There could be many of them. You have to help, senior student.</string>
  <string id="126536" soundid="192203">I will run to the school and seal the gates.</string>
  <string id="126537" soundid="192204">Make your way to the beach and teach these bandits a lesson! I know you can.</string>
  <string id="126538" soundid="192205">You&apos;ve done well, lad. Go back to the school now. Your friends have some new weapons they&apos;re dying to try out, I&apos;m sure.</string>
  <string id="126539" soundid="192206">If you think that is wise, I will come and do what I can!</string>
  <string id="126540" soundid="192207">I&apos;m sorry, my friend, but Student Si Pat isn&apos;t ready to face real combat. He has only just arrived. He has a big heart, but that is not enough for bandits.</string>
  <string id="126541" soundid="192208">Go to the school. Seal the gates. We will deal with this.</string>
  <string id="126542" soundid="192209">Yes, Dawn Star. I&apos;ll go now. Those gates will stay closed on my watch, you can count on it!</string>
  <string id="126543" soundid="192210">I&apos;m afraid not. She would not be able to handle one of these weapons quite yet.</string>
  <string id="126544" soundid="192211">I&apos;ll explain why in a moment, but suffice it to say that very few people have your aptitude for maintaining focus in battle.</string>
  <string id="126545" soundid="192212">In time, Dawn Star will be able to handle a weapon like this, but don&apos;t discount the blade I gave her. Master Li wanted her to have the keenest steel I could find.</string>
  <string id="126546" soundid="192213">Ah, you&apos;re cheerful today. Have you been teasing him, Dawn Star?</string>
  <string id="126547" soundid="192214">Not that I can recall, but Gujin, there are already bandits here in Two Rivers!</string>
  <string id="126548" soundid="192215">In something of a foul mood, are we? Nothing you can do to cheer her up, Dawn Star?</string>
  <string id="126549" soundid="192216">Not right now, Gujin! There&apos;s already bandits here in Two Rivers!</string>
  <string id="126550" soundid="192217">Go on, teach those bandits some manners!</string>
  <string id="126551" soundid="192218"></string>
  <string id="126552" soundid="192219">Good job with those ruffians! Those bandits weren&apos;t gentle with this town. I&apos;m going to help out with some of the repairs.</string>
  <string id="126553" soundid="192220">I&apos;m just glad you two got a chance to try those weapons out for real. Looks like they handled themselves well, just like you two.</string>
  <string id="126554" soundid="192221">Something else you need?</string>
  <string id="126555" soundid="192222">It&apos;s a sleepy little town usually, and bandit attacks are virtually unheard of. Who wants to rob farmers? Rice isn&apos;t worth enough to carry it away.</string>
  <string id="126556" soundid="192223">The only real visitor we ever have is that strange fellow who came in for supplies once or twice. He&apos;s just some mad hermit, though. He tries to avoid the village proper.</string>
  <string id="126557" soundid="192224">The best thing about this place is Master Li&apos;s leadership. It&apos;s like the man was born to it.</string>
  <string id="126558" soundid="192225">I never caught his name, and he shies away from the village proper so I think he prefers it that way. His visits are so rare I&apos;m not surprised you haven&apos;t heard of him.</string>
  <string id="126559" soundid="192226">Merchant Fen Do won&apos;t even speak of the man. Just gives him a few basic supplies and lets him go.</string>
  <string id="126560" soundid="192227">Oh well, no concern of ours. If a man wants to keep to himself, I say we let him do it.</string>
  <string id="126561" soundid="192228">Oh, be fair. I may be the weapon master around here, but it&apos;s Master Li who really does the training. I help out, but he&apos;s the real reason you two are so good.</string>
  <string id="126562" soundid="192229">I used to be a guard in Broken Path, a little town in the western part of the Empire. It was a sleepy place like this, though the residents were miners, not farmers.</string>
  <string id="126563" soundid="192230">That whole province is called the Hills of the Six Holy Scrolls for a reason. It&apos;s rocky, as rich in minerals as it is in ancient temples.</string>
  <string id="126564" soundid="192231">After the body takes enough of a beating, it just doesn&apos;t fight as well as it once did.</string>
  <string id="126565" soundid="192232">There wasn&apos;t much of it left when I left. The place was empty, and no one in their right mind would return.</string>
  <string id="126566" soundid="192233">About ten years ago, something just...broke loose. Ghosts stormed out of the hills, dozens of &apos;em charging from the west.</string>
  <string id="126567" soundid="192234">We tried to fight them, and it worked to some degree, but these ghosts were howling mad. Some of them didn&apos;t even look human any more. Like monsters, they were.</string>
  <string id="126568" soundid="192235">They came from the hills in the west, but beyond that, no one knows. The scary part is that these days I hear more and more stories about ghosts haunting the roads.</string>
  <string id="126569" soundid="192236">I wonder if we in Broken Path saw the beginning of whatever is happening now. It&apos;s hard to say, but there are an awful lot of rumors about ghosts these days.</string>
  <string id="126570" soundid="192237">I haven&apos;t the whisper of a clue. They simply attacked, all transparent and screaming rage in those hollow voices of theirs.</string>
  <string id="126571" soundid="192238">Ghosts can&apos;t die, but they can be... dispersed is the best word. They come back after a while, though.</string>
  <string id="126572" soundid="192239">I guess there&apos;s no peace for the dead, except to go to the underworld like most everyone does when they die.</string>
  <string id="126573" soundid="192240">We won, but many people joined the ghosts&apos; ranks that day. People were spooked, claiming that the hills were haunted.</string>
  <string id="126574" soundid="192241">Soon enough, Broken Path became an empty path. It was deserted. Still sore from the fighting, I made my way south, to what I&apos;ve found to be more peaceful lands.</string>
  <string id="126575" soundid="192242">Suit yourself. It&apos;s an old saw anyway.</string>
  <string id="126576" soundid="192243">Didn&apos;t quite match what you were looking for, did it?</string>
  <string id="126577" soundid="192244">I&apos;d be happy to make an exchange for you, though it looks like you&apos;ve gotten somewhat proficient with the one you have.</string>
  <string id="126578" soundid="192245">I&apos;d hate to see you lose that experience and familiarity, and you will if you swap to a new weapon.</string>
  <string id="126579" soundid="192246">I&apos;ll admit, you don&apos;t look fully comfortable with it yet. Would you prefer the other weapon?</string>
  <string id="126580" soundid="192247">Are you sure you&apos;d like me to swap your weapon for Fortune&apos;s Favorite?</string>
  <string id="126581" soundid="192248"></string>
  <string id="126582" soundid="192249">You can&apos;t beat the heft of a staff, but I want to make sure you&apos;re certain. A staff&apos;s what you want?</string>
  <string id="126583" soundid="192250"></string>
  <string id="126584" soundid="192251">There you have it. Remember, when you&apos;re dealing with smiths, they&apos;ll be selling you their weapons, not offering them on exchange like your old weapon master would.</string>
  <string id="126585" soundid="192252">Enjoy your new weapon! Now, did you need anything else?</string>
  <string id="126586" soundid="192253">That&apos;s probably for the best. Always hard to get used to a new balance when you&apos;re just starting out.</string>
  <string id="126587" soundid="192254">You&apos;re right. There&apos;s plenty to do.</string>
  <string id="126588" soundid="192255"></string>
  <string id="126589" soundid="192256">Everyone&apos;s heard about Gao the Lesser&apos;s little outburst. It figures he&apos;d try something like that when he was losing.</string>
  <string id="126590" soundid="192257">A rat always flashes his fangs when backed into a corner.</string>
  <string id="126591" soundid="192258">Gao killed someone? And I let him go past here without questioning him? I&apos;m an old fool!</string>
  <string id="126592" soundid="192259">I wish I&apos;d looked to see what he was dragging. That couldn&apos;t have been Dawn Star? He was heading toward the gate. Maybe you can catch him!</string>
  <string id="126593" soundid="192260">There are some fields nearby, but the only place he could get to on foot is the swamp.</string>
  <string id="126594" soundid="192261">He&apos;s a fool if he&apos;s headed that way. That bog is full of bandits and who knows what else.</string>
  <string id="126595" soundid="192262">The Lesser? No. I *heard* him pass, though. Him and that foul mouth of his. He was swearing up a storm heading out of the village.</string>
  <string id="126596" soundid="192263">It sounded like he was dragging something heavy. I doubt he knows how to lift properly. I&apos;m sure he&apos;s never done a day of honest hard labor.</string>
  <string id="126597" soundid="192264">No, she hasn&apos;t been this way. I&apos;ve been testing the balance on some new practice blades that came in with Fen Do&apos;s new shipment, so I might have missed her.</string>
  <string id="126598" soundid="192265">Good luck to you.</string>
  <string id="126599" soundid="192266">Gao must have made his way through the gate.</string>
  <string id="126600" soundid="192267">As I said, if he&apos;s headed for the swamp, he&apos;s a fool. There&apos;s nothing but bandits and beasts in that direction.</string>
  <string id="126601" soundid="192268">Despite that, it still seems the most likely place. He&apos;ll be slowed down by that load. You could still catch him if you hurry!</string>
  <string id="126602" soundid="192269"></string>
  <string id="126603" soundid="192270">It&apos;s good to give due consideration to your choice. Once you start to use a real weapon, you get used to its particular balance very quickly.</string>
  <string id="126604" soundid="192271">You&apos;re adept enough to pick up other weapons later, but this is your first real weapon, so I want you to have the right one.</string>
  <string id="126605" soundid="192272">If it isn&apos;t two of Master Li&apos;s best and brightest! There&apos;s not much left for me to teach you two, so you can&apos;t be here for lessons.</string>
  <string id="126606" soundid="192273">Hello, Weapon Master Gujin. Good day to you.</string>
  <string id="126607" soundid="192274">Oh, there&apos;s no need for titles. Not from you two.</string>
  <string id="126608" soundid="192275">The Old Tongue, you mean? Anyone with half an education understands Tho Fan, and some of us prefer the way it rolls off the tongue.</string>
  <string id="126609" soundid="192276">Don&apos;t act like it&apos;s a surprise. Lots of people speak it, although I suppose it is concentrated mostly in the Prosperous East.</string>
  <string id="126610" soundid="192277">I know I always feel awkward when I try to speak it, but listening to Gujin or Smiling Mountain speak in the Old Tongue always makes me smile.</string>
  <string id="126611" soundid="192278">Already? I assume you dealt with them, and the rest are in for quite a surprise when they get here. Well, no time to waste.</string>
  <string id="126612" soundid="192279">Dawn Star, I watched you practice with that new blade yesterday, and I must say you take to it naturally. I want you to keep it and use it as your own.</string>
  <string id="126613" soundid="192280">This is a great honor. A good weapon is a true warrior&apos;s most treasured possession.</string>
  <string id="126614" soundid="192281">You know you came here with Master Li as just a babe. He brought a most ancient staff with him, and I have held onto it for this day.</string>
  <string id="126616">Gao has killed a student, and now Dawn Star is missing.</string>
  <string id="126621">Have you seen Gao?</string>
  <string id="126623">Gao has killed a student, and now Dawn Star is missing.</string>
  <string id="126624">Have you seen Dawn Star?</string>
  <string id="126625">I&apos;ll be going now.</string>
  <string id="126632">Why do you insist on speaking like that, Gujin?</string>
  <string id="126635">Bandit scouts are here in Two Rivers. Master Li sent me for a weapon.</string>
  <string id="126640">What exactly is a monk&apos;s spade?</string>
  <string id="126641">Why is it called Tien&apos;s Justice?</string>
  <string id="126642">Where did Master Li find this staff?</string>
  <string id="126645">Thank you for this, Gujin.</string>
  <string id="126647">I don&apos;t want to use a staff. You have no other weapon?</string>
  <string id="126651">Where did Master Li find these weapons?</string>
  <string id="126652">Is there anything special about these weapons?</string>
  <string id="126655">Tell me about the long sword, Fortune&apos;s Favorite.</string>
  <string id="126657">I will take Fortune&apos;s Favorite.</string>
  <string id="126658">Let me hear about the staff, Golden Star.</string>
  <string id="126661">I will take Golden Star.</string>
  <string id="126663">Is there anything else?</string>
  <string id="126664">I should go.</string>
  <string id="126667">I should go see to the townsfolk now.</string>
  <string id="126669">Unless you have something else to give me, I&apos;m finished with you.</string>
  <string id="126674">Does Master Li know they&apos;re already here?</string>
  <string id="126675">How far have they come?</string>
  <string id="126676">How many are there?</string>
  <string id="126677">Run back to the school and warn everyone else. I&apos;ll deal with these thugs.</string>
  <string id="126680">Come with me, and we&apos;ll teach these bandits a lesson.</string>
  <string id="126685">Couldn&apos;t you give whichever weapon I don&apos;t pick to Dawn Star?</string>
  <string id="126688">I don&apos;t have time to waste. You have something for me?</string>
  <string id="126695">What are your thoughts on Two Rivers?</string>
  <string id="126698">Who is the strange hermit you mentioned?</string>
  <string id="126701">How did you end up training at this school?</string>
  <string id="126704">What made you take up training?</string>
  <string id="126706">Why did you leave Broken Path?</string>
  <string id="126709">Where did these ghosts come from?</string>
  <string id="126711">Why would they attack your town?</string>
  <string id="126712">How could you defeat ghosts?</string>
  <string id="126714">What happened in the end?</string>
  <string id="126716">I&apos;ll hear the rest of this tale later.</string>
  <string id="126717">Could I exchange my weapon?</string>
  <string id="126720">Could I exchange my weapon for the long sword?</string>
  <string id="126721">Yes, I&apos;m sure.</string>
  <string id="126723">I would prefer Golden Star.</string>
  <string id="126724">Yes, I would like a staff.</string>
  <string id="126727">On second thought, I&apos;d rather not exchange my weapon.</string>

A vague account of the attack on the Spirit Monks of Dirge that maintains Sun Li and Sun Kin died in the assault. Despite obvious bias, some passages hint at the bloody actions that tormented Sagacious Zu:

&quot;Days turned to weeks as denial of the Emperor&apos;s authority continued. The gates of the fortress did not yield until cowards within were convinced to turn on their fellows. Victory was as inevitable as the tide, but losses were felt. Two brothers were claimed by crimes that remain unspoken, lest the heart of the Empire break with the telling. Death&apos;s Hand rose in their stead, to serve while Sun Hai returned life to the withered land. In the weeks that followed, the price of disloyalty was made clear to those in and out of the Emperor&apos;s honored grasp. A difficult time full of changes that not all would accept, but necessary cruelties ensured that no one in the Jade Empire would ever go thirsty again.&quot;</string>

Drains Focus, +25% Damage over Basic Staff Style

As an artifact weapon, Flawless will replace less powerful staves when purchased.

Forged under an auspicious comet, this staff was originally a gift for the Water Spirit of the Silkworm River. A young prince named Seng Lo sought to win the heart of the Water Spirit and had the staff created as a gift. He then convinced the Great Eastern Serpent to fly him to the heavens, where he dipped the staff in the golden comet. The light of the comet dimmed, but the staff became more powerful than any before it. To this day no one knows if Seng Lo won the Water Spirit&apos;s heart, but there is no questioning the magnificence of the staff he created.</string>
  <string id="127217">Weapon Style, Artifact Weapon

As an artifact weapon, the Dragon Sword will replace less powerful swords when purchased.

Before his departure to the unknown, the Celestial Dragon crafted the first true warrior, Lu Fang. Though Lu Fang&apos;s fists were stronger and quicker than any blade, the Celestial Dragon forged the Dragon Sword to give the warrior a weapon worthy of his skill. Hard as dragon scales and sharp as a dragon&apos;s tooth, it is still one of the most formidable swords in the Empire.</string>
  <string id="127218">Weapon Style, Artifact Weapon
Drains Focus, +25% Damage Over Basic Staff Style

As an artifact weapon, Flawless will replace less powerful staves when purchased.

The scrolls of Peng Qi contain the story of a monk who shaped a flawless staff using only swatches of silk. At first, the silk did nothing but polish the rough wood, but after thirty-four years the staff was perfectly smooth, straight, and flawless. After finishing the staff, the monk told his abbot he was going for a walk to test his new staff, and he never returned. An exiled warrior eventually discovered the staff and attached a sharp blade that is every bit as perfect as the staff itself. It has since been adorned with precious metals, but it remains as flawless as ever.</string>

There are those who test themselves with combat, and then there are those who walk the Path of the Warrior. Those who have practiced these ancient techniques--codified over millennia--are possessed of inhuman resilience.</string>
  <string id="127955">Chi +50

The road walked by the monk is one of outward tranquility and inward struggle. A warrior&apos;s life is a denial of peace by its very nature, and yet there are those who have found calm in the shifting tides of battle. A collection of ancient techniques, those who understand the Path of the Monk are remarkably adept at channeling their Chi.</string>
  <string id="127956">Focus +50

The heavens smile upon those who pursue knowledge, but the battle also favors he of the quick mind. The Path of the Scholar is a codified--and cross indexed--series of mediations and exercises designed to hone one&apos;s thoughts. No opponent inspires more fear than one who not only knows what you will do next, but also possesses the speed to counter your strikes with ease.</string>

  <string id="128191">Your followers must be somewhere on the outskirts of Dirge. Find them and seek their assistance.</string>

  <string id="128201">Sky has been up to more than he&apos;s let on. Entertaining offers of betrayal from the Lotus Assassins is a risky proposition, but it seems his wager has paid off. He knew Death&apos;s Hand wouldn&apos;t be easily stopped, but his carefully placed charges have eliminated the Lotus Assassins who came with the dark warrior.</string>

This blade is surprisingly keen and well balanced considering its humble origins. A standard militia blade, it was carried from the abandoned town of Broken Path by Gujin, the guard who would become weapon master of Two Rivers. Since then the blade has been carefully rebalanced, honed and cared for like a treasured heirloom. While it is not inherently magical, the blade seems to never lose its edge. Dawn Star keeps it with her as a reminder of the only place she ever felt she could call home.</string>

When a soldier becomes Captain in the Imperial Army, he is awarded one of these masterwork blades. Carefully balanced and made of the keenest steel, these deadly badges of honor are borne only by the best soldiers in the Empire; all except this particular blade, of course. Purloined from her father&apos;s armory, this blade has been at Silk Fox&apos;s side for many years, and in her hands it moves with deadly precision.</string>

Like two old friends who happen to have razor sharp edges, Whirlwind&apos;s axes have been with him a long time. According to their engravings, they&apos;re called &quot;Left&quot; and &quot;Right,&quot; though some suspect the names to be little more than a mnemonic. Whirlwind simply thinks of these axes as &quot;The Twins,&quot; and considers them his most valuable--and possibly only--possessions. They may lack an epic history, but in Whirlwind&apos;s hands they&apos;re unquestionably deadly.</string>

  <string id="129295" soundid="197874">Hmm... somehow I did not expect you to kowtow so quickly. Or maybe I just hoped you wouldn&apos;t. I get so tired of fawning servants.</string>

The aspirant must possess and study all three before he or she can safely attempt to train in this demanding art. The body must become the anvil, the unyielding surface on which the style is shaped. Sweeping attacks and powerful charges impact so heavily it is like the meeting of hammer and steel, each blow conveying as much energy back to the aspirant. If the body can&apos;t withstand and redirect this energy, Iron Palm is potentially more damaging to the user than the target.</string>

  <string id="130162">One of three meditation doctines required to understand the Iron Palm fighting style. The aspirant must possess and study all three before he or she can safely attempt to train in this demanding art. The aspirant must embody the forge, the structure that focuses the fire and reveals the potential of the anvil. Self-control must balance the long powerful strikes of Iron Palm, or its movements can overwhelm and leave a lesser aspirant prostrate before an enemy.</string>

  <string id="130164">One of three meditation doctrines required to understand the Iron Palm fighting style. The aspirant must possess and study all three before he or she can safely attempt to train in this demanding art. The aspirant must channel the fire, an unwavering commitment of intent. Intensity is the heart of Iron Palm and the raw energy behind its unrelenting attacks. Any aspirant can mimic the style, but without passion the movements will lack true power.</string>
  <string id="130165">The player has found one of the three scrolls for the Viper style. The scroll is part of a powerful gem that previously contained both the Iron Palm and Viper style, which split as these two styles can never function in harmony.</string>
  <string id="130166">One of three meditation doctrines required to withstand the physiological demands of training the Viper fighting style. The aspirant must possess and study all three before he or she can safely attempt to learn this unforgiving art. Viper corrupts the user&apos;s chi to achieve a toxic effect in an opponent, but if applied incorrectly it is more dangerous to the attacker. The aspirant must train to see nerve clusters, not impact points. Hardened muscle can resist and reflect poisoned energy, leaving the untrained with an imbalance that can be fatal.</string>

  <string id="130168">One of three meditiation doctrines required to withstand the physiological demands of training the Viper fighting style. The aspirant must possess and study all three before he or she can safely attempt to learn this unforgiving art. This style creates an imbalance in the wielder, corrupting otherwise beneficial energy into a toxis tough that burns from the inside. To become the fang, the aspirant must embrace the corruption. To poison others, it is necessary to poison yourself.</string>
  <string id="130169">The final Viper scroll has been found and you have learned the Viper style. The Iron Palm scrolls have lost their power and have turned to dust.</string>
  <string id="130170">One of three meditation doctrines required to withstand the physiological demands of training the Viper fighting style. The aspirant must possess and study all three before he or she can safely attempt to learn this unforgiving art. A warrior&apos;s honor is a shield, but also a hindrance. The aspirant is best served by equating honor with the scale, protection that is cast off when it is no longer useful. Viper is not for those who hide behind platitudes. It is vicious, and makes no apology.</string>
  <string id="130171">Martial styles do not always access the energies of mind and body harmoniously. Sometimes imbalance is the source of their power, as it is with Iron Palm and Viper. Each requires possession of three meditation scrolls that prepare the student for the forces that will be encountered. If these disciplines are attempted without complete understanding, the student risks accessing more power than the body can withstand. Knowledge of Iron Palm and Viper is not often shared, as most martial practicioners consider them to be in opposition to classical teaching. If a student happens upon one of the scrolls detailing these styles, he or she cannot and should not attempt to train in the style until gaining the possession of all three. The most difficult and humbling step of any journey is the acceptance of one&apos;s own limitations and confronting whether the journey is possible at all.</string>

Harmonic combinations demand the use of two styles in rapid succession. The first must be of the class called Support, the second from the class known as Martial. Timing is the key: begin with a focused disabling effect, and follow quickly with a powerful barehanded blow. The two actions working in concert will create a harmonic channel in your chi and wreak havoc upon your foe. You must be swift, as the window to create the harmony is limited. Disable your foe, close swiftly as you change style, and strike with all available force. Let nothing stand in your way, but beware. Opponents of great strength may possess the training to resist this technique. Thought will guide you to victory. Harmonic combinations will ensure the journey is swift.</string>

Rhino demons are some of the most powerful demons out there, but they are limited by their slower movement due to their large size. A warrior using this style takes the grand form of a walking Rhino demon, complete with the demon&apos;s rhino horn and huge arms. The Rhino demon has a very effective area clear attack. This form also makes the martial artist immune to all Support styles, just like the Rhino demon itself. </string>
