  <string id="127022">
A vague account of the attack on the Spirit Monks of Dirge that maintains Sun Li and Sun Kin died in the assault. Despite obvious bias, some passages hint at the bloody actions that tormented Sagacious Zu:

&quot;Days turned to weeks as denial of the Emperor&apos;s authority continued. The gates of the fortress did not yield until cowards within were convinced to turn on their fellows. Victory was as inevitable as the tide, but losses were felt. Two brothers were claimed by crimes that remain unspoken, lest the heart of the Empire break with the telling. Death&apos;s Hand rose in their stead, to serve while Sun Hai returned life to the withered land. In the weeks that followed, the price of disloyalty was made clear to those in and out of the Emperor&apos;s honored grasp. A difficult time full of changes that not all would accept, but necessary cruelties ensured that no one in the Jade Empire would ever go thirsty again.&quot;</string>

Drains Focus, +25% Damage over Basic Staff Style

As an artifact weapon, Flawless will replace less powerful staves when purchased.

Forged under an auspicious comet, this staff was originally a gift for the Water Spirit of the Silkworm River. A young prince named Seng Lo sought to win the heart of the Water Spirit and had the staff created as a gift. He then convinced the Great Eastern Serpent to fly him to the heavens, where he dipped the staff in the golden comet. The light of the comet dimmed, but the staff became more powerful than any before it. To this day no one knows if Seng Lo won the Water Spirit&apos;s heart, but there is no questioning the magnificence of the staff he created.</string>
  <string id="127217">Weapon Style, Artifact Weapon
Drains Focus, +25% Damage Over Basic Sword Style

As an artifact weapon, the Dragon Sword will replace less powerful swords when purchased.

Before his departure to the unknown, the Celestial Dragon crafted the first true warrior, Lu Fang. Though Lu Fang&apos;s fists were stronger and quicker than any blade, the Celestial Dragon forged the Dragon Sword to give the warrior a weapon worthy of his skill. Hard as dragon scales and sharp as a dragon&apos;s tooth, it is still one of the most formidable swords in the Empire.</string>
  <string id="127218">Weapon Style, Artifact Weapon
Drains Focus, +25% Damage Over Basic Staff Style

As an artifact weapon, Flawless will replace less powerful staves when purchased.

The scrolls of Peng Qi contain the story of a monk who shaped a flawless staff using only swatches of silk. At first, the silk did nothing but polish the rough wood, but after thirty-four years the staff was perfectly smooth, straight, and flawless. After finishing the staff, the monk told his abbot he was going for a walk to test his new staff, and he never returned. An exiled warrior eventually discovered the staff and attached a sharp blade that is every bit as perfect as the staff itself. It has since been adorned with precious metals, but it remains as flawless as ever.</string>

There are those who test themselves with combat, and then there are those who walk the Path of the Warrior. Those who have practiced these ancient techniques--codified over millennia--are possessed of inhuman resilience.</string>
  <string id="127955">Chi +50

The road walked by the monk is one of outward tranquility and inward struggle. A warrior&apos;s life is a denial of peace by its very nature, and yet there are those who have found calm in the shifting tides of battle. A collection of ancient techniques, those who understand the Path of the Monk are remarkably adept at channeling their Chi.</string>
  <string id="127956">Focus +50

The heavens smile upon those who pursue knowledge, but the battle also favors he of the quick mind. The Path of the Scholar is a codified--and cross indexed--series of mediations and exercises designed to hone one&apos;s thoughts. No opponent inspires more fear than one who not only knows what you will do next, but also possesses the speed to counter your strikes with ease.</string>

  <string id="128201">Sky has been up to more than he&apos;s let on. Entertaining offers of betrayal from the Lotus Assassins is a risky proposition, but it seems his wager has paid off.

This blade is surprisingly keen and well balanced considering its humble origins. A standard militia blade, it was carried from the abandoned town of Broken Path by Gujin, the guard who would become weapon master of Two Rivers. Since then the blade has been carefully rebalanced, honed and cared for like a treasured heirloom. While it is not inherently magical, the blade seems to never lose its edge. Dawn Star keeps it with her as a reminder of the only place she ever felt she could call home.</string>

When a soldier becomes Captain in the Imperial Army, he is awarded one of these masterwork blades. Carefully balanced and made of the keenest steel, these deadly badges of honor are borne only by the best soldiers in the Empire; all except this particular blade, of course. Purloined from her father&apos;s armory, this blade has been at Silk Fox&apos;s side for many years, and in her hands it moves with deadly precision.</string>

Like two old friends who happen to have razor sharp edges, Whirlwind&apos;s axes have been with him a long time. According to their engravings, they&apos;re called &quot;Left&quot; and &quot;Right,&quot; though some suspect the names to be little more than a mnemonic. Whirlwind simply thinks of these axes as &quot;The Twins,&quot; and considers them his most valuable--and possibly only--possessions. They may lack an epic history, but in Whirlwind&apos;s hands they&apos;re unquestionably deadly.</string>

  <string id="129307" soundid="197886">It would not have been proper for her to award it to you herself, but Princess Sun Lian requests that you accept this gift. She looks forward to your next meeting.</string>
  <string id="129308" soundid="197887">I have no doubt. I have questions for you as well. Hopefully, we will both be able to find the answers we need.</string>
  <string id="129309" soundid="197888"></string>
  <string id="129310" soundid="197889">That is quite enough. We will continue this at a later time. We both have questions that we will need answered.</string>
  <string id="129314" soundid="197890">Not here. I trust my personal assistants to keep their tongues, but this matter is best discussed in private.</string>
  <string id="129315" soundid="197891"></string>
  <string id="129316" soundid="197892">The whims of a member of the Imperial Court are not your concern. There are more important things that we need to discuss in private.</string>
  <string id="129317" soundid="197893">Your explanation lies in the simple bow you have given. Everyone around me kowtows low, obeying my whims. Honest opinion is rare.</string>

  <string id="129319" soundid="197895">I think you are a little too bold for your own good, but I suppose it is my fault. I go out of my way to avoid fawning servants.</string>
  <string id="129321">Forgive me, but I am not sure how to address you.</string>
  <string id="129323">Of course. Forgive me, Princess.</string>
  <string id="129326">Of course, Princess Lian. Should we talk elsewhere?</string>
  <string id="129328">Of course, Princess. At your convenience.</string>
  <string id="129330">My apologies, Princess.</string>
  <string id="129332">Don&apos;t blame them for the pampering you demand.</string>
  <string id="129337">I have many questions for you.</string>
  <string id="129339">A rendezvous with the princess! Such a scandal!</string>
  <string id="129342">What information do you have for me?</string>
  <string id="129344">Bah! You just like getting your hands dirty with commoners.</string>
  <string id="129347">A common greeting, but I require an explanation. </string>
  <string id="129349">I don&apos;t bow, and I don&apos;t know you as a princess.</string>

  <string id="129693">One of three meditation doctrines required to understand the Iron Palm fighting style. The aspirant must possess and study all three before he or she can safely attempt to train in this demanding art. The body must become the anvil, the unyielding surface on which the style is shaped. Sweeping attacks and powerful charges impact so heavily it is like the meeting of hammer and steel, each blow conveying as much energy back to the aspirant. If the body can&apos;t withstand and redirect this energy, Iron Palm is potentially more damaging to the user than the target.</string>
